            "PARCHED REVIEW - I was never interested to watch this film, in fact i never heard about this Film before but suddenly some leak news made waves on social media and i had to download film and watch. And now after watching it i'm speechless, i don't have words to appreciate Film but still i am going to write few words so that Real Cinema Lovers won't miss a gem. Acting - Powerpacked ! The film looks so realistic and its characters looks so real that we actually feel their Pain, Happiness and everything. Surely Best Performance of all Actresses in Film especially Radhika Apte shows her Standard actually raises it and Surween Chawla shines in Bindass Attitude. Screenplay - Marvellous ! It never looked stretched or bored despite being Realistic and Social msg film. Some crispy and vulgar scenes to entertain masses are also there. Classes have everything to taste. Music - Not Impressive ! But Background Score definitely works as shiner for some Serious and Meaningful scenes. Dialogues - Hilarious ! Few will make you laugh, few will make you think and some might harass you due to its Vulgarity. Cinematography - Fantastic ! We see Completely Realistic and real Village in Film and credit goes to Cinematographer. Even some scenes which have not been shot in Village/Set (Caves/Sand) looks Real and are eye pleasing.Direction - Speechless ! Yes you read it right, i don't know who was Leena Yadav but now i will remember this name forever just because of this 1 Masterpiece. Direction is Highly Realistic so does its Vulgar so you have to prepare yourself to watch this Film not as a Regular Bollywood Film but as a Highly Realistic Art Cinema. Full Marks to Director and 1 Salute from me. Final Words - Almost a Masterpiece ! Hats Off, Kudos and Salute to makers for making a Film like Parched in India. You need guts to make Art Film in Bollywood which is actually surviving on Useless Commercial Masala Entertainers but Ajay Devgn had guts and he tried it and he Won it. I watched Unrated Version so you might miss some Vulgar and Sex scenes due to Censore Cuts. Few changes would have made this Film a Masterpiece but i think it fell short and became a Classic. Quality Cinema Lovers should not miss Parched at any cost. I'm going with 8/10 Stars, Go for it to have some memorable and Realistic Cinematic Experience.\n",

            "This is a great movie for people who appreciate films and great film makers-in the caliber of Raj Kapoor. RK banner, probably the single most banner, that stood for quality in Indian Films, so much so, the posters are selling at a high premium! Raj Kapoor, poured his heart and soul in making of this movie, almost bankrupting this flamboyant film Maker. The story is down to earth, one of the best non-fiction tale in the Indian films. This movie failed at the box-office mainly because of the inordinate length, even for the Indian audience of the 70s'. Acting wise Raj Kapoor, Simi Agarwal, Achala Sachdev stand out. Raj Kapoor had his actresses dress erotic and provocative but never vulgar or crude as in the current decadence seen in movies like \"Boom\" etc. Albeit, the actresses were invariably on the plump side or at least compared to the emaciated looks of current day actresses!Actress Padmini, who starts of with a non glamorous role for an actress, along with Vijayantimala (\"Sangam\"), were two of the best classical dancers-which an average Westerner would neither appreciate nor has taste for. There were several moments of directorial brilliance as in any RK banner. Young Raju, exposed to the nude teacher, the filming of song \"Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan\"(sadly, this was the song that was played in Raj Kapoor's final journey, after he collapsed while receiving \"Dada Saheb Phalke\" Award-the highest honor-bestowed on a film-maker and died of asthma.) These are the scenes only A, Raj Kapoor could do and that made him one of the most beloved director/actor in the World and till this day brings happiness to the millions with his unique talent. Yes, the movie drags with some redundant song and dance numbers but then again, Raj Kapoor had passion for music and the music of Shankar-Jaikishan (\"Sangam\", \"Shree 420\", Barsaat\", \"Jis Desh Mei Ganga Bahti Hai\",) was one of the selling point in his films. The duo and 'his soul' the singer Mukesh, never let him down till the end. There is nothing like a bad movie from Raj Kapoor. 'Mera Naam Joker' is not in the league of \"Barsaat \" \"Awaara\" or \"Sangam\" but it had his unique stamp.\n",
            "Negative\n",
            "Akele Hum Akele Tum is a very entertaining and charming film. The film seems to have been inspired by two films, Abhimaan and Kramer vs. Karmer. Abhimaan showed the rise of one spouse in the music industry to another's fall, and Kramer vs. Kramer showed two separated parents fighting over their child's custody. The film has bits of both films, though it's much more similar to the latter. There are actually several sequences which are copied frame-by-frame, which is annoying, but I did like the fact that it was like an expansion of the Kramer vs. Kramer plot. It's like showing the motives behind Meryl Streep's character's decision to leave her husband, giving a larger view of what could probably have happened in the middle, and ending it up with a more complete ending. That's why this is one remake which is easier to forgive.Mansoor Khan's direction is very good and it is aided by a very memorable soundtrack and great casting. Anu Malik's music is exceptional and every song stands out (even though some of them, like the film itself, are unoriginal). \"Raja Ko Rani Se\" is very melodious and romantic, \"Aisa Zakham Diya\" is youthful and catchy, \"Akele Hum Akele Tum\" is a great song showing the loving relationship of a father and his son (and the fact that it's actually sung by Udit Narayan and his real-life son Aditya makes it even more convincing), \"Dil Mera Churaya Kyon\" is beautifully melancholic, and \"Dil Kehta Hai\" is another amazingly exciting and romantic gem. All the songs are extremely well pictured in the film. Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala have a fantastic chemistry (I also loved their collaboration in the 1999 film Mann). This is one of Khan's best performances - very mature, very natural, at times restrained and at times temperamental. Koirala is both beautiful and convincing. She is first a young dreamy girl who wants to become a singer, then a married woman, then an angry mother/homemaker whose inferiority complex and dissatisfaction from her life and marriage cause her to try to find a new life, then a reigning singer, then a suffering mother whose determination to get her son back looks almost selfish. She is credible in every shade her character goes through. Tanvi Azmi also gives a very fine performance.Overall, Akele Hum Akele Tum is a very enjoyable family drama. It has bits of everything and is generally well made, although it does tend to be melodramatic at several sequences. It did bother that some scenes were copied frame-by-frame, but as a whole, it is a decently Indianised film and as already said, it updates and expands the Kramer vs. Kramer plot quite effectively. I'm not saying it's a great film, but it is one of those films which show the magic of Bollywood's 1990s, which may not have had the great technical advances of today, but were much more simple, naive and alluring thanks to their very profound Hindi film style, extremely melodious songs and great human and family values.\n",

            "Let me begin by saying that I write this review with a very open mind. I have deliberately refrained from comparing this film to a dozen Hollywood films I have seen in the past. I think its unfair to judge a Bollywood film produced entirely in Hollywood with a budget that's a fraction of the cost of a low budget Hollywood film. Let's judge this cinema as we judge an Indian cinema. The opening sequence of this film sets the atmosphere for a warm summer day in LA. It sets the mood for some sinister event that is yet to happen. Some crime has taken place in the City and the usual suspects are rounded up by the LAPD and questioned. The usual suspects being: the Yashvardhan Rampal \"Major\" (Amitabh Bachan), Jay Rehan 'Ajju' (Sanjay Dutt), Marc Issak (Sunil Shetty), Raj Yadav (Mahesh Manjrekar), Anand Mathur (Kumar Gaurav), and Maqbool Haider (Lucky Ali). None of them trust each other, yet they team up to rob a bank. (By mentioning the words \"usual suspects\" please bear in mind that I am not throwing you any hints.)The first five minutes of the film sets the mood, perspective, character relationships, general theme of the story and direction of the plot. This first six minutes in itself is a first as far as Hindi film goes. One of the most outstanding features of this film is that it has done away with post production voice dubbing, and has made live on site recording of the dialogues. This is a real change from the unnatural dubbed voice-overs we have grown sick and tired of in Bollywood films. Dialogues are natural and the sound actually blends in with the LA atmosphere. There is also depth and perspective to the sounds. The sounds of police siren wailing away till kingdom come, constantly reminds us that it is really LA. Some real professionals have been put to work on the sound recording. The title sequence in this film is also a welcome change. Something I have never seen in other Hindi movies. Smartly designed urban typography with proper spacing and thematic colours. Music is well chosen. Timing is uniform. Motifs and theme are consistent. simply smashing !!!For once Americans speak the way Americans usually speak as opposed to the usual slowed-down-for-desi-audience-dialogues we usually hear in Indian films. Cinematography of Kaante is simply brilliant. One can see a perfect marriage of editing and photography with sharp cuts, different camera angles and some dramatic perspectives of Los Angeles city. Anamorphic lenses have been cleverly used to show wide angle shots especially during the shots of the LA strip bar. However the use of warm filter has been a bit overdone. Some indoor night shots can be seen in warm tones, which was quite unnecessary. Some nice time lapse sequences and aerial shots can also be seen. This does not mean the photographer goes on a tour of LA city tour, as most Bollywood photographers do while shooting in foreign lands. You also won't see the hero and heroin doing the usual Universal Studios tour in this movie for a change.Kaante is packed with some decent action sequences. Perhaps also a first for a film shot in a foreign country. Money has been well spent on some real American stunt actors playing cops. There is also a tastefully executed strip bar song and dance number with the sexy Malaika Arora. The American cast is excellent.Has Hollywood invaded Bollywood in Kaante? There are real reasons for technical excellence in this film. Apart from the cast, direction and script writers, there is very little Bollywood presence in Kaante. Cinematography, set decoration, special effects, makeup, and almost all of the technicians in this movie are Hollywood hands. Perhaps that's why this film is so different. Sanjay Dutt and Amitabh Bachan have performed their roles faithfully well. New comer Mahesh Manjrekar puts on a commendable performance as the crazed hoodlum. I could resist comparing him to Joe Pesci in Casino while I watched him, :. We hope there is more up his sleeves in the near future. The rest of the six main characters do not share equal number of lines or screen time. There is plenty of wit and humour without trying too hard to be funny. The dialogues are natural. Actors perform effortlessly giving the impression of life. Having said all that. There are drawbacks. The script is too wordy at times. The fast paced action sometimes grind to dreaded speech session. Some minor plot holes and illogical turn of events can be noticed. I mentioned that plot introduction and character building took place during the first 6 minutes of the film. But then the story continues to build relationships even till the end of the film. During the last 1 minute of the movie we are shown some 2nd unit shots of Raj Yadav's sister in an institution. This really has little bearing on the story, and is completely unnecessary. We also learn little about Majors wife and family hence we are unable to share his emotions. Sometimes its best to leave the complex relationship building effort in the first half of a story. It tends to distract the viewer from the story line. There is even a song towards end of the film, which was quite out of place. It seems there is an unwritten law in Bollywood that a film has to be longer than two hours, regardless of whether you have the material. This film would have been lot more exciting, if it was a little shorter. But none of the drawbacks should scare away anyone who wants to see Hindi cinema at the juncture of a major revolution. Kaante will remain an unforgettable and major step in the evolution of Hindi Cinema.\n",

            "If you liked \"Khosla ka Ghosla\", you would surely love this family entertainer. I missed this movie when it was in the theaters but saw it at my friends place. Its a classic Shakespearean plot where everything is a mess until the climax. Acting all around was commendable and everybody portrayed their part as the role demanded. Special mention- The lead lady \"Rhea\" may seem to be a bit challenged in acting but when you think more you will realise that she portrayed the \"bimbo beauty\" role pretty well and that demanded such expressions initially but her character grew as the film proceeds. Frankly speaking, this movie was sure must watch with friends in the cinemas but i missed that opportunity.\n",

            "Golasy is a visually & technically sparse, but interesting experiment. The use of nudity ( all of the characters are nude ) as well as the scenery ( all of the scenes are shot in two drab rooms and a hallway ) serve the purpose of focusing the viewer's attention on the action & dialogue which, while not sparkling, witty or ornate, precisely captures the atmosphere of a single day in a small office in an anonymous Polish bureaucracy.The subtleties of the dialogue will likely be lost on western viewers, but not on other denizens of former soviet satellite countries for whom all of the characters represent archetypes present anywhere a soviet-style bureaucracy was to be found...All of the characters are portrayed not by professional actors but by extras & the idea behind casting/nudity, at least according to the director, was to capture the most honest, primal reactions ( changes of stance, posture, muscle mimicry, color) which are best visible without our clothes.While Golasy is not a ground breaking film by any standard, it is an entertaining & insightful as well as honest look at the human condition\n",

Sushmita is definitely a scene stealer...I loved the scene where the good doctor takes her out to dinner and she dictates her daily activities. The Laga Laga song was also nice. Sushmita Sen is lucky to have such a statuesque and graceful figure. The rivalry of Salman and Sohail was hilarious! Salman's character was a terrible liar. I guess the moral of the story is not to lie because one lie invariably leads to the next until the person is trapped in a web of deceit. The myriad of lies that form the the plot definitely are responsible for the many comical moments. I saw this one in the there with my friend Raaes.

            "The beginning of this movie was actually pretty good; I enjoyed the discussion (albeit brief) of the birth of horror films. It got a bit muddled when it entered the 30's and 40's...I feel like they were trying to make too many political points where none really existed.When it got to the 50's, that's really when the politics overtakes the discussion of the movies. This is partially because most of the directors grew up in or started directing in the 60's and they were all counter-culture types. Normally when you watch a documentary about something, you get a full view, not an utterly biased piece of propaganda...I'm sorry, comparing Ronald Reagan to Freddy Krueger as the scariest person in the 80's? Really??? Most Americans would disagree - I mean other than the staunchest leftists who see Obama as too conservative still hold any sort of vindictiveness for Reagan.If you were looking for a documentary about how these films came into being or where the horror genre has been and where it's going...eh, you'll get a very thin layer of that. The directors they have in here spend way too much time discussing how important their relatively unimportant films were in establishing the political tones (who really looks at horror movies for politics?) and too little time actually discussing American horror films.It would have been nice for them to discuss how British horror films influenced American horror films (Universal competing against Hammer for instance) or how authors like Edgar Allen Poe, Shirley Jackson, and Richard Matheson provided much of the fodder for the horror films in the 50's and 60's...other than a passing mention of Poe, there is no mention of any author other than Stephen King.This is a poor attempt to document the history of the horror film genre. There are plenty of clips from films, but they are far too brief to really enjoy. Too little time is given to too many films for there to be any real depth here. Ironically, there is almost no mention of contemporary horror films that actually are worthwhile...namely independent directors and films that aren't just blood and gorefests. Oh well! Don't bother with this.\n",

Her character is complex and mind blowing, making the movie suspenseful. She proves she can act in any role. Manisha added some sparkle to the movie and helped Kajol's character. Paresh Rawal was the amazing. He usually plays funny roles but this was another side of him. The plot was very thorough and detailed. Everything was laid out piece by piece so there was no time to guess or ponder. The music was melodious and added embellishment to the movie. The climax was heart stopping and filled with goose-bumps. This movie is definitely a must see and I recommended to everyone who likes thriller or suspense.\n",

            "I enjoy the films produced by Yash Raj. It may be the uninhibited romance, the great music, the talented actors, the fine stories, the production values, or the larger-than-life quality attached to many of them. Yeh Dillagi has all of it. It's not a very original film, not a fantastically made one, but very memorable thanks to its own style, its distinct setting, its music and its main star cast. The story of two brothers falling for the same girl without being aware of each other's feelings is extremely typical, but here, it's more than just about that. It's a very fresh story filled with a lot of energy and many exciting, funny and memorable moments. The music of the film is outstanding, and maybe the main reason the film is somehow remembered today. All the songs, without exception, are great. \"Lagi Lagi\", \"Hothon Pe Bas\", \"Dekho Zara Dekho Barsaat\" are my favourite. That said, my favourite aspect is without a doubt the way the camera manages to capture the breathtaking beauty of Shimla and its many picturesque views seen through every window and in every outdoor shot. Really a refreshing change. The script was really quite okay, even with the usual faults, the unnecessary comic subplots and some of Saif's unconvincing affairs with some average-looking girls. Anyway, I liked the way the relationship of two brothers was portrayed, and I appreciated the writers for not going to the extent of creating an unnecessary rivalry between the two.Akshay Kumar and Kajol form a fantastic pair and look very good together. The part where the story takes a turn to portray their interaction and growing affection for each other and the ensuing romance is the film's most beautiful sequence, and it was handled really well. Akshay is one of my favourite actors, and he is impressive in a role that is very different from what people thought he best suited when he entered films (action). I don't know why Yash Raj never made any other films with him after this successful performance. He is restrained, good-looking, charismatic, and during the song \"Dekho Zara\" I noticed how superb he is as a dancer - all the qualities required for this kind of films. As the film's main protagonist, Kajol is charm personified as Sapna. She is appealing, natural and convincing, and it is her character which carries the narrative forward. I think she never looked as sensuous and attractive as she looked in this film. Her attitude, charisma and spunky personality can make anyone fall for her, so no surprises that she is the centre of attention here. Saif Ali Khan is good, but not as good as his costars. His character is very difficult to like in the beginning, and his comic sense did not work as it usually does today. Anyway, Yeh Dillagi is very memorable for me, and maybe it's got to do more with the fact that I've liked it since childhood, so I tend to overlook some of its flaws. I find it as good as several other Yash Raj flicks of that time; not as great as, say, DDLJ, in terms of film-making or story, but still a charming romance and altogether good entertainment.\n",

            "Lallu is a term used in North India to denote a person who is excessively naive or purely stupid in the context of the worldly knowledge. Popular Hindi novelist Ved Prakash Sharma wrote a novel under this title which was a suspense-thriller and published in 1994. Ved Prakash Sharma gave the story of this novel to Bollywood director Umesh Mehra for making a Hindi film on that. Umesh Mehra not only bought the story but also hired the services of Ved Prakash Sharma to write the screenplay and the dialogs of that movie. Popular action hero Akshay Kumar was signed for the lead role. The movie proved to be a box office grosser. It's Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995).Sabse Bada Khiladi (the biggest player) is the story of a simpleton (Akshay Kumar) who calls himself as Lallu. He saves the life of a rich businessman, Jamna Daas (Avtaar Gill) when a truck was about to trample him. Jamna Daas has a motherless daughter, Sunita (Mamta Kulkarni) who has become a brat. A crooked criminal lawyer Amar Singh (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) is planning to usurp the wealth of Jamna Daas by getting his son Amit (Mohnish Behl) married to Sunita. Amit has been successful in trapping Sunita in his fake love. Now the situation is that the self-proclaimed Lallu has himself got injured in his attempt to save the life of Jamna Daas. Out of gratitude, Jamna Daas arranges his medical treatment and also gives him a job in his household. Feeling that Lallu is innocent and clean-heart, Jamna Daas assigns him the responsibility of bringing Sunita on the right track. Since this does not suit the greedy father-son duo, i.e., Amar Singh and Amit; they go after Lallu. A police inspector, Kekda (Gulshan Grover) also becomes a part of this scenario. He is also trying to grind his own axe in the given status of things but he suspects that Lallu is not what he claims to be and his real motive is not just grabbing Jamna Daas' wealth. Now a game of checks and checkmates start between Lallu and his opponents. Finally, the real identity of Lallu as well as his real objective comes to fore and he only emerges as the winner in the end, proving himself to be the biggest player (Sabse Bada Khiladi).While making a Bollywood movie on a good story or a good novel, it is a Herculean task for the filmmaker to do justice to the original work. Why ? Because he has to take care of the commercial considerations and stud the script with regular formulae viz. songs and dances, romance, comedy, fights etc. so that the movie can appeal to the masses habituated of watching such flicks. And in this bid, the original story gets distorted. Exceptionally, sometimes the movie proves to be a better creative work than the novel / story. However on most of such occasions, it's the movie which comes a cropper when compared with the good literary work which is its premise. Sabse Bada Khiladi falls into the latter category. I read the novel first and watched the movie later and concluded without any doubt in my mind that the movie is many notches below the novel. Where the novel is a brilliant suspense-thriller, the movie is a run-of-the-mill Bollywood movie with many things going over the top, diluting the quality of the original story.The novel has been written on a very large canvas which could not be covered in the two and a half hours long movie. But this is one aspect only. The style of narrating itself is faulty in the movie. The novel starts with Lallu's encounter with the benevolent rich man and gradually the story unfolds on layer-by-layer basis, rendering shocks to the reader after every few pages, the movie starts with those events which have been narrated in the novel in flash-back. The flat narration has not allowed the suspense factor to thicken and envelop the audience in the desirable manner. The movie focuses more on romance, (slapstick) comedy, songs and dances and action and less on the mind-games between the protagonist and the antagonists which is the backbone of the novel. Unlike the novel, the movie is devoid of any shock value. The movie is an interesting one, all the same. Those who have not read the novel will find themselves as hooked throughout. Rajesh Roshan's music with the lyrics of Dev Kohli is also a plus point of the movie. Mukkala ... Muqaabla ... and Bholi Bhali Ladki had become chartbusters when the movie was released. If I have to choose the best song, then I will choose Har Dil Mein Hai Rab Basta which is linked to the Lallu avtaar of the hero making the entry. Music is not great but it's appealing and adds value to the movie.Performance wise talking, the director seems to have allowed the actors to act in whatever way they wanted. Character actors - Avtaar Gill and Sudhir Dalvi (playing the role of the doctor of Jamna Daas) only are able to impress. Akshay Kumar has acted according to his action hero image of that period. He had already become famous as Khiladi (player) by that time and this movie consolidated his position in the industry in that form. It's a pity that a fine actor like Mohnish Behl had to overact (perhaps because of the instructions given to him by the director).All in all, Sabse Bada Khiladi is a value for money flick. Definitely a nice timepass. However as said earlier, the novel is much superior to the movie and therefore, while recommending the movie to the typical movie buffs, I advise those who can read Hindi to read the novel Lallu which is a gem from the pen of the famous Hindi novelist Ved Prakash Sharma.\n",

            "Phoolan Devi (played by Seema Biswas) is sold into marriage at 11 and is repeatedly abused from then onwards because she is a woman. She is partially liberated by Vikram Mallah (Nirmal Pandey), one of the bandits she is taken in by and eventually rises to lead the group, extracting vicious revenge on upper-cast men in repayment for what they had done to her.The film is a fascinating account of the life of Phoolan Devi who was assassinated in September 2001. The film follows from rise (if you can call it that) from abused child to Bandit Queen. Scenes of abuse are tactfully portrayed with the focus on Phoolan's face rather than the act itself. This focus allows the viewer to see the pain that is inflicted by the abuse. This is still very hard to sit and watch be it the abuse by her husband at 11 or the gang rape of adulthood. It's sad that worldwide women are treated as second-class citizens, often subject to this type of terrible abuse as a matter of daily life - even sadder that many religions are interpreted to allow it.Where the film is weak is the depiction of the two sets of violence - violence against Phoolan is shown as horrible and unforgivable as it should be, however her acts of retaliation are filmed with a more artistic camera and you get the feeling that we are meant to take it that these acts of violence are less horrible because they are revenge attacks. Many of those killed by Phoolan's gang had not done anything to her and were \"innocent\". The film should have a more even tone across all these actions.The performances are roundly excellent. All characters no matter how repugnant or noble are played as totally believable - for many you see both sides of their characters. Seema Biswas is excellent as Phoolan Devi, she convinces throughout the film. The subject matter must have been very difficult to act through but she is without a flaw in the lead - the only problem being the slightly sympathetic edge towards her acts of revenge that the film gives.The film is horrible viewing and yet inspiring that one woman could survive through such events in such a society. Phoolan lived with things that the vast majority of us will ever imagine, she rose up against amazing odds to marry above her caste and be elected to the Indian Parliament. Worth watching to help you be aware of the rest of the world and to ensure that you keep yourself kind towards others in all situations.Long live Phoolan Devi. May she find more peace in death than she did in life.\n",

            "I am writing this review after watching Fitoor for the second time and I must say that it was better than I remembered!I think that the film's major flaw is due to the audience's Great Expectations:expecting too much from Katrina Kaif and Aditya Roy Kapoor's first on screen appearance together as a couple. expecting the perfect adaptation of a classic novel (come on, it never happens!).Yes, the film does have some issues and valid criticism, but it isn't as bad as people make it seem. I personally would have liked more scenes between Noor and Firdaus (as children and as adults) to strengthen the love story. Perhaps integrating the video from the song \"Pashima\" into the film and developing further the dance routine would have added the edge needed to make the love obsession more believable and overall more gripping.What I particularly appreciated on my second viewing was Firdaus's point of view. Her family background, especially her mother's bad judgment in love, justifies her apparent cold behaviour and calculated decisions. The social difference between the two main characters is evident from the start with Kaif and Kapoor's incredible look alike younger selves. Firdaus's outfits and jewellery give her an aura of perfection and unreachability. Whereas Noor's simple and traditional clothing places him in the lower classes.***SPOILERS***I also liked how the obsessed Noor tries his best to win her over: attains social acclaim with wealth and fortune and tries his utmost to be with her. Yet at the end it is HER searching for him. The two lovers meet; just the two of them. No onlookers, no dancing, no fireworks, no grand speech professing their love. Just the two of them amidst the peacefulness of the Kashmiri snowy landscape in contrast with the chaotic lifestyle of Delhi. The struggle and indecision to be together is finally put to an end with this long awaited reunion.I recommend watching Fitoor as it is, without Great Expectations, and you will enjoy it.\n",

Such is his magical charisma in the film (and in almost all) that I can't resist but start this review of Vasan Bala's second feature, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (The Man Who Feels No Pain) by singing his praises despite it being a masterful work of superb cast performances (including the lead Abhimannyu Dassani and Radhika Madan). He comes second in the silly yet full-of-life plot that narrates the story of Surya (Dassani), a young man born with a life-threatning rare disease which prevents him from feeling any pain, who yearns to push evil off the face of at least his small world. Helping him in his venture are the characters that I am in love with. In addition to Devaiah, Mahesh Manjrekar is the man who helps in making the film more memorable as you end the film humming that one number from the indie, upbeat soundtrack that has stayed with you and reminded you of a time when fun was simply watching a video of your favourite kung-fu hero in a VHS tape at your wealthy friend's house. Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is brilliantly crafted by Bala with some of the best action choreography and music mixing I have seen all year this year. The humour is local, original, and bang-on ROFL material. If you are okay with shedding all threads of realism and watching a film for what it is (ultimate silliness) you will love this action comedy film more than I did. It is made for the generation of cinema consumers who would get it more if I use a certain term, so I will: it's on fleek. TN.(Watched and reviewed at the 20th MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)\n",

Chaos follows. 'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' has an action-packed & hilarious first-hour, the humor is perfect, the action is superb & Shahid's performance keeps you glued on the screen. The Second-Hour gets a bit dragging, especially in the penultimate portions & even the suspense of the main villain, is not effective enough. The finale is over-the-top, but entertaining nonetheless. Santoshi's Screenplay, laced with humor & action works big time in the first-hour, but a shorter & crisper second-hour was needed. Though never boring, the pace does dip in the second-hour, which acts as its only deterrent. A special mention for the funny dialogue, again written by Santoshi himself. Santoshi's Direction is well-done. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design are good. Action-Sequences are superb. Music by Pritam is energetic.Performance-Wise: Shahid is terrific from start to end. He enacts the comic, emotional as well as the action-sequences faultlessly. This is his best performance since Kaminey. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Its great to see veteran actress Padmini Kolhapure after a hiatus. She's excellent. Darshan Jariwala scores. Sanjay Mishra's impeccable comic timing continues to mesmerize.

He single handedly makes this film work!'Commando' Synopsis: A condemned Commando protects an innocent girl from a feared politician. 'Commando' is the same old story of the Good versus the Bad. Its been witnessed on the screen umpteen times, but what makes 'Commando' worth watching, is the Raw & Brutal Action it offers. The Action is amongst the best I've seen in a long, long time. The Screenplay clearly highlights Action. Dilip Ghosh's Direction is atmospheric, while the Cinematography captures the wildness accurately. Performance-Wise: Jamwal steals 'Commando'. He's highly efficient in the Action-Scenes! Pooja Chopra looks sweet & delivers a very confident performance. Jaideep Ahlawat plays the twisted antagonist, most convincingly. Darshan Jariwala is adequate.On the whole, 'Commando' shouldn't be missed by the Fanboys of Action-Orinted Cinema.\n",

            "Sooraj the young whiz-kid came with a big bang with Maine Pyaar Kiya followed by biggest blockbuster Hum Aapke Hain Koun. Subsequently keeping the tradition of Rajshree Film came up with multi-starrer Hum Saath-Saath Hain. When the latter didn't fare well at the box-office, Sooraj decided to catch up with times and make a contemporary movie of today, doing away with strong values the Rajshris used to uphold upon. In the process a major overhaul was done - for instance Anu Mallik steps into the shoes of Raam-Laxman and foreign locales chosen to film major portions of the movie in the garb of some Indian village.The story itself is a re-hash of Rajshri's Chit-Chor with the latest ingredients and new masala's added.How-ever the movie sticks to Sooraj's movie length of over 3 hours and makes you wince in pain. The story is so very predictable from the word go.Valentine sequence was a big drag. Comedy sequences didn't evoke enough mirth. The animated bird was almost anything but stupid.Kareena was doing extension of Poo's character. Hritik tried to give his best to live to the character of energetic blabbering guy. Abhishek gave a restrained performance which was good in comparison to others. A few songs were okay.Sooraj needs to re-think as to where he has faltered big time. Avoid at all costs even if you are a big fan of Rajshri movies, Hritik, Kareena or Abhishek.\n",

            "The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident which made her miscarry a previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. This element of the film is not very realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? I guess the writers have not heard of artificial insemination, but I guess if they had, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.This is generally a nice film, with a good story, good actors and great songs. The big family thing is evidently a take off on Hum Aapke Hain Koun, which is not a bad film, since audiences must love this concept. The cinematography is quite bad, and so is the lack of originality in the script. One of its weakest points, as a matter of fact, is the annoying chain of sequences lifted straight off Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? Salman plays the lead pretty well. It's nice to see him take a serious character for once, although he tends to underplay it as tad too much. Moreover, the cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman were really unnecessary. Come on, it's cheesy and redundant. Rani is just about OK; she is generally effective and does try to somehow enhance an otherwise poorly written part, but she gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta.And indeed, the film belongs to Preity Zinta, who steals the show with a flawless performance. Even within a less credible film, she makes the transformation from the loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film, emotes and makes you wish for her character's best interest, partly because of the role itself, and partly because of Zinta's magnetic and positive personality. This performance is easily the main reason to watch the film.The film's ending only highlights Zinta's position as the star of the show, and the directors probably realized right through the process that focus should be placed entirely on her character. Watch Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Preity Zinta. My high rating is easily for her sincere and moving performance.\n",

            "Vipul Shah once again returns with his uniform Punjabi flavour & the India-London theme. Taking another step ahead of his \"Namaste London\", this time he impressively comes up with a good take on pop singers and the back stage drama in their over famous lives. But in an otherwise well directed, intense and emotional drama, he is sadly not accompanied by an equally enjoyable musical score (as in Namaste London), which was much needed by the subject and its script. So minus the songs and uninspiring music, here we have a well directed movie with some entertaining & enlightening moments and a worth watching climax (again subtracting the last song).With a story about changing relationships between two childhood friends, \"London Dreams\" starts with a notable opening dialogue from Ajay Devgan and then moves into the flashback of the same overused fields of Punjab. After a few introductory scenes, a song and 20 minutes into the movie, enters Salman Khan, who simply sets the screen on fire with his superb effortless acting and hilarious comic timing. From here on the film takes off in actual terms giving way to a brilliant in-flight sequence where Salman interacts with the passengers, an airhostess and the security men in his own impeccable style. And then the first half ends with a well conceived on-stage sequence, which successfully excites you enough to see the rest of it.Post interval the narration moves into more serious matters, showcasing the cut-throat competition between artists, the feeling of jealousy among themselves and the evil games they play to taste success in their professional lives. The emotional conflict between Ajay and Salman further leads to a completely unexpected and splendidly conceived climax which gives new meaning to the spirit of friendship between two artists and childhood friends. In fact the climax sequence of Salman and Ajay at the Railway Station rightly deserves to be applauded for its superb writing and enlightening execution. Salman straight away wins the heart of every single viewer in the theater, coming up with a completely unimaginable solution to the problem existing between the two friends and gives a new meaning to the \"Art of Forgiving\". But a whole song after their re-union was not creative or intelligent from any angle and the movie should have ended right at the Railway Station.Performance wise Salman comes at the top with a great act, which includes comedy, emotion, tragedy and even trauma of a drug addict. Ajay Devgan gives another intense and explosive performance different from his current famous comedy movies. He looks dashing in his rough performer getup, but lacks the youthfulness and body flexibility of a rock artist. In other words, he seems to be quite stiff in his stage acts and moreover his self torture scenes were also not needed at all. They give you the feeling of Deja vu, like the one seen in Amitabh's \"Mahaan\". Asin is breath-taking gorgeous and looks much better than \"Ghajini\". Her short Sita-Gita act was enjoyable only because she looked equally beautiful in both kind of dresses.Om Puri is cool and calm in his few scenes and notable dialogues but Ranvijay Singh gives an OK performance in his debut movie. He looked more confident in his \"Roadies\" act on the small screen. Aditya Roy Kapur, as Ranvijay's brother is impressive & Brinda Parekh repeats her act of \"Corporate\".It can be said that director Vipul Shah is back with a commendable effort talking about the ugly side of human characters who happen to be stage artists in the current script. But the theme is equally relevant in any business form in this cunning monetary world. Vipul realistically directs few praiseworthy sequences in the movie like the one where Salman transforms two lines of a song in different kind of compositions having different tastes and the worth watching emotional climax scene at the railway station. However, along with these well directed ones, he also delivers a questionable sequence, when all the four members of the band except Ajay freely move out of the Wembley Stadium's green rooms to the lonely, dark backyards, breaking all the security circles, on the very night of their much awaited performance.Unfortunately, Vipul majorly faulted on his choice of compositions for a project which entirely talks about a musical band and its members. For such a script based on music itself, the songs and score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is too feeble to get register.In fact the most important song of the movie, which the band plays at their night in the Wembley Stadium, is completely uninspiring and boring. On the other hand the cinematography captures the essence of the subject superbly. The stage sequences and the Wembley have been shot real well along with some great computer graphics.Conversely, I wondered that if a project is around Punjab and also requires a great amount of Punjabi language, music and feel to be incorporated into it, then why not they hire some actual Punjabi Professionals for the job, who can rightly guide them about the Punjabi dialogues, their pronunciations and the Punjabi melodies in the songs. For instance, Salman keeps on calling Ajay as \"Bhara\" which means brother, with a faulty pronunciation.Summing up, I would like to say the \"London Dreams\" just missed out to become a masterpiece flick based on a good subject. It is Salman's movie all the way, who will appeal to everyone from a city professional to a village farmer. Besides him, the movie and its theme will also appeal to wannabe artists from the younger generation. But it cannot be called a finely polished product as it has many unwanted songs and scenes which could have been easily edited out. And I wish it had some good melodious songs which would have taken the brilliant performances in the movie to another level altogether.\n",

Sex comedies are fine as far as they make you laugh, but in here utter silliness is all there is.It is disheartening to see good actors like Aftab Shivdasani resorting to mindless boilers like this which may entice crooked people, but is only a disgusting roll of celluloid that is murkier than a toilet seat.BOTTOM LINE: Umesh Ghadge's Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3 is a must miss.

It was nice to watch the film, as an entertainer, and there are some funny scenes. But the film does not have some novel script which can capture you.Salman makes his part very well. As an actor whose mission in this film is to make people laugh, he knows how to combine this aspect with some emotional expressions, such as that when Preity informs him about the new car the family gifted him, and he feels offended about that.Preity is very beautiful and there is something irresistible about her on-screen. The role may not have required histrionics from her, but she does her job effectively.Mukherjee gets very little scope and doesn't make any impact. The first three quarters feature her lying on bed, and the remaining one introduces her as a good human being and caring sister, too typical and boring.Watch it if you are a fan of Salman, Preity and to some extent Rani, and want to have some good two-three hours, but don't watch it if you expect to see a good, or even an average film. 4/10.\n",

            "I watched Break Ke Baad without expectations and it neither surprised nor disappointed me. It was quite a watchable movie but way too ordinary to be memorable. The film follows the relationship of Abhay and Aaliya, their love, friendship and differences. At times the movie manages to work with its light nature and looks quite believable and fun, but at others it's also too subtle for the story it tells and lacks the power to convince and captivate. The story is very simple, and it could have been more interesting had the direction and the script been better handled. Here, the narrative style is a bit dark and plain, and it often seems like it was taken too seriously by the makers, which is odd considering the fact that it does not really have much substance. The film's music is quite okay although, like the film, it is nothing particularly special. The main lead Imran Khan and Deepika Padukone are well cast, and frankly enough they are not really challenged by some great roles to begin with, so don't expect much. Imran is okay. Deepika is better in a performance that is pretty nice and more impressive than his but never particularly impressive in and of itself. She is undeniably pretty and attractive and something about her in this film works and may improve her prospects in the film industry, but she is far from being a glowing talent (like Anushka Sharma, for example). To sum it up, Break Ke Baad is overall an ordinary feature which does have its moments but after all can be watched only once, at least according to me.\n",

            "The foremost hurdle in a film like SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER is its title itself which reveals the actual plot of the film right away and you very well know what they are precisely going to show as far as story-plot is concerned. So, it all comes down to the treatment, presentation and performances in such a venture, which fortunately is also the forte of its director Tigmanshu Dhulia, who has earlier given us films such as HAASIL, CHARAS and also PAAN SINGH TOMAR, which is soon going to release in the coming months.Right from his first film (and before that in the T.V. Serials too), the characterizations in Tigmanshu's script have always been well written, brilliantly executed and superbly performed by the cast without any exceptions. And same is the case with his latest SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER too, which also has fabulous performances from almost everyone featuring in the film, which remains the biggest reason why it deserves to be seen at least once by everyone appreciating such innovative kind of cinema.No doubt the story and its key characters have been taken from the cult Guru Dutt classic SAHIB BIWI AUR GHULAM. But Tigmanshu molds this basic theme into a more bitter, mean and bloody format, full of love, greed and betrayals. As the story moves further revealing the dark side of it's every key person in the script, the actors start growing on you with their impressive acts and keep you engaged. Here apart from its lead performers, a special mention needs to be made for the attention given by the director to his supporting cast such as Vipin Sharma who is superb in his portrayal of the rival don and I seriously wished he had a longer role written in the script with more of his entertaining one liners. Also Deepraj Rana as Jimmy's trustworthy, Deepal Shaw (as Deepraj's daughter), Rajeev Gupta (as minister) and Shreya Narayan (as the mistress) leave their own mark in the overall impact of the film.In the lead acts, Mahie Gill scores the maximum in the complex role of a unsatisfied, neglected married woman, who is also a psychic patient. She is simply excellent as the BIWI and once again shows the powerhouse of talent hidden in her as an actress. Randeep Hooda as the GANGSTER surprises you with a very cool and underplayed kind of performance as required by its script. But I found Jimmy Gill, though effective but also repeating himself in that tough mood, playing the SAHEB.In short, SBAG is a film to be applauded only for its performance and impactful dialogues delivered effectively by its entire cast ensemble. But unfortunately, after his last SHAGIRD, it again cannot be included in the list of best efforts put in by its director, TIGMANSHU DHULIA. The man surely is capable of coming up with a much better product in terms of entertainment and value for money as seen in his most famous product till date, HAASIL.In his present offering SBAG, indisputably the performances are great, the dialogues are sharp and the cinematography is perfect, but still I felt the entertainment factor missing in the film somehow. Though in the first half its all enjoyable as you witness the new relationship forming within the characters, with a bit of skin show and the sudden twists and turns unfolding on the screen. But later on, the pace starts dipping, the sequences start repeating and certain questions are left unanswered which eventually go against the movie in the end. Moreover, the climax also leaves you confused with more deaths happening than survivals in the storyline.However, a worth mentioning merit of the film has to be its soundtrack with few great numbers including the peppy \"Jugni\" and the sad \"Akhiyan Ton Bhul Hoyi\" sung by Arif Lohar in his own incomparable style. And I really loved watching the short version of the song on screen with the gorgeous looking Mahie.Conclusively, whereas a certain section of viewers would surely enjoy the film due to its above mentioned merits, majority of them may complain the lack of entertainment factor in it. Still I would recommend it to the viewers who are familiar with the earlier works of the director and can appreciate innovative scripts (taking forward the characters taken from a cult classic). Perhaps I was expecting a lot more from one of my favorite directors.\n",

Fans as well as those who have never seen his films before will doubtless enjoy his charismatic performance. He shows sensitivity and strength in his portrayal of Aditya, a man who finds himself more and more captivated by the fragile and determined Jia portrayed by the beautiful Katrina Kaif. The problem is that both of them are engaged to be married to someone else. Shot on location in Calgary, Canada, the feel of the movie is very Western in many ways with a good amount of English dialogue sprinkled here and there. The music and dances perfectly compliment the budding love story and incorporate both Western and Indian dance. The colorful supporting cast starting with Aditya's fiancée, Sonia (the alluring Bipasha Basu) make the story more realistic by adding a familial dimension to it. The movie asks an important question. Will family traditions be honored or will love prevail? The answer to that question is to be found in this gem of a Bollywood movie which will show us that love is what truly connects us all.\n",

            "Taking forward the new genre of \"Youthful Movies\" in Bollywood, here is a film which is a delightful watch with some sparkling performances full of energy and style. Intelligently made within a short duration of around 100 minutes, the film starts off in flying colours justifying its trendy name in a spirited style and then keeps on entertaining you mostly till the end. The Facebook generation should appreciate the attempt as it is just made for them specifically and captures the young mindset almost perfectly.The production house has planned its project well with an all fresh talented star-cast, a debutant but famous music director and a small budget film shot in its limited locations. The dialogues are sharp and entertaining, the sequences are pretty engaging and momentum keeps on going with very few dipping scenes (in its second half). Actually what really works in the film is the chemistry between its four key characters which never becomes heavy or goes over the top. So the film is quite balanced in that direction.Both Saqib Saleem (Vishal) & Saba Azad (Preity), excel in their respective characters and win your heart straight away. In fact Preity earlier also impressed a lot in her short cameo in DIL KABADDI. Nishant Dahiya (Rahul) & Tara D'Souza (Malvika) support them superbly with their good looks and keep the spirit alive. The actors playing the naughty friends of Saqib successfully bring few laughs in the theater especially in the opening sequence inspired from the famous American PIE series of the West.Musically, the film gets an energetic score from Raghu Dixit, with songs looking fine while you are watching them but still I felt their melody part could have been better. Overall the film gives you a good time in the theater mainly because of its performances and strictly not anything else.But here is my \"Million Dollar Question\" to the director Nupur Asthana and the writers of the film : \"When everything was so perfectly and easily available to you right at your doorstep, then Why on earth did you choose such a rotten an overused story-plot for your film, which the viewers have already seen so many times before on the screen?\"Speaking the truth, the makers very ridiculously choose the same old plot of disguised identities over the net in their film, reminding you of 'YOU'VE GOT MAIL' and many other similar movies in which the lead couple keeps chatting with each other on a site, posing as someone else. Regrettably this becomes the main drawback of the film making it entirely predictable right from the introduction of the Social Networking Site, FACEBOOK in one of its initial scenes. But luckily the execution of the plot and the talented bunch of actors save the film from being just another version of the ages old plot and the viewers keep on enjoying it despite the fact that they already know, what's going to happen next.However the fact remains that if only the makers had thought of a new & unexplored plot for their present well directed attempt then it could have been a big HIT of the season indisputably. Yet, do watch it if you are young or young at heart and love the Facebook mania, currently the in-thing all over the world.\n",

I never really intended to see it when I heard about it because Katrina Kaif is in it and all of her films suck (except Race). But the promos was so good and I loved the music especially the Dost song composed by the best music composer & lyrics writer combo A R Rehman and Gulzar. So I seen it anyway and its about Yuvvraaj (Prince) who gets thrown out of his family. He wants to get married to this really rich girl but her father wants her to marry someone else. So he signs a contract with him that in 40 days, he will become twice as rich as him. He eventually gets closer to one of his brothers and realises that he is happy to help him without wanting anything.The story & screenplay is o.k. but it's quite long for a 2.5 hour movie because their wasn't enough to make it that long. None of the actors acted well except Anil Kapoor and Katrina Kaif was simply the worst, she is completely crap. Neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. I do not like her one bit and if she was replaced by someone else then that would've helped a lot. The film had big sets that were so good and visually impressive that they keep you in your seat throughout. Overall if you have nothing to do on a rainy day or something then watch it but Yuvvraaj is nothing to look forward to.\n",

His Fanaa was a novel idea gone haywire in the second half. His Thoda Pyar Thoda Magic was well, a joke. After 4 years, Kohli brings us another romance and he once again, doesn't fail to disappoint.The whole concept of T.M.K. is interesting and nobody can deny that. In fact, had the writing been in place - it would have been genius. However, T.M.K. is sadly nothing more than 3 predictable love stories in one 2 and a half hour flick.In 1960, a growing India with a growing film industry has a musician named Govind who has a dream to make it big in Bombay. There he meets film-star Ruksaar and then starts their .In 2012, Krissh has just had a break up with his girlfriend on his birthday. That same night, he meets Radha, a up to date girl. Then starts their .Now back to 1910, British ruled India. Javed is a charming womanizer who meets a girl who just doesn't get wooed by his antics. A sardarni by the name of Aradhna. Javed falls in love and there starts their .Now all 3 stories start out with a bang but fiddle down very easily. Also, the misunderstandings in the movie are so dumb. Especially for the story in 1960 and 2012. To me, the best story is in 1910 but even that story isn't extraordinary.The climax is rushed and there is no doubt. It's as if the writers don't know where to go now and just give up on the script.The writing is sore. Kunal Kohli's shayari is very good, however. That is about it!! Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra save the film from being complete trash. Shahid is excellent in all avtaars. Of Course it's most fun to watch him as Javed. Priyanka looks amazing and acts well too. It isn't the best act from the 2, but good indeed.Now to director Kunal Kohli. I don't hate or love the guy. I do feel that one major thing that has hurt most of his films (except Hum Tum) is the predictability level. His films don't have the X Factor. Even here, where there is a great idea in place - the boring writing messes things up. His direction is good but he fails in choosing the right screenplay.Overall, a very bland and tasteless romance with very few moments that amaze the viewer. Dasappointing.\n",

            "Ishq Vishk is \"Archie/Betty/Veronica\" in Bollywood. The story is pretty stale and has been made practically in each decade since the inception of Bollywood. How-ever Ishq Vishk is the movie for current decade - set in contemporary times with fresh approach relevant to todays world and portrayed using new faces, which is what makes the movie click.How Shahid Kapoor drops the cute-next-door-girl, Amrita Rao for hot-girl with an attitude Shehnaz. The rest of the movie is the journey of our hero's realisation and return to the true love.The movie is draped with melodious hummable songs, dances, funny comic scenes, teenagish one-liners. The movie is targetted towards teenagers and the director does not falter in this aspect. This movie is perfect debut vehicle for Shahid Kapoor. His has what it takes to be. Perfect body, good dancing skills and firm dialog delivery (though reminds me of Javed Jaffery's voice at times!). Amrita Rao plays the innocent girl convincingly and walking away with audience's compassion. Shehnaz Tresurywalla is just-okay types. Satish Shah and Neelima Azeem (Shahid Kapur's real-life Mom) provide good support. Both the actor and director are to watch out for.\n",

It is a nonsensical crime drama which doesn't have any story at all and the climax is horrible. No entertainment whatsoever in the entire movie. It is one of the worst movies I watched in theatres.\n",

            "When two diverse personalities such as Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj (along with Gulzar) join hands together to produce a horror film based on 'Witchcraft', then its got to be something out of the ordinary and special. Thankfully EK THI DAAYAN largely passes this expectations test as far as the novelty factor is concerned. Yet it falls short of being a thoroughly enjoyable entertainer due to an uninspiring finale, ruining the fine build up & suspense element continuing in its second half.Beginning on a shaky note, the film soon starts delivering some well directed, stunning sequences once the flashback is there with two innocent kids portraying their characters superbly. The child actors particularly the boy, Vishesh Tiwari, keep you hooked on to the screen till the intermission and one feels like witnessing a fairly engaging tale with something new to offer, talking about witches & magic instead of ugly ghosts and cruel betrayals. Post interval the grown-ups take up from the innocent performers like a relay race and continue coming up with some fresh interesting insertions like Kalki. But sadly as it all starts heading towards the end, ETD fails to raise the bar further and finishes on the same familiar notes without making any kind of shocking impact on the viewer as seen in its first half.In straight words, ETD is one of those films which both starts and ends on a sour note but surely has got the content which is much ahead then all those clichéd Vikram Bhatt horror films, repeatedly made for a certain section of viewers, quite regularly. In fact this is not a horror film in the typical sense but a fine script based on a 'Supernatural Theme' related with witches coming back after decades in a leap year to strengthen their individual powers. Therefore as its first merit, you have a new subject here in an Indian mainstream film which can easily be rated as one of the most original ones tried rarely in Hindi cinema till date. Incidentally one might recall MAKDEE, which was again a Vishal Bhardwaj (Children) film released in 2002 revolving around the myth spread among the villagers about a scary mansion. But since Vishal is the producer here in ETD too, so it clearly suggests that the talented soul does have a personal liking towards this unusual subject of witches for sure.The second highlight of the film remains its performances wherein the 3 ladies score the most after the child actors. Konkona Sen Sharma excels in the first half and Huma Qureshi does the same in the second. Kalki Koechlin plays her short role well post interval and Emraan Hashmi is just fine playing the common male related to all the three. Though he doesn't get much scope to show his skills here, but his choice of scripts strongly indicates that he has now rightly understood the importance of new subjects very well. Supporting him, Rajatava Dutta as the doctor impresses andPavan Malhotra once again showcases his underrated talent playing the unaware father.Music in a Vishal-Gulzar film has to live up to its reputation and that's exactly what can be said about the songs of ETD too. Though as usual the tracks are all forcibly inserted into the narration, still one enjoys watching \"Kaali Kaali\" (for the romance) and \"Totey Ud Gaye\" (for the dance) providing the casual relief moments. However \"Yaaram\", despite being good, hinders the pace of the movie, which could have been avoided. The DOP tries to maintain the mood of the film throughout, mixing the dark frames with the lighted ones. But in the process makes it mostly dark which becomes annoying at times. Background score deserves a special mention here for its innovative tones but the same words cannot be used for its special effects department, sadly.In all ETD mainly impresses due to its inventive & original subject, adapted by the debutant director Kannan Iyer, who confidently proves that he has got the talent to deliver a perfect entertainer soon. The film steps on to the next level with its enjoyable performances & screenplay but could have been a real killer with a different culmination providing the missing shock. Its final moments did remind me of a scary masterpiece ROSEMAY'S BABY directed by Roman Polanski in the late sixties. And with a more imaginative climax it surely could have become an attempt to be the ROSEMARY's BABY of Indian Cinema, arguably.\n",

            "This is indeed an excellent indian version of It Happened One Night, the classic with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert both of whom were about 6 inches (or nearly) taller than our Bollywood counterparts. The story has been indianized very well. The lead actors played by Aamir Khan and Pooja Bhatt provide a refreshing change from all the fatty and middle aged ones we have seen so many times in Indian movies of yester years. Aamir has done an excellent job as a smart mouthed reporter so much so the role looks tailor-made for him. Pooja Bhatt is always good in her dad's movies. Her hairstyle became a rave among teens of the nineties. Many twists and turns are provided in the story line to keep the indian audience seated for 3hrs. With good songs thrown in from time to time...it does the job. Check out 'Adhayen bhi hai', the fishermen song, the title song, 'Mainu ishq da lagiya rog', 'Dulhan tu dulha main ban jaonga', 'Tu pyar hai kisi aur ka' and above all 'O mere sapnon ke saudagar'. Deepak Tijori is good in cameo. Although the plot is already-seen, already-known many many times in many many movies (both Western and Indian), Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin is refreshing and is a must-watch for the whole family.\n",

            "Wonderful performances and some crackling dialogs, made this worth a watch.Marriage is a beautiful alliance if the couple understand each other. It will be a nightmare, if they fail to do so. But more or less, it's an alliance filled of compromises and lies at times. Lies can be said to keep the spouse happy too. But at what cost, is a terrible question. The consequences are mostly dreadful at times even practically. This movie is about an alliance of Love and Lies. Farhan Akhtar is man with tons of talent and his acting talent and his coming come use in a great deal in this film. Vidya Balan has been one of the finest actress in recent years and she plays her role as a wife and mother wonderfully. Between the two, their chemistry is great, and they seem to slide well into their roles. Aa script about a typical after marriage life, having baby, and trying to run away from responsibilities, learning from mistakes and forgiving each other would have been nonsensical if it did not have some great dialogs, which should make the stereotypes as fun but not as caricatures. that's what precisely happened in this well written script by Saket Chaudhary. From being together and have fun in early years of marriage, to changing anatomy through pregnancy, while the man becomes more responsible towards the family, and even earns more for them. This is all a clichéd tale that every family goes through. The parent teacher meetings, the birthday parties of the kid's friends, they are all part and parcel of life. Now, those are made interesting by some good writing and fine acting. Together, the team has done a wonderful job in taking the script to a respectable level. The execution through cinematography is wonderful too. Though, editing seems to have disappointed in second half by dragging on some very dramatic moments, which would have been better chopped off. To Farhan and Vidya alone, this film is worth. Also there are wonderful performances by others including Vir Das and Ram Kapoor among many others.A 3/5 would be apt in a film that's hilarious right through the first half, and a kind of drama in the second half. Yet, its fun all through.\n",

            "Kahalid Mohamed's Fiza is one gem of a movie. This is a realistic portrayal of the consequences of war, violence, hatred, and the dehumanisation of people at times of a war. Families losing people, parents losing sons, sisters losing brothers and so on. This film is about Fiza, a smart, intelligent and strong young Muslim woman who lost her brother Aman seven years ago during the 1993 Mumbai riots. He disappeared and no one knows where he is. Meanwhile, she and her suffering mother live a poor and ordinary lifestyle. Fiza decides to go in search of her brother and is well determined to find him by any means possible. She meets different people on her way and finally meets her brother, just to find out that he is not the simple young man he used to be.The film is brilliantly narrated, well pictured, and quite authentically portrayed and acted, so I believe most people will find it easy to relate to the story, to the characters and their different tribulations. The dialogues are well-written and they often waver between the realistic and the utterly theatrical, but that is really a nice sort of balance as far as I'm concerned. The people Fiza meets on her way represent the variety of people in our society: the bad, the good, the deceived, the corrupted, the ugly and the generous. The story changes drastically when Aman enters the picture, it becomes lighter and does lend some relief after the more intense first half. But it's just for a little while. The film soon becomes far more dramatic and intense with some shocking twists. Some of the proceedings are heart-breaking and powerful.Karisma Kapoor delivers one of the finest performances the Hindi screen has seen. What a magnificent performance. She is natural, sincere, beautiful, charismatic, charming, and performs with great nerve, depth and conviction in every frame. She makes the feisty Fiza an unforgettable woman. One particular scene that must be noted is the one in which Fiza breaks down and starts literally mourning post a very tragic incident (see the film to understand). It is an extremely powerful and heart-rending moment of real pain and despair.Jaya Bachchan, in one of her best performances, is amazingly compelling and moving as the hurt yet vivacious and lively Nishatbi. She displays maternal pain and later helplessness and despair with amazing depth and pathos. Her silence, as one can expect from an actress as skilled as she is, tugs at the heartstrings. Hrithik Roshan is impressively competent. His role is very complex and he plays it with complete dedication even if sometimes something is missing and it feels too starry. It's a very good performance overall, though he obviously does not create the same kind of impact as his female co-stars. Other cast members, including Asha Sachdev, Manoj Bajpai and Neha, support very well. Asha Sachdev in particular stands out in a relatively small role. She provides great comic relief with her natural sense of humour. There is also a funny sequence with Johnny Lever imitating different Indian stars.The music is fantastic and helps to relieve the otherwise extremely serious proceedings. Sushmita Sen's number \"Mehboob Mere\" was effective, but the one I liked the most is Karisma's \"Aankh Milaoongi\" dance number. She danced very well and I found the number quite alluring despite its evident irrelevance within this film. \"Aaja Mahiya\" and \"Tu Fiza Hai\" are very melodious and romantic.Khalid Mohammed, a well-known film critic, must have stored the idea for a real and artistic film for a long time. His attempts to draw balance between the mainstream and the so-called art cinema within this film, are a little weird at times but still, this is a wonderfully made film in all aspects. It is authentic, not one-sided, it conveys emotion, fun, entertainment, tears, pain, without going to any extremes of unnecessary drama. The story is interesting and, combined with the good acting, manages to keep the audience, and I'm speaking for myself, constantly engaged. The cinematography is fantastic, the action is not overdone (okay maybe just sometimes), and the background score is exceptional. The ending is shocking but contributes to the drama. This film is highly recommended for all those who love Bollywood films, or realistic films, or just films that make sense.\n",

A Twisted, Violent & Nail-Biting Film, that is sure to meet with critical & commercial success. 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is about The Royal Scandal, where the war for power & prestige continues.'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is stronger & cruder than its prequel. I loved the entire story, its so relentless & unforgiving. Dhulia & Sanjay Chauhan's Screenplay is Twisted, Violent & Nail-Biting! The characters are fabulously written & their actions unfold magnetically. Also, the twists and turns in the narrative are marvelous. Dhulia's Direction is powerful. He dominates every frame with detailing. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is proper. Art & Costume Design, are super. Music by Sandeep Chowta is decent.Performance-Wise: Jimmy Shergill is fantastic. Such control & conviction in a performance is a rarity. Irrfan is spectacular, yet again. Mahie Gill is award-worthy. She plays a complicated part with effortless ease. Soha Ali Khan is at her very best in here. Raj Babbar is incredible in a strong supporting role. Deepraj Rana is effective.

Army housing scam in Mumbai.. a so called witness holed up in Paharganj, Delhi. So to expose the scam, he could have been made to blurt everything out in front of the TV cameras? So from where did Czech arms come in, as also an arms dealer from London, an elite assassin commando Unit of the Indian army (with a James Bond license to kill), a member of the Unit who goes rogue.. what was all this? And was Nasiruddin's blabber so vital that the scam fell through? What a waste of time and what a waste of good actors, especially Manoj, Siddharth, Anupam Kher and Nasiruddin. Could not understand the London connection at all ... also could not understand why Siddharth was hobnobbing with the British MI6. The latter were pretty tame... LOL.

            "I'm constantly amazed at how negative and hostile some reviewers are when a film is happy and lighthearted. It's as if these angry, miserable people can't stand seeing other people have fun.Dil Bole Hadippa is one of my favorite Bollywood films precisely because it doesn't take itself seriously. While Rohan, played by Shahid Kapoor, was a bit melodramatic as the hunky cricket captain, I think it was a perfect \"straightman\" act for a zany comedy.Meanwhile, Rani Mukherjee (Veera/Veer) was hilarious and brilliant as the tiny yet talented all-rounder bats(wo)man with big dreams. She did a wonderful job dancing and singing both as a man in the \"Lions of Punjab\" number, and as a beautiful woman in the other songs.One of the other reviewers compared this film to She's The Man, and although the theme is similar, the Indian version has its own unique charms. So what if it's been done before? How many times do we keep seeing new versions of Pride and Prejudice or some other \"classic\" story? This film tackled some important themes such as giving women a chance to fulfill their dreams even when it hasn't previously been a traditional role. Another significant theme is how your dedication to, and faith in the Divine can manifest in realizing your dreams. And lastly, the most important theme of love - for family, for one's heritage, and for your true love makes Dil Bole Hadippa a film worth watching again and again. Hadippa!\n",

            "Tigmanshu Dhulia started it with 'Haasil' on the backdrop of Uttar Pradesh dirty politics. \"Haasil\" explored the rural India, leaving the chiffon cinema aside; it showed that that there is real and earthy world beyond the picturesque imageries. He has been consistently trying to give us a taste of unsophisticated and practical realm.Tigmanshu's first masala film 'Bullett Raja' have same flavor but the effort is mediocre here, mainly due to abrupt editing, loose screenplay and forced songs sequences.We again witness earthy, rugged and edgy portions which are far from urban and looked truly rural.\"Bullett Raja\" is about of two youngsters, Raja Mishra (Saif Ali Khan) and Rudra Tripathi (Jimmy Shergil) who engulfed themselves in the lands of dirty politics of Uttar Pradesh. They rise like heroes and on the flip side it deteriorates they tranquil lives.Story is merely a revenge drama, but, the writing doesn't hold as the movie progresses. The screenplay is abrupt and flat. The best bit are the action sequences, it separates from the contemporary movies where we can see everything flying with no role of gravity. The action scenes looked really authentic with bullet firing in every 5 minutes. The love track was rushed and abrupt. The other thing which works here are the edgy and fabulous dialogs as always. It has now become the trademark of Dhulia. The climax is predictable; you will probably understand every nuance which the writer tried to reveal at the very end.The film consists a good start cast (mostly Dhulia's favorite) and peculiar dialogs. Music by Sajid-Wajid is really forgettable as songs do not add anything.Saif Ali Khan does a wonderful act here, carrying the entire film. He character is very well written. Jimmy Sheirgill is always good and does a fabulous job here. Sonakshi Sinha is common in all the movies now a days and she does the same thing, once again.Bullett Raja delivers only in parts.

            "When it comes to Indian films then making a Sex Comedy is still quite a difficult task due to the dual mindset prevalent in our society. Here at one end the 'generation now' can see just anything on their electronic gadgets at their will and on the other we are still forced to make & see films which are supposed to be Sex Comedies, without any sex in the real sense due to the strict censors ready with their scissors.As a result, what you really get to see in KYAA SUPER KOOL HAIN HUM is a collage of suggestive scenes and double meaning dialogues where one wants to say the exact words, wishes to show some sexual content but cannot do so due to the Censor Board. In other words, the process of making films under this genre in our part of the world is just like studying the subject of PHYSICS or CHEMISTRY without having the permission to use the LABAROTARIES. Further, it all really seems to be utterly childish if you are an avid fan of Western or World Cinema and have seen some famous movies made in this particular genre.So KSKHH can easily be called a desperate or forcible effort (made within the fixed framework of some strange restrictions and limitations), which tries its best to make you laugh occasionally. The funny moments are there in bits & parts, but that too only in its second half where the film picks up for a few minutes and then slides down again. The enjoyable scenes in the film are so hard to find that one cannot really call it a great attempt at all. The first half fails to make any kind of impact on the viewers in absence of an exciting script as compared to its unrelated \"Kya Kool Hain Hum\"released in 2005. Plus after making a decent start post intermission, the narration suddenly starts dragging due to its over-length, avoidable songs and a completely hushed up, pathetic climax. Hence if you are expecting a great laugh riot made on the lines of its Part One, then you are sure going to be disappointed hugely.Honestly speaking, its really a difficult task to make the viewers enjoy a Sex-Comedy supported only by its double meaning dialogues (using the mute button at times), a few comic sequences and some fine performances, minus the Sex. As mentioned above its like making a body stand without any spine in it. The art was perfectly mastered byDADA KONDKE in the 70s-80s and till date no-one has ever achieved that kind of excellence in this genre in Indian Cinema. To say the truth, the moment anyone else tries to do the same, it all becomes completely class-less, weird and indigestible in a bizarre manner.Putting it differently, KSKHH can also be described as just another unsuccessful attempt to create a SEX COMEDY genre in our Indian Cinema, where we still have to deal with the kind of CENSORS who think that even the vote casting ADULTS in our country are not supposed to hear the four letter word starting with F in the theater. The fact seriously makes me think about the actual age we really become Adults according to the authorities. Moreover here we have CENSORS who can readily pass a film like DELHI BELLY with hugely vulgar dialogues and contradicting themselves, can ask the other producers to mute the exactly similar words in their small films. Therefore, even though KSKHH does manage to hit you hard below the belt at times through its wacky one liners, still it cannot exactly be called a SEX COMEDY film as made in the other parts of the world. Coming to its performances, both Riteish and Tusshar are complete natural when it comes to these kinds of roles, still I couldn't find anything new in their portrayal this time. They play it quite similar to what we have already seen in all their previous comedies. In the female lead, Neha Sharma looks great and acts well too but Sarah Jane Dias's effort is clearly visible and she also needs the support of her great outfits to look good on the screen. Anupam Kher gets wasted in a half- heartedly written role and Chunky Pandey fails to generate any spark. Rohit Shetty (the famous director of Singham & Golamaal series) makes an uninspiring cameo in the film but Razzak Khan shines with his most effective lines, capable of generating a good noise in the theaters.Director Sachin Yardi handles few sequences well, particularly in the second half, but he surely could have gone for a decent storyline to support his talented dialogue writers. At times I also felt that he gave too much attention to the Pug (dog) in the film which could have been replaced by some entertaining scenes in the script. In the technical department, Cinematography and Background score doesn't give you anything special to write about. However the soundtrack of KSKHH scores some decent marks due to its peppy party tracks namely \"Dil Garden Garden\", \"Volume High Karle\" & \"UP Bihar\" redone version.To conclude, KYA SUPER KOOL HAIN HUM may appeal only to the viewers who wish to hear some crazy double meaning dialogues alone in this supposedly called SEX COMEDY. But if you don't find what you were looking for in it, then simply blame the questionable standards followed by our CENSORS more than its makers.\n",

It won't be erroneous to state that BEWAKOOFIYAAN makes a genuine attempt to entertain beyond tested flavours and it succeeds in evoking genuine laughs at regular intervals. On the whole, BEWAKOOFIYAAN springs a pleasant surprise. Watch this wonderful slice of life film for the super performances of Rishi, Ayushmann and Sonam, watertight writing, skilled direction and dollops of humor. Bewakoofiyaan is a genteel, slice-of-life love story that runs with one of the oldest of the standard devices of the genre – strong parental opposition to a proposed marital liaison, with money, or rather the lack of it, playing a big part. But the film does not turn either overly nonsensical or sickly sweet in an ill-advised pursuit of comic effect and cutesy twists. The drama is easy flowing and the romantic track believable.

CSB is is one of those simple experimental fantastic films from 70's which Indian filmmakers have not tried in the last 25 years. I think Golmal and Angoor were the last of this genre. Script of CSB is unbeatable and doesn't deviate for even a second from its aim. Casting is perfect. Vidya Sinha is very good as a good looking middle class office going woman in Mumbai. Male cast is brilliant. With Ashok Kumar, Amol Palekar and Asrani you don't need anyone.Do you? In case you need then there is ever dependable CS Dubey. Dialogs are funny and situation are unique. Music by Salil Chowdhray is fantastic but I wont guarantee if its original. SalilDa was also good at inspired music :>I couldn't stop noticing vacant Mumbai streets. 'Janeman' is very well shot with extras doing there own stuff while Amol and Vidya romancing around. Fantastic idea. I just loved the scene where Arun have his first conversation with Prabha and Nagesh just turns everything upside down. It captures the concept that when things go wrong they go wrong in quick succession. Its very well done. Colonel's analysis or Arun is hilarious 'improper conditioning and defective verbal communication', 'unstable self evasiveness', 'love labor lost case', 'unstable para nautical frustration'. Damn funny. Asrani is so good in his downfall scenes \"Sala Peter Kaam Chod Ke Chala Gaya?\", \"Kahna Nagesh Sahab Ka Order Hai\". Amol's best line is \"Khade Ho Or Kaho Good Morning\". Fantastic film. definitely in the top 25 Hindi films and of course best Basu Chatterjee.\n",

            "Certain films raise not one or two but several questions in your mind about the team behind its making and their basic thought structure before going ahead with such tasteless, ridiculous and uninspiring kind of script without giving it a second thought. So instead of writing a usual review, here I would like to share my conclusions after watching this 'quite hard to see' romantic comedy, wherein I neither found the romance nor any comedy as calmly promoted by its makers with a pretty bad song. 1. \"You are a born film-maker!\" Now this phrase can be interpreted in two ways. One when a person has a great, gifted talent of film-making in him, which he has developed through his own efforts and hard work, working in the field for years before being called a Film-maker. And Two, when a person has simply got born in the family related to film business or movie-making and therefore obviously becomes a Film-maker by default. (And the same theory goes for the actors too in many cases) 2. Sometimes a project just gets all the needed approvals from a corporate house without any objections raised, simply because of the big names backing it from the front, even when there is no script, storyline or an idea shared about what actually they are approving and putting their money in. 3. In such ventures, even the actors don't know what they are actually being signed for, since the script is yet to be given a thought after finalizing the entire schedule and dates. 4. And when the need of the script arises, they just mix and match few of their senior's famous films hurriedly, as if there are only fools coming to the theater and they can be served anything in the name of a film with some glossy faces and songs. 5. Such projects try to incorporate everything which is trending around without any set vision. So if Punjabi is the in-thing, they get a completely insane and horrible song written around a Punjabi word used for the 'Bums' and just don't care to enquire about its actual use in the language at all! (And it was this song, questionably written as \"Tooh\", which simply left me with jaws open in disbelief and disgust like never before in all these recent decades honestly. In fact I cannot remember a Hindi film song falling to this sick and ridiculous level ever to say the least.) 6. Normally in the first day shows of a film, all the theater attendants, caretakers and torch-men are also very much interested in watching the new film, standing quietly along the wall with their eyes on the screen. But in a film such as GORI TERE PYAAR MEIN, even they walk out of theaters after an hour or so and never return back even post intervals. 7. When film-makers who perhaps have never been to any real village or remote areas, try to show a village in their film as per their forced-in script demand. Then it's pretty obvious that it turns out to be completely artificial, senseless and fake, since they haven't got the vision to portray such earthy elements on the screen in reality. And that is possibly the reason why GTPM truly becomes unbearable in its second half as it shifts into a fake village wherein a bridge is to be built in a pure LAGAAN or SWADES style by the star architect. 8. A film like GTPM does teach you a valuable lesson of life too, that sometimes even when there is everything available on the table to make a delicious dish, the cook still may make a silly mess out of it due to his over-confidence or no fear of a failure at all (read no-work) in the near future. 9. Lastly, GTPM strongly makes you wonder that did its makers really knew that for whom or for which target audience they were actually making this film and Why? To end with, if a newcomer (or a struggler writer) would have gone to any of the production houses related with the film, with this SCRIPT in hand to make a movie on. Then either he would have got the rejection right away in hours or the script would have been thrown in the bin as soon as he has gone out of the office after reading only its few opening pages. Anyway, searching for the only silver lining in this black cloud, there are 10 odd minutes of beautiful Shraddha Kapoor in the film, which are watchable. And in case you are too serious to watch her on the screen post AASHIQUI 2, then just see the film at a lower cost ticket before the intermission and simply walk away.\n",

Story is good and focuses on women power featuring how life of an ambitious girl changes itself to a dreadful reality made by her choice. It also warns the difference in Business and Revenges. It's a women on top kind of story where there is only a supporting role of a hero.

            "Two years ago a movie released without much of hype and promotion that was '99\" directed by Raj Nidimoru & Krishna DK .. there was something weirdly brilliant in the film which has some restless characters like we often come across in a Guy Ritchie films... Coming to 2011 the same director duo took restlessness in a metro city to another altitude in \"Shor in the city\".. Shor means \"Noise\" and the concept of noise has been depicted very well throughout the film..Without giving any spoilers there are 3 stories running parallel in the heart land of Mumbai and the stories get connected in the end. It is one of the awesome dark humorous films of India which keeps you involved with the three stories and how noise plays a imp role internally as well as externally creating a metamorphosis of each protagonist ... The restlessness has been portrayed with a sharp editing in the beginning going to and fro with each stories thus building the tension and that elevates to higher decibel till the climax happens. Watch it for the unique treatment of the director duo, the awesome camera work of Tusshar kanti Ray (who did a superb job earlier this year with urban classy Dhobi Ghaat) and equally commendable sound design by Jordi Cirbian which plays the crux of the execution.. And coming to acting department Pitobash is a new talent to watch for.. Hindi cinema is changing from it routine over the top execution and I sincerely hope more films like Shor in the City are being made which are technically brilliant as well as entertaining. Also Ekta Kappor should be applauded for backing this kind of cinema. (previous year she backed the technically brilliant Dibakar Banerjee's Love Sex aur Dhoka)..Go for this Noise , you will not regret. Thumps up to the director duo.P.S: For those who love song n dance.. well there is no dance but a beautiful romantic song Saibo which has been shot beautifully..\n",

            "Keeping in mind the way, erotic & sexual content is both served and seen in a very restricted manner in our Indian Cinema, B.A. PASS certainly needs to be rated as another bold step forward by our Indian film-makers as well as the Censors, without any arguments. Yet, contrary to the above statement, here the best thing about the movie is that its makers and director Ajay Bahl have not made this project just to en-cash all its sensual scenes at the box office like a B-C grade venture. But defying the set parameters of the trade, they do have a thoughtful meaning put into its entire erotic content and also have a fine story to convey to their mature audiences in a truly appreciable manner.Based on a story \"The Railway Aunty\" by Mohan Sikka from the book 'Delhi Noir', B.A. PASS firstly continues with the passion of showing the city of Delhi in a bad light (as repeatedly in films nowadays)and then uses the plot of an unemployed youth and his dilemmas with a novel insight. It revolves around the story of a young boy, who has to stay in Delhi with his aunt (after his parents die) and has also got two young sisters to take care of (staying at a hostel. Now during this stay, along with continuing his studies, he meets a middle aged, good looking lady who teaches him some new lessons of life which bring in sex, lust, greed and crime into his innocent persona turning him into an entirely different person heading towards a tragic end.The film begins calmly and then goes on to deliver some of the boldest scenes ever seen in a mainstream (A Grade) Hindi film promoted decently. However, the fact remains that despite of being much bolder and adventurous in its execution (than what the promos suggested), the erotic scenes in the film are exceptionally shot with a sensitive approach without getting into some extreme skin show or cheap vulgarity. Plus its these sensual scenes only which very insightfully depict the lonely, empty & scary life lived by the richer sections of the society. So till interval it does turn out to be an explosive film with a realistic subject which probably stresses more on serving the hidden instincts of the viewers quite skillfully.Post intermission, as the focus shifts towards the other problems of life faced by the young man (not boy), the pace drops and it more becomes an intense film moving towards a shocking climax which might be depressing for many. But all stories do not have a happy ending and here we have the one which daringly talks about those dark and ugly, avoidable phases of life which do not give many choices to a person caught in their unbreakable trap. The second half gives more attention to its story progression and less to its erotic scenes which might disappoint the viewers coming in just for them. But that's exactly where B.A. PASS excels and gains a fine distinction of being a sensitive film made on an engrossing tale. Its concluding moments make you feel sorry for its main protagonist and then you also have that anger towards everyone who betrayed him along the path, posing as true friends.With a less than 2 hours duration, it has a taut screenplay with no interfering sub-plots of love angles thrown in just for the sake of it. The characterization is brilliant with a special mention of Deepti Naval featuring in only two scenes, who rightly portrays the state of a depressed, lonely but loyal lady, superbly. Also was extremely relaxed to see the dialogues in Punjabi written & spoken as they should have been, without molding the words into Hindi.Regarding the performances, it really needs guts to accept and then also live this kind of negative as well as lustful character on screen with such conviction. And for this Shilpa Shukla surely deserves an applause from one & all. She simply can be called the backbone of the film getting complete support from Shadab who also perfectly plays the part of an innocent boy with conviction. Dibyendu Bhattacharya acts fine as the chess playing friend and the actress playing Shadab's bua (aunt) is equally good.The musical department delivers a soothing track \"Shab\" and an adequate background score to enhance its various sequences. Cinematography (by the director himself) captures all those erotic scenes with a subtle elegance and adds to its dark feel throughout. Yet on the story part, I couldn't digest the angle of sisters continuously calling for help and the boy regularly ignoring them in a strange manner. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the film is not able to connect with the viewer emotionally as desired.Secondly, I strongly oppose to this wrong presentation of DELHI, in many of the recent Hindi films, probably beginning from DEV-D. By just showing the neon-lit lanes of Paharganj area, you cannot represent Delhi as the city of lust, crime and dubious activities like this.So ending on that note, B.A. PASS is a dark, shocking and brutal tale of an unemployed youth caught in the trap of sexy lady. Though marketed as an erotic film, it's an honest attempt with a soul partially reminding you of many worth watching classics of World Cinema. Its few shortcomings don't allow me to rate it as a perfect film but this is indeed the next brave step taken by Hindi Cinema in the recent years undoubtedly. Having said that, one does need to have the vision to look beyond its sensuous stuff and reach the real essence of its story as told by the writer. Because in absence of that this might remain just another stimulating morning show B-C grade film with many erotic scenes for most of the viewers.\n",

            "'Ungli' has a good premise & to an extent, it does justice to it. But, overall, the Writing Material, despite its noble & genuine intentions, doesn't work entirely. Its interesting in parts, not totally.'Ungli' Synopsis: A gang of friends decide to take justice into their own hands & turn into vigilantes. Things take a turn when a cop goes undercover to grill them. 'Ungli' makes an honest attempt to take upon the burning issue of corruption that exists in our country even today. The film begins well & the 'Ungli' Gang give us some gripping sequences, but the pace drops as soon as the Cop enters the scene. The second-hour doesn't hold appeal & the culmination looks hurried. Despite a crisp running-time of 113-minutes, 'Ungli' still isn't able to rise above its flaws. Rensil D'Silva's Screenplay works in bits & pieces. A much tighter second-hour was needed. Milan Zaveri's dialogue, however, are super. D'Silva's Direction is ordinary. Cinematography & Editing are mention-worthy. Music by Various Artists is tuneful.Performance-Wise: Sanjay Dutt delivers a restrained performance. Emraan Hashmi is sincere, although the length of his role is surprisingly short in the first-hour. Randeep Hooda is ever-effective. Kangana Ranaut doesn't get much to do. She looks gorgeous, though. Angad Bedi & Neil Bhoopalam are fair. Neha Dhupia is passable.On the whole, 'Ungli' is a half-baked fare.\n",

            "India is considered as third world country and the reason is justified with over 70% population below the economic level. Whenever we move out in the open we tend to forcefully ignore the scenario. As passerby we observe little kid working in tea stalls to meet their day's meal. Rarely one bother to feel for him, his wish and needs. Even being ignored they tend to build their own world of dreams and live optimistically. This year two brilliant cinema dealt with those kids for whom the world hardly cares – \"Stanley Ka dabba\" and then this week release \"I am Kalam\". Both the films are very different in their execution but both sensitively dealt with the issue of Child labor, a poignant problem of his otherwise \"prosperous\" nation. It also reflects that the young generation is more responsible and sensible than the orthodox old ones and they have the power to build the nation through their liberal views.The film directed by Nila Madhab Panda straightaway comes to the point without beating around the bushes. It introduces Chotu (one of the best child performances in recent times by national award winner Harsh Mayar) who comes with his single mother to the town to earn for living. While on the way the bright eyes of Chotu stares earnestly at the school bus and the uniformed kids.It seemed the whole audience in the theater desperately wanted to see his dream fulfilled. His mother left him in arms of his distant Bhatti Mamosa meaning uncle (a superlative performance by Gulshan Grover) who owns a tea-stall and serves tea to the nearby Haveli (King's palace) and the surrounding hotels where the foreign tourists are lodged. Chotu remains true to his claims picks it up instantly whatever he see, be it making world class tea or understanding the small nuances which are liked by the foreign tourists. Sooner he becomes the blue eyed boy for Mamosa and the foreign tourists.So much so that the filmy bug Laptan (worth mentioning performance by Pitobash) who is the other assistant in Bhatti's shop started becoming jealous of him. Amidst all this Chotu become friends with Kumar Sahab, the prince of the haveli. Chotu also aspires to become like President Kalam and thus starts the heartwarming journey of education and friendship. Even he calls himself Kalam and copied Dr Kalam's hairstyle.Already the film has received national and international awards and acclaims before hitting the silver screen. Indeed the film rightly deserves the accolades it is receiving. Debutant director Nila Madhab Panda knows his craft and with co-writer Sanjay Chauhan they created magic on screen. The character of Chotu aka Kalam is written with utmost sensibilities. The way his intelligence is gradually depicted is noteworthy. It is not only a tale about education but also about friendship and changing mindset. The director first created an invisible mirror to showcase some stark contradiction in the society by the way he depicted the scenes of Chotu and Kumar Sahab. Chotu trying to read under the street lights while Kumar Sahab is at his luxurious best. The contradiction is depicted and it ends there only. The rest is a heart warming tale of two young bright boys who are mutually exchanging education in their own ways. While Chotu is teaching Kumar Sahab Hindi the same is happening other way round and thus build a strong bond of trust. The writers carefully tried to capture the changing mindset of young generation and the stagnating mindset of the older one as the king plays chess leisurely and talks about \"time\" flowing by. While on one hand the king believes in kismet (destiny) the Kumar (prince) rightly retaliates by pointing that \"karma\" (deed) is bigger and thereby showing the liberal new generation. The way Kumar goes against his father's orders by becoming friends with a low caste guy it shows the strength of his character. And similarly for Chotu who didn't befriend Kumar as he saves him in the pre-climax. Without telling the climax the directors successfully portrayed the need for changing mindset which will change the future generation. Harsh Mayar as Chotu or Kalam is a spontaneous performer and was given a deserving national award for his realistic performance. He is one of the best child actors in the business. His performance was so earnest that every audience in the theater stood for a standing ovation as the end credit roles. Gulshan Grover sheds his bad man image and molded himself with ease as he plays the kind hearted Bhatti. French actress Beatrice Ordeix did a splendid job as Lucy, the benevolent tourist who feels for Chotu. Pitobash (after his marvelous performance in Shor in the City) excels in the role of Laptan.The jealousy within him was reflected in each expression of his. Hussan Saad is also talented and quiet confidently plays the role of Kumar Ranvijay. The supporting castes with less known faces gave commendable performances. Technically speaking the landscape of Rajasthan is captured with picturesque perfection by Mohan Krishna whose debut in Ishqiya was also worth mentioning. Prashant Naik craftsmanship as editor needs mention for his flawless juxtaposition of frames. Music composer Abhishek Ray did his job well whose music had the local flavor in it. There is a sequence where different person starts playing different instruments with a mellifluous amalgamation of music of both east and west. On the whole I Am Kalam is a fine piece of art which has its heart and soul in the right place. SMILE foundation needs to be applauded for producing this film and taking the issue to an elevated level. With changing mindset of people one hopes more will contribute to child education thus witnessing a far more developed India in coming years. Hope movies like I am Kalam will change the mindset of those audiences who are watching it and they would eagerly take the cause forward. Cheers to whole team of I Am Kalam.\n",

            "Musicals in America in their heyday were mostly about the lives of prominent show business personalities or small town middle class Americana, never about the outcast or the urban slum dweller. This is not the case with the films of Indian director, Raj Kapoor, especially in Awaara, a 1951 film and the later Boot Polish. These films call attention to the less fortunate and, in the case of Awaara, the vagabond whose life of crime is the inevitable outcome of growing up in the slums. In Awaara, Kapoor's real father (Prithviraj Kapoor) plays a heartless judge who accuses his pregnant wife (Leela Chitnis) of infidelity after she was kidnapped by bandits and throws her out of his home (the logic of this eludes me since she was already pregnant when kidnapped). The stern judge staunchly believes that a thief's son will always be a thief and a good man's son will always turn out good. In a series of flashbacks, the film dramatizes the unfortunate consequences of this belief system. Raju, played by the director Raj Kapoor as an adult and by his brother Sashi Kapoor as a child, is born on the streets and grows up in the slums. Under the guidance of a ruthless bandit named Jagga (K. N. Singh), he turns to stealing to help support his mother. Raj has little to comfort him except for a picture hanging on the bare walls of his house of Rita, his childhood sweetheart played by the stunning Nargis, a real life lover of Kapoor. The romance between Raj and Rita is one of the central motifs of the film and the chemistry between the two is electric. This is especially evident in the boat scene where she performs an exotic dance to the Dum Bhar song, and after she calls him a junglee (savage) and he slaps her in an incident that serves to bring them closer together.Raju, the tramp, is forced to live on his wits but does so with humor and a Chaplinesque charm. When he finds out the true circumstances of his childhood, however, he sets out to get revenge against his father, the judge, and ends up facing a charge of attempted murder in the judge's own courtroom. Rita, a lawyer herself, defends him as she promised she would years ago. She puts the judge on the witness stand and asks pointed questions about how he condemned his wife and child to a lifetime of poverty. Rita holds him and society responsible for the conditions that led Raju to commit his crime and asks the judge to forgive him and admit that Raju is his son. Raju, in turn, offers an impassioned plea to the court to punish him as a criminal but not to neglect the conditions that gave rise to his life of crime. In the end, a very moving scene of attempted reconciliation between father and son had me wiping away the tears. Awaara is reminiscent of both 40s film-noir with its dark cobblestone streets and menacing shadows and, in its social conscience, of the great Italian neo-realists like de Sica. But basically, Awaara is still in the Bollywood tradition; that means drama, romance, music, comedy, and action -- all put together in a total package to appeal to a wide audience. With great songs and dances, amazing dream sequences, style and panache, strong drama, and an inspiring message, it is not surprising that Awaara became one of the most popular films in Indian cinematic history. It is one of my favorites as well.\n",

Remo D Souza should stick to choreography and forget about direction or else he will be left with nothing. A flying Jatt has nothing that the viewers have not seen before. You have scenes pulverized from X Men movies to Superman even Jackie Chan movies. When audience can watch original with better handling why would somebody want to watch this. The director was confused regarding the category of the movie therefore, assuming he was trying the movie should have superhero with comedy and a love story with a social message. What we get is a curry that is garish and silly. Direction is bad. Period!Acting is pathetic -- Tiger Shroff should realize merely action cannot make his film work.Jacqueline should focus on dancing and looking pretty unfortunately, she is bad for these traits as well in the movie. Acting was never her specialty.Nathan Jones is good in his characterK K Mennon is wasted. Amrita Singh is decent.Too many songs and some were not even needed. Music is average.

            "An adorably sweet, entertaining movie having many enjoyable references of three most talked about subjects in our country i.e., Bollywood, Cricket and Pakistan. Plus it's a rare film talking about cross border terrorism without any kind of negativity and full of hope wherein the lead character of the script is just having great fun with everyone around enacting hilariously.Having said that, its frankly also not a perfect movie without any flaws as is being projected in many high star reviews. The film leaves many big loopholes unaddressed in its story-plot like what was the actual reason of kidnapping, how was the warning tape used which they shot after making so much effort and what did the shooting crew do after finding one of their members missing? However despite having such big issues left as it is, FILMISTAAN does provide you the promised entertainment constantly in its two hours and doesn't have any kind of dull moment as such in its enjoyable narration, right from the word go.Actually the film works mainly due to its individual amusing sequences and not because of any detailed plot. It wins over the viewer largely when the characters make an instant connect in many well directed and acted scenes. Like, when Sharib sings \"Yaara Seeli Seeli\" (to a similar tune of legendary Reshma) & \"Maar Daala\", when he renders the dialogues of a complete scene from MAINE PYAR KIYA, when there is a discussion over the cricket players and a world cup match, when an old Hakim talks about his days spent in Amritsar before the partition, when Inaamul Haq talks about his business of pirated Indian film DVDs and when they make the ultimate plan in the end.The scenes immediately form an emotional relationship with the viewer despite having glimpses of some similar gags of Pakistan's famous Umar Sharif and a quite predictable progression post the intermission. But certain warmth in the brilliant natural performances and the convincing direction never lets you count anything damaging in the project and you do enjoy spending time in the theater with both the Hindi film loving characters, entertainingly interacting on the screen.As a known fact already, the film was shot at a very limited budget but the camera-work doesn't let you feel the same at all. Background score provides the right feel at some key moments and the soundtrack (songs) neither attracts nor teases you when played intelligently in between the important sequences. Dialogues do grab your attention at times, written by Sharib himself and it was a great relief not to see any footage wasted on some silly love angle incorporated deliberately, following the set routine.Becoming the most appealing feature of the film, Sharib Hashmi delivers an outstanding act and many might not remember that he was only the guy playing Shah Rukh Khan's Pakistani friend in JAB TAK HAI JAAN too. Sharib completely looks like a filmy keeda in his character of Sunny Arora and so does Inaamul Haq playing the second lead making an equally impressive impact. Their chemistry together makes the second half a treat to watch and the open ending does leave you with a feeling of hope quite positively (whereas many may not like the climax too without any clear culmination). Kumud Mishra plays the terrorist perfectly and Gopal Datt supports him well as his close associate. Among the supporting cast Habib Azmi certainly deserves a special mention playing the old Haqim and the rest do perform their roles efficiently.Summing up, such small but innovative, experimental projects need to be encouraged by the Industry people itself as the viewers are indeed ready for them in this new age of cinema undoubtedly. So do watch FILMISTAAN as a must if you love these kind of unexpected surprises made on interesting subjects in a limited budget, with no star attractions at all.but also keep your expectations level in control in order to enjoy it more.Further moving ahead of the review, I would like to share a personal feeling I had while watching this lovable work by a talented team, lying unsold for two longs years quite shockingly. And the film made me think that Why many of these big shots of the industry could not judge the potential of a well made film like this through their own inner instinct, controlling everything sitting at the top? OR Why any of them couldn't feel the possible chances of this film winning hearts all over? OR Why the big stars like the Khans, Kapoors, Kumars and more are not coming forward to take up or promote such kind of honest and worth releasing efforts being made by many independent producers individually.Further, isn't this short shortsightedness followed by the system fast becoming another kind of a big blockage or hindrance in the path of great cinema being made within the country by some talented yet unknown names? Besides, as a concluding thought just think for a while that if a film like FILMISTAAN kept waiting for its turn, lying unsold for two long years, despite being awarded as the BEST Hindi FILM by the reputed National Award Jury in 2012, ..then how many more similar or may be better small films must be roaming around in the lobbies of these production houses searching for a buyer.No doubt the thought indeed is a quite scary one for all independent film-makers and this is the reason, why I had an inner feeling of pain, discomfort and repulsion, while leaving the theaters after thoroughly enjoying FILMISTAAN.Anyway, with a note of thanks to UTV, I hope the thought reaches many other reputed production houses too and we get to see many more such unknown, hidden yet praiseworthy small efforts in the coming times.\n",

            "Finally!!! This film got released; though, it has been released in a select few screens . 'Haramkhor' have an ambiguous start, an uneasy yet beautifully shot interval and an unexpected end. What is it about ? \"In a small Gujarati town, a school teacher has more than an academic interest in one of his female students\". Trust me, it is more complex than this and i won't spoil it. This film can be seen from the eyes and actions of characters. Characters are well written and played even better. Even small character as 'shaktiman' is well build. +1 for the character development because a few people can achieve that.Shweta Tripahti - A big applaud for her. I never expected that she(actually anyone) could to do justice to the character. She is the big thing here, people. The issues her character is going and how she reacts to it reflects more about the real struggles(i won't spoil) of women( or young girls) in this country.Nawaz - Honestly, most of the film collection(box office) is dependent upon him. He is superstar for independent film and his timing is perfect. Watch out for his humor to keep smile on your faces but soon you will realize why film is called 'HARAMKHOR'.Irfan khan AND Mohd samad - They bliss this film with innocence and immaturity. A naive journey for love and brotherhood. They are undoubtedly one of the reason why this film is beautiful. I guess, they make casual audience feel more comfortable.As a movie - The most important aspect of the film is how different things are falling in the places. The flaws that them more real. As a motive - I cannot even begin to think how hard it was for the director put pieces in the places. Reasons being how sensitive our country is and how taboo is the topic. Kudos to Shlok Sharma for putting the thought and effort for putting forward the motive. It was definitely worth it!Lastly, I have seen the censored version. I might have missed out some scenes.\n",

'Ramaiya Vastavaiya' Synopsis: Ram falls in love with Sona, who lives on the fields of Punjab. He follows her to her farm, where her elder brother challenges him to produce more seed on their fields. If he wins, he will be allowed to marry her.'Ramaiya Vastavaiya' revisits romance, but its got its share of humor & emotional sequences as well. The Love-Story, as mentioned before, is very predictable & clichéd. The viewer can foresee the entire film from the very beginning. In terms of plus points, the film is fairly entertaining, especially in the second-hour, which is crisp. Shiraz Ahmed's Adapted Screenplay offers no novelty, but arrests the viewer's attention in the second-hour. Prabhudheva's Direction is well-done. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is fair. Music by Sachin-Jigar is superb. Performance-Wise: Girish Taurani makes a confident debut. He acts ably, but goes over the top in comedic moments. Shruti Hassan looks gorgeous & delivers a restrained performance. Sonu Sood adds depth to the character he plays. He stands out. Vinod Khanna is efficient, as always. Randhir Kapoor hams. Poonam Dhillion is alright. Nasser & Zakhir Hussain are adequate. Satish Shah is wasted. Paresh Ganatra & Mushtaq Khan are funny. Jacqueline Fernandez sizzles in an item number. On the whole, 'Ramaiya Vastavaiya' has its moments.\n",

            "Life is beautiful in every aspect, every moment and every breath. We forget to live and enjoy the life in present due to hectic schedule and aspirations. \"Dhanak\" is a simple story well told with a strong message embedded deep within.\"Dhanak\" tells the story of siblings Chotu(Krissh Chabhra) and Phoolan(Sapna Singh) who embarks on an unknown journey of dreams and aspirations into a world never explored before.Nagesh Kukunoor has come a long way from his early days of \"Hyderabad Blues\", \"RockFord\", \"3 Deewarein\",\"Iqbal\" to the recent one \"Lakshmi\". Just like \"Iqbal\", \"Dhanak\" is a feel-good cinema that gives a strong message that anything is possible in life if you have a positive attitude. The screenplay, also written by Kukunoor, is superb keeping on your toes with comic scenes between brother and sister that will surely bring down the house. The movie was salvaged due to high publicity given to \"Udta Punjab\" but I would strongly recommend to watch it. The Art Direction by Haris Umar Khan and Cinematography by Chirantan Das captures the beautiful sand dunes of Rajasthan. The music by Tapas Relia explores the rich musical culture of beautiful state. I loved the English-Hindi fusion of \"Damadam Mast Kalandar\". The young artist Sapna Singh and Krrish Chhabra are just fun to watch. The sparkling chemistry between these actors are applauding and will keep smiling throughout. Rest of cast were supportive in their respective roles. On the whole, \"Dhanak\" is a perfect answer to the changing trend of Indian Cinema. Highly recommended. 5/5\n",

            "So here's the thing. If you enjoy movies like Welcome, No Entry, or Singh is Kinng you'll get a kick out of Mubarakan. Remember that if you decide to watch it. Anees Bazmee who directed all of these films brings a crazy tale of misunderstandings in a mad Punjabi family to life and it's a, surprisingly, funny ride.Karan and Charan are twin brothers who grew up with a separate aunt and uncle in London and Punjab respectively and are as different as can be. It's all fun and games until it's time to get marriedKaran is in love with Sweety. Sweety with Karan. Karan's mother hates Sweety. Charan is in love with Nafisa. Nafisa is Muslim. Charan's father doesn't approve. Karan is setup to marry Binkle. Charan meets her instead. Charan now loves Binkle. Binkle's family hates Charan. Karan gets engaged to Binkle. Charan gets engaged to Sweety. Nafisa is furious. And then there's Kartar Mamoo/Chachoo who is aware of the kids' dilemma and tries to help only causing further confusion. Did you think the movie would make sense? Of course it doesn't but don't worry because it's all part of the fun.The first fifteen minutes or so of the film are clunky as characters and relationships are established. Push through because the real mazaa starts when Kartar begins scheming and the movie takes off. As mentioned before this is a comedy about misunderstandings and miscommunication. The humor is clean and never crude or offensive which keeps things family friendly. It's also of the situational variety and often bizarre but this is where Anees Bazmee excels. You'll laugh but also scratch your head wondering why people can't have a normal conversation. They can't. Get over it.Arjun Kapoor does a good job especially as Karan. The body language and facial expressions are well executed. The horror of his last film (Half Girlfriend) is almost forgotten. Almost. Ileana D'Cruz brings a certain charm to Sweety and pairs nicely with Arjun. Athiya Shetty is completely wasted. Neha Sharma, credited as a guest appearance, has more to do and say than Athiya. The supporting players are well cast. Ratna Pathak Shah is a treat to watch, as usual. The real star, however, is Anil Kapoor. His comic timing brings the house down and he excels even when the plot stagnates. Mr. Kapoor's performance alone is worth the price of a ticket.If you know what you're getting into Mubarakan is a wild and laugh-out-loud funny ride. Don't overthink it and you won't be bored. It's a little long and at least one song could've been chopped off but there are enough moments that will bring a smile to your face. Mubarak to the Kapoor chacha and bhatija, I was entertained.\n",

            "Ram Gopal Varma is according to me one of the finest filmmakers India has seen. The artistic excellence of his works, the originality of his scripts, and the general unique finesse of his style are extraordinary. \"Kaun?\" is one of his better works. It is a very unconventional Hindi film for its time (or even today). It is a small, relatively short thriller, and as a thriller, it is simply superb.It is atypical in that it is only one hour-and-a-half long, it has no songs, there are only three characters, and the entire story takes place in one house during one rainy night. This may resemble in many ways Yash Chopra's classic Ittefaq, and Varma might have taken some inspiration from Chopra's classic, but mind you, just inspiration; \"Kaun?\" is very much a film of its own.The story develops at a steady pace and focuses the viewer's attention on every tiny detail. The background score, the taut, unpredictable script, the fairly peculiar characters, all contribute to the film's suspenseful mood. Every scene in the film is relevant, interesting and thrilling, never letting the viewer get distracted for even one minute right until the rather shocking end.The film's main protagonist is played by the absolutely fantastic Urmila Matondkar, who displays fear, confusion and total madness through her ever so intense facial expressions and body language to create a memorably ambiguous and freaky lady. The two co-actors support well, and it's rather unusual to see the wonderful Manoj Bajpai playing the typical moronic fellow.\"Kaun?\" is an honest attempt by Varma which works very well for various reasons. The film provides chilling entertainment, and its intensely dark proceedings as well as its surprising ending make it one of the greatest thrillers made in Hindi cinema in recent times. Sadly, not enough films of this sort are being made in India, and when they are, they get little notice. A must-watch.\n",

Demonstrating Kalki's extraordinary acting ability.The story was very precious and demonstrated how somebody with the lead characters challenges still strives to have a normal life. And id doing so it became apparent that even with her physical disability she is able to lead a normal and filling life.Possibly even more so then people who are able bodied.It we actually a very beautiful film. The film style which was very simplistic actually made it very believable. I will definitely see another Kalki Koechlin film and I can only hope that it is as good as Margarita with a Straw.\n",

The film keeps you on the edge of your seat and takes you through a roller-coaster ride as you feel the emotions going through the main character played by Aishwarya. Irfan Khan is charismatic as ever proving why he is one the finest and sought after Actors in the world. Overall believable and compelling characters in unbelievable yet fascinating situations. Plot twists that leave you stunned and amazed at having the rug spectacularly pulled out from under your feet. Suspense scenes that, spectacular though they might be, serve to strengthen the storyline. And, most of all, this is the kind of story that grips you like a vice, never knowing what's coming until the very end.\n",

Salman acted quiet well and has good comic timing, moreover, he looks better with age! A thespian he isn't but is pretty tolerable in movies like this .Sneha was really cute and has that special something about her on screen, her acting was not much to write home about, but then her character didn't require much acting either . She has screen presence, evident even in a movie like this, and more so than I expected from the promos. Mithun- he was funny @ times( when parodying old Hindi film dialogs), although he was OTT too!The songs were VERY well picturised, the romantic moments between the lead pair were well done with requisite amounts of angst and didn't leave one with an uneasy feeling at all ( despite the age gap). They had good chemistry together on screen . The cinematography was awesome, the screenplay was OK in parts. There was suspension of disbelief involved but a good movie( like this one) should make the viewers WANT to suspend disbelief rather than make them irritated. The movie was well directed on the whole .All in all, a nice 2 hours 17 minutes at the cinema..\n",

            "It's always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens. My film-crazy friends and I habitually did this in our college days. Long years later, the thrill has not worn off. This time, the film I lined up to watch at its first screening in town is \"Eklavya  The Royal Bodyguard\". Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the filmmaker who, in the capacity of either director or producer, gave us \"Parinda\", \"Mission Kashmir\", \"Parineeta\", and the two wonderful Munna Bhai movies, was unveiling his new directorial effort, and I was eager to see what lay in store.\"Eklavya\" boasts a huge cast of eminent actors; how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time. The glittering line-up features Amitabh Bachchan in the title role, along with Chopra regulars Saif Ali Khan, Sunjay Dutt, the exquisite Vidya Balan, Boman Irani, Parikshat Sahni, Jackie Shroff, Jimmy Sher Gill, Raima Sen, and an elegant cameo by Sharmila Tagore.The film opens with the unmistakable voice of Amitabh Bachchan narrating the legend of Eklavya from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Eklavya, a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of Dronacharya, the instructor of kings. Contemptuous of his low birth, Dronacharya refuses to accept Eklavya as a student. Undeterred, Eklavya builds a clay effigy of Dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it. Soon after, Dronacharya is taken aback by Eklavya's proficiency, which has outstripped that of his princely pupils. As it wouldn't do for this commoner's skills to rival those of the royalty, the crafty Dronacharya demands a \"dakshina\" or teacher's fee from Eklavya. Whatever you wish, the devoted lad replies. Your right thumb--that is what I want as my \"dakshina\", commands Dronacharya. Without hesitation, Eklavya slices off the thumb, knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery. The story is meant to illustrate the notion of \"dharma\" or the fulfillment of one's sacred duty in any circumstance, regardless of cost. Off screen, the child to whom Amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome, and his shrill tones are the voice of reason.Amitabh, like his dutiful namesake Eklavya, is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in Rajasthan. Despite the family's tyrannical ways, he unswervingly stands by them. The film unfolds in the present, but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory, entitlement, and unquestioned power. Their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless, and the worm is about to turn.The Queen Mother's (Sharmila Tagore) deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque, overwrought plot in motion. The heir apparent (Saif Ali Khan), who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives, is summoned home for her funeral. Before breathing her last, the Queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans. This confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross, intrigue and counter-intrigue.The film has the look and feel of a stately epic, but Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics. There is a business-like economy in his approach. There is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse. He appears to say that was then, in the past, there's no time for that; let's simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now. Voice-overs and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present. The pace is breathless, as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation. Every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored. An effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in \"Hamlet\", and the wraith, despite no lines to declaim, has similar impact.Amitabh Bachchan's magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty, having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot. Saif Ali Khan impresses yet again; there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience. Unlike \"Parineeta\", Vidya Balan doesn't have a whole lot to do here, but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince. Boman Irani, an actor of sweeping range and intelligence, is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe-eyed ambiguity, while Jackie Shroff and Jimmy Sher Gill, as the wicked uncle and cousin, handle the villainy with lip-smacking gusto. Sunjay Dutt, fresh off his Munnabhai success, is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty. What a pleasure it is to see Sharmila Tagore, who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years.\"Eklavya\" displays a most un-Indian efficiency (in film-making terms, at least) and speed (a mere 105 minutes) in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters. It would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floorperhaps the DVD will have the deleted scenes. Music is used appropriately: there is a lone song, of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen. The cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous Rajasthani terrain, with its pitiless crags and sun-scorched sands. Clearly, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film, and glowing endorsements from the likes of Ralph Fiennes enhance his chances. Here's to you, Mr. Chopra, and more power to you.\n",

            "\"1942 A Love story\" is a portray of a beautiful love story with the backdrop of the Indian struggle for freedom.The plot is still the same of a love story but unlike other Bollywood movies the villains are not the parents but the political turmoil of 1942.Vidhu Vinod who was just three movie old when he made this movie teams up with the genius Sanjay Leela Bhansali ( screenplay) to deliver a movie which is definitely the best of 93.With an impressive star cast of Anil Kapoor, Prem , Jackie Shroff,Danny, Ashish Vidyarthi and Anupam Kher this one could have never gone wrong.The story runs on two parallel lines one is the love story between Rajjo(Manisha Koirala) and Narender(Anil Kapoor). The other story is about the assassination of general Douglas.THe music of the movie is absolutely amazing R.D.Burman delivers yet another masterpiece which was unfortunately his last. Manisha Koirala fits so well in the role of an innocent and beautiful young girl.THe introductory scene of Manisha Koirala is absolutely amazing.\"Ek Ladki KO \" and Kuch Na Kaho are one of the best pasteurized songs. Kuch Na Kaho gets you into the moment so well.THe on screen kiss if definitely one of the best on the Indian screen.Javed Akhtar wrote the songs that are just a brilliant example of superb poetry.THe songs are a part of the story and since they are so good you don't get irritated when they pop up unlike other Hindi movies.The story takes a sharp turn just before the interval after the death of Anupam Kher when Manisha Koirala is rescued by Jackie Shroff and the conditions forces Anil Kapoor to jump into the struggle of Indian independence.performance wise Jackie steals the show delivering the role of a young and self driven freedom fighter he is able to portray the emotions and feelings to picture perfect.BUt that does not undermines the performances of other actors.I give this movie a 9 out of 10 a must watch for people who believe that Indian cinema is not dead yet and there are great film- makers who will deliver the best when ever they could\n",

            "I remember many, many years ago, someone said to me, \"I don't think Andy's coming - do you want his place?\" Before even the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, before the middle east became a constant war-ground, a number of my friends would follow the 'hippy trail' - overland to India through the strange and wonderful lands on the way like Afghanistan. I didn't go. I often dreamt of the strange civilisations of Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, lands of jinn, ancient cultures, strange customs. Today, visiting Afghanistan for a Westerner is almost unthinkable - travelling there overland probably suicidal. Understanding the country through anything but a western political lens almost impossible.How refreshing to see a film made there with care and attention to authenticity. A film that is half thriller, half comedy. And one that conveys some of the complex attitudes of a warring people for whom it is the only home they ever know or want.Indian director Kabir Khan, although with considerable security, is able to come and go much easier than any Westerner could. I can't imagine even Mel Gibson going out to Kabul to make a motion picture right now. Khan's actors are all cast according to their nationality.Two Indian rookie reporters make the strangest roadtrip ever - trying to get an exclusive story on the Taliban following 9/11. They meet up with an Afghan driver, a gorgeous American Reuters photographer, and a Pakistani 'Talib' who by turns holds them hostage or doesn't. They are waylaid by police, bandits and mujahedin as they make a treacherous trip across a vivid no-man's-land through breathtaking scenery to the border. On the way they discover much about the complexities underlying Afghanistan as well as about themselves and each other.Kabul Express is the first feature film to be shot extensively in Kabul after the official end of the Taliban's reign and demonstrates the director's love of the country and its people, as well as an incredible sense of humour that both accurately portrays and caricatures all the various races involved.The film seems to have no particular political agenda, and if the Taliban and Pakistan probably come off a bit worse than anybody else, the locals who reinstate fairly barbaric time-honoured sports and customs are not a picture of civilised thinking either. The different reactions of our travellers to a game involving tearing an animal to bits, or beating a couple of Talibs to death with bare hands, speak volumes.In one particularly moving scene, the extremely resourceful Taliban fighter is re-united with his daughter. I found the moment where she only lifts her burka (veil) secretly watching him depart particularly heart-wrenching.Kabul Express is a film made by an Indian company and not totally divorced of bias - there's no love lost between India and the Taliban over Kashmir, for instance - but as it's not the bias we are used to in the West it is nevertheless a invigorating look into a country that has become almost unintelligible. It may be uncomfortable or even disjointed viewing for anyone emotionally locked into a politicised and over-simplified picture of Afghanistan, but if you can put that aside for an hour or so it is truly an eye-opener.While not exactly a blockbuster, the film comes across as warm, genuine, exciting and displays a range of humour I've rarely come across. I am also indebted to several Indian members of the audience without whose laughter I would have missed several subtle and very Indian-type jokes.Kabul Express is a rare film experience and I strongly recommend it.\n",

The fictitious village comprises of characters very humane, easily identifiable and oozing with simplicity (well, not quite!). The narrative is extremely smooth and carries you with the flow. Shyam Benegal attempts an unexplored territory and once again he proves what a versatile director he is. With \"Welcome to Sajjanpur\" Shyam Benegal to a certain degree incorporates commercial elements into his style yet retaining the flavour of parallel cinema. All the characters seem hand-picked as they are perfectly suited to the \"T\". Every actor gets adequate space as per the demands necessitated by the character. It seemed only Divya Dutta's character/ role was not fleshed out / elaborated (and her participation in the end was kind of coming).

Awfully uninspiring, terribly melodramatic and overdone, with a cliché and unoriginal screenplay. The cast is just one bunch of poseurs. Abhishek Bachchan is in the lead, and he is awfully miscast as the \"tough\" cop. Sanjay Dutt has nothing to do there. Sunil Shetty unsurprisingly overdoes his role and Zayed Khan is more laughable than funny with his annoying fake accent. Shilpa Shetty's Tomb Raider look is one of many mistakes made in the career of an otherwise talented actress who did not get good role offers. At times I was really wondering what the director was thinking while copying some of the most famous scenes of Hindi films. Like, for one, the group song which had them all singing a song when out of nowhere they noticed Sanjay Dutt's serious expression, stopped singing, and then, he suddenly starts singing and dancing with them in a very cheesy way. It is so clearly lifted from the song \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\" from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, involving Amrish Puri and Shahrukh Khan. The final scene is simply pathetic, and so is this film. Avoid this dreadful cheapo at any cost.\n",

            "I saw Jhoom Barabar Jhoom while travelling in Rajasthan, in the Raj Mundir in Jaipur, which is, with some justification, described as the best cinema in Asia (and it certainly beats watching a film in a 'Multiplex' on a screen the size of a large TV in London).As the film ended and the huge audience of all ages rose, making its way into the grand, pretty foyer, I turned to an Indian man in his thirties next to me and asked him in Hindi if he liked it. He said he loved the songs, particularly the song of the title, which he thought would get even the most unlikely person in the cinema dancing in the aisles. Then he added,'But the the rest of the film is nonsense'.I certainly agree with him about the infectious song of the title, having badly hummed it often. However, I don't think the rest of the film is nonsense. What I believe many people mistake for nonsense is actually a playful, kitsch, knowingly referential film revolving around the desires and problems of self-mythology, and the power of Bollywood fantasy. The film is set in Waterloo station where a young Indian man and woman of Pakistani origin bump into each other and form an acquaintance while waiting for infamously late English trains. But their talk about themselves, we come to see, may not quite be so credible and ingenuous. Not only this but there is something magical in the air at Waterloo Station, for a wondering busker, Amitabh Bachan, looking like a sixties drop out, is somehow mysteriously involved in the lively plot.The two leads, Bachan's son Abishek, and Preity Zinta, make engaging leads and, alongside the wonderfully outrageous Laura Dutta and Bobby Deol handle the film's sense of fun and comedy vigorously (though perhaps the nods to the famous Bachan/Deol partnership in Sholay goes too far).Another thing about Jhoon Barabar Jhoon is its sure sense of place, something few Indian films set in Britain can claim.

            "Here is another example of a reasonably fine movie presented with completely wrong promos and a misleading promotional campaign. And the strange thing is that the blunder is once again committed by the experienced Yash Raj Films who did exactly the same with their earlier project \"Rocket Singh\". Simply putting, \"Pyaar Impossible\" is neither a youthful movie about college life nor it talks about any campus affairs as prominently shown in its on-air promos.Conversely, it is a simple story of a one-sided love affair, also featuring a girl child artist playing a prominent role in the script and has a story-line, which somehow seems to be less appealing for the younger audiences. So, if you are expecting a trendy, college campus love flick, featuring a geek and a beauty, then you are sure going to be disappointed big time. But the saving grace is that the movie still manages to impress the viewers to some extent, mainly through its engaging second half, where the plot actually starts moving at the much needed speed. Whereas before intermission, the narration has nothing great to offer and you just keep waiting for something more interesting to happen on the screen very soon.Basically, I am still wondering why Jugal Hansraj (director) and Uday Chopra, who has also written the story, screenplay and dialogues for the movie, opted for such confusing promos for their project, which no-where talk about the real movie in the offering. In fact all the scenes in the promos on-air are just taken from the first 15 minutes of the movie and the rest is completely left untouched. To be precise, I couldn't figure out, what was the purpose of promoting the movie as a college drama, when its main lead female character is actually a divorcée single mother living alone with her kid girl. That was really a silly attempt to bring in the young crowd into the theaters to fetch a good initial. However, the move may turn against the movie, since all the youngsters are not going to find the content they were really feeling excited for. Jugal Hansraj once again misses the bull's eye with even Priyanka being there for him as a merit.Nevertheless, apart from this publicity goof up, \"Pyaar Impossible\" is a decent movie with worth watching performances from the lead pair and the girl child. Priyanka Chopra once again leads from the front, with her stunning outfits and gorgeous looks. Her solid portrayal of a stylish and educated single mother, rightly proves why she is considered as one of the best talents we currently have in our Hindi Cinema. Uday Chopra as her silent lover, surprisingly gives a stunner performance in the role of a geek. He is simply not the same Uday, you may recall from his previous films. He has not only grown as an actor but also showcases his other talents of writing and scripting a story of his own. Advika Yadav, the kid girl playing Priyanka's daughter is a delight to watch and a talent to look out in the future. Anupam Kher is lovable in his few scenes and Dino Morea is quite impressive in his negative role.Musically, the film has majority of its songs written partly in English which have a limited appeal. Music directors Salim-Sulieman have worked more on their song arrangements and less on the melody part of their musical score. Hence, though the tracks sound good but they don't stay in your mind for long. Cinematography captures Singapore's outdoor locations skillfully.In a nutshell review, \"Pyaar Impossible\" is a good one time watch mainly for its performances, but it has nothing as suggested by its trendy and youthful promos. The movie is based on an urban subject revolving around computer software and its piracy which strictly makes it a multiplex movie and can work only in the metros. You can watch it for both Priyanka and Uday but don't expect any college romance out of it.\n",

            "This was more of a gamble and I had left it last to watch but I'm glad that I did because Chalo Dilli provided me with plenty of laughter and surprise.Vinay Pathak wasn't the surprise- he's a really underrated actor who's more than capable of taking the lead role of a movie and turning it into a success and joy to watch and this is but a shining example. I felt that he was never irritating, loud or obnoxious. The best description of his character that comes to my mind is \"happy go lucky.\" Whatever situation or jam that he gets himself in he never gives up and it was amazing to watch him make friends everywhere. The dialogue is very good and the jokes are very funny, even the visual gags.For me Lara Dutta turned out to be the surprise package with a very good performance. I've never really thought much of her acting abilities but here she does a very good job as a stuck up high profile modern business woman who comes unglued as the movie progresses. Yes, she looks very glamorous and high profile but it suited the character. What she brought to the role was pep and edge. She wasn't rude or obnoxious and she certainly wasn't above remorse and making apologies.The movie itself had several things going for it. For one they didn't make the two lead characters fall in love with each other. There was no sexual tension, no longing looks and hence there was no need for pointless love songs to appear and the wrong moments. Even the songs that were in the movie were well placed.Lara Dutta's character wasn't a one dimensional person who does an about turn at the end and becomes opposite to what she started out as, unlike most of the Indian movies where a character starts out as stuck up, rude and arrogant but withing a few scenes turns into a demure, polite, law abiding and super nice person. Her change is gradual and only reflects what's within her and that's more of an insight as opposed to a behavioural change.This is a really fun movie to watch at any time of day and is definitely not a waste of time. Sometimes strangers can turn out to be saints in disguise, opening facets that lie hidden deep within, unknown to ourselves, and when opened can turn our lives upside down, bringing new adventures and insights for a better life. In Chalo Dilli Vinay provides that stranger while Lara represents the rest of us.\n",

            "Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Parinda is one of the first Hindi films dealing with life in the Mumbai underworld and one of the most realistic of its kind. Stylishly presented, the film is excellently directed and is aided by fantastic cinematography, great editing, beautiful music and natural acting. As opposed to most of the Hindi movies of that time, the story of Parinda is devoid of clichés, and the screenplay as well as the dialogues are well written. There are neither the typical courageous action heroes nor the exaggerated fantasy action sequences one gets to see so much in Hindi films, though at some points you do feel its loyalty to the general Hindi film style (that's called commercial pressure). Chopra portrays the relationship between the two brothers authentically, as he does with practically every other relationship in the film.The narrative is very focused and taut, letting the director create the required mood for a gripping drama of its sort. The film's emotional impact is thus strong, though it does get a bit too slow and dark at places. The acting is for the most part excellent. This is one of Jackie Shroff's finest performances, powerful and heartfelt, strong and restrained. Nana Patekar plays the psychologically disturbed fire-phobic Anna with intensity and conviction, portraying every negative shade of his character in his well-known inimitable style. Madhuri Dixit is lovely in a role that is not very substantial. However, Anil Kapoor is just okay and his often childish and overly naive on-screen persona gets on your nerves from time to time. His character's transformation was also too quick to be believable. This is of course not entirely his fault.Which brings me to the next point. Parinda, though compelling and innovative for its time, is not without its flaws. While RD Burman's music is stupendous as always and managed to relieve the film's raw tension, as it was done with the soulful and memorable \"Tum Se Mil Ke\", the other melodious songs seemed inappropriate in such a dark thriller and often distracted from the seriousness of the situation. The marriage song, for one, was completely redundant. Additionally, some of the scenes towards the end were quite implausible and went a bit over-the-top, though I really liked the film's final scene, which was overwhelming. Overall, Parinda is an enjoyable and impressive gangster movie known today as a favourite cult movie among lovers of Indian cinema. It's easy to see why. It was different and entertaining, but its intentions were stronger than its actual quality.\n",

            "If you asked any of the great Bollywood actors who worked in this film whether or not it was the most fun project of their lives, they'd probably all answer \"yes\". Adapted from the musical \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\", this film is crammed with one-liners and quotes that will ricochet in your memory eternally. The songs are amongst the best to have come out of India during that whole period, and are instantly recognisable today. Having grown up under the Amitabh umbrella and seen all of the classics, this film still shines as one of his most memorable ventures. A playful look at a family of 7 brothers living on a farm, with all it's ups and downs, tragedies and laughter, and the impressive effort by all of the cast, it's truly a gem.\n",

            "Previous reviews have puzzlingly stated that this is one of the first films to break away from the commercial traditions of Bollywood. In fact, it belongs to a different tradition altogether - art cinema reflecting social themes - which has been going on since at least the early 1950s in India (where it was initially strongly influenced by Italian neo-realism) in the work of Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak. All three were, perhaps significantly, Bengalis, and partook of the rich intellectual traditions of that region, most widely associated with the great poet and national figure Rabindranath Tagore.The Chess Players is a delight from beginning to end. Taking its cue from the origins of chess as a war-strategy training game, Ray builds two narrative strands in parallel: in the mid-1850s, a pair of idle aristocrats become obsessed by chess and play it all day long, oblivious to the collapse of their domestic relationships that it causes; and in the larger world outside, the scheming and strategy of the chess-board is played out in the real-life scheming of the East India Company as it attempts to manoeuvre the Nawab of Oudh from his throne and bring the state within British jurisdiction. The two plotlines are beautifully brought together at the end when, after hearing that Company troops have moved in and the Nawab has abdicated, the chess-playing friends change their board layout to the Western manner, which involves the king and queen changing their starting positions: \"Move over, king. Make way for en] Victoria!\"There are fine performances all round: from Amjad Khan as the Nawab, whose infinitely delicate sensibilities lead to infinite puzzlement at the connivings of the less fastidious, to Richard Attenborough as the Company representative in Oudh whose job it is to unseat him, who manages to convey a genuine belief that the state needs to be better run, with an underlying realization that he has no right to do what he is doing. Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey, as the chess players Mirza and Mir, both have extremely expressive faces that can switch from blustering bonhomie to pained hurt, or from deadpan seriousness to quizzical amusement, in a heartbeat. Jaffrey's talent for comedy will come as no surprise to viewers of his English-language films, and he provides the film's finest comic moment when he walks into his bedroom to find his wife trying to hide her lover (his nephew) under the bed - a moment straight out of a Feydeau farce. Two moments of great artistic beauty stand out for me. First, when the Nawab, overwhelmed by the political situation while in conference with his ministers, seeks solace in a haunting, graceful song he had composed in a happier time (actually composed by Ray - perhaps the director showing us his self-identification with the character). Second, in a scene where Mir is left on his own at the chessboard while Mirza goes off to \"see what the trouble is\" with his wife, the camera follows Mir as he gets up and goes out into the hallway to see where his friend has got to. The camera then stays still as he retraces his steps, and in the vertical slice of light caused by a gap between two curtains that separate the hallway and the chess room, we see framed the precise point on the chessboard where Mir's hand slowly and surreptitiously comes into view as he sneakily moves one of the pieces. A virtuoso piece of camerawork and compositional framing that, like the film as a whole, never fails to enchant.\n",

            "An inspired or copied film doesn't provide me enough excitement to write about it in details. And F.A.L.T.U. remains one of those unofficial inspired movies which fearlessly take the main idea from another director's work and then serves it with some extra toppings to the viewer as an original creation. But in this case, even the copy is not the first as there was another movie released in year 2010 which was also based on the same idea taken from the English flick \"Accepted\" (2006). Yes, \"Accepted\" too is said to be made around a similar idea used in few other movies such as \"Camp Nowhere\" (1994). But still this fact cannot be used as an excuse by the makers of FALTU for their copying act.Some students who are not able to get admission in any reputed college due to their low percentage think of opening a fake university online, just to show to their parents that they have been accepted there. But their idea turns out to be big problem when the university becomes famous on the net and more students apply to it unknowingly. Last year we had a small budget movie called ADMISSION OPEN which was also based on this novel original thought of Steve Pink's \"Accepted\". And this year we have a comparatively decent budget movie made on the same topic from the house of Vashu Bhagnani. In the original the fake university is called \"SHIT\" which stands for South Harmon Institute of Technology and in this present copy version it is called \"FALTU\"which stands for Fakirchand and Lakirchand Trust University.As a movie experience, F.A.L.T.U. gives you the same result as per its title. Its weak, its amateurish and has too many songs which irritate. Thought some of the tracks are good but coming one after another just like that, make the viewer restless. The script takes too many liberties in its execution of an interesting idea and as a result the proceedings on the screen look like childish and unbearable. Like I couldn't understand where from all that money used to come for paying the huge bills of the University? The writers also try to incorporate the idea of \"Do what you want to do in your Life\" in the film on the lines of \"3 Idiots\", but in the process fail completely. At certain points, it even gives you an impression of a film made in a hurry, which is surprising since it features the producer's son (Vashu Bhagnani) too in the lead. The director Remo D'Souza directs too simply with only the climax giving you something to rave about. Particularly the dance sequence which is his forte stands out and impresses. But again we have already witnessed some similar excellent performances in the director's TV show \"Dance India Dance\" too. In the acting department also, I didn't find anyone doing something great in the film out of the routine. And I really felt sad seeing Arshad Warsi, Ritesh Deshmukh and Boman Irani being wasted in such a way. However, despite of all these drawbacks I would like to support one good idea put forward by its writers which surely deserves an applause. The thought is that if all the colleges give admissions only to the students securing above 70% then why the passing percentage is kept at 33%. In this scenario what all those majority students are supposed to do, who manage to secure only marks in between 33 and 70 percent. So to avoid all this rejection and confusion why don't keep the passing percentage only at 70% which will further motivate the students to study more harder.The idea is great, sounds logical and gets my full support too. But unfortunately I cannot recommend you to see the movie only due to this noble thought presented. So for this week, just plan to do something better than this FALTU.\n",

            "If one wishes to list the negative features associated with this first biggie of 2015, then TEVAR has got many. Beginning with once again being an official remake of a south hit titled OKKADU (Telugu – 2003) revolving around the same old repetitive plot seen many times before with a much longer length than required due to many below average unwanted songs thrown just at the wrong timings slowing its otherwise racy pace quite severely. Full of fights, swords, guns, goons and murder it has all clichéd characters ranging from a carefree boy-hero, his group of friends, a police officer father, a caring mother, a bubbly sister, an active politician with his cunning brother and a heroine who is the center of attraction as always in a typical Bollywood film.But despite all the above mentioned flaws, I am still not willing to ridicule the film completely since it does give you many decent masala moments within this fixed format and has many technical merits in its favour too ranging from a pulsating background score, excellent camera-work and some well-conceived long action/chase sequences shot on actual locations, providing the much required exciting moments throughout along with some fine performance delivered by the known names.Starting with an enjoyable local feel of a small town TEVAR opens energetically featuring Kabaddi, an introductory fight and a well- choreographed song \"Superman\" in the first 15 minutes. But then goes back to all formula twists as Sonakshi and other major characters enter the screen with some entertaining dialogues. Its major plot gets revealed just after the dragging \"Radha\" song and the film becomes entirely predictable post that sequence unarguably. The poor songs keep hindering the pace one after another adding to the over-length of the film making it more than 150 minutes long. And then, though the film keeps coming up with some engaging moments at a regular basis both before and after the interval, it sadly all ends with a pretty poor, obvious and over the top climax that should have been altered.However what still makes TEVAR a fairly entertaining film for the masses is the sum of few well written dialogues, superbly conceived action as well as confrontation sequences and Manoj Bajpai alone to be straight. Arjun Kapoor gives an honestly worked out performance (particularly in the action sequences) justifying his banal lead character making a visible effort but his overall impact still lacks the punch probably due to the thin voice texture and a bit of over-confidence. Astonishingly Sonakshi Sinhaonce again does a similar 'seen before' kind of role as if she is doing it in a sleep walk whereas the supporting cast efficiently lift up the film featuring the impressive Raj Babbar (as the father), Deepti Naval (mother), Subrat Dutt (as Bajpai's sidekick),Rajesh Sharma (as the politician) and the girl playing Arjun's younger sister.Returning to Manoj Bajpai, the main savior of the film, its really amazing how he manages to add a lot of newness in a character that he has already played in a few films before. And that's exactly the reason why he is considered one of the most gifted actors of our present times unanimously. In other words TEVAR majorly survives due to Manoj Bajpai ruling the scenes in particular along with the worth watching action, dialogues and cinematography capturing the local feel effectively. Having said that, its editing taking out at least 3 songs and few sequences could have resulted in much better film for sure.Directed by the talented Amit Ravindernath Shar as his debut film, it does give you glimpses of an experienced man who knows his job well. And I hope he chooses a fresh theme next time coming up with a complete entertainer surprising both the masses as well as the classes together. The man has got the eye and probably an ear too as he aptly uses a soft sad number \"Main Nahin Jaana Khereyan De Naal\" towards the end that is an original song sung by the maestro Tufail Niyazi from Pakistan.Ending on a nostalgic note, whenever there is a film like TEVAR solely made for the masses and smaller centers, I prefer to watch it in a single screen theater if possible as that remains the best place to watch such movies with the energetic roaring crowd instead of the silent, sophisticated audience of a multiplex. And all readers above the age of 35 would readily agree with the fact that watching a Bollywood masala movie in a single screen theater makes a major difference in your viewing and enjoying the film altogether without any doubt.In short, nothing can beat the experience of watching a typical masala Hindi film at a single screen and its really sad that the coming generations are going to miss it. So if you love watching these movies specifically made for the masses and are a fan of Manoj Bajpai too then TEVAR can be tried as a one-time watch for the exceptionally talented actor alone, preferably at a single screen.\n",

This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! It's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV, and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why!(Whole college is standing around Manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad guy 2: Yes,we won't do it again. (No response from Manisha) Akshay: Come on,forgive them! Manisha: I don't know... Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! And these are living young males! Don't blame them!Pancholi: Yeah Manisha.. Manisha(To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? Suniel: I'd break their hands,legs and kill them.But anyways,just forgive them..Akshay: Yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munish) can do basically anything..He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. Every actor takes turns to speak..One line from Akshay,then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. And then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! All these things make it an enjoyable movie, and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..The only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.\n",

Also the fantastic music.But the Hindi version might have lost something in translation. I watched it but its not a bad movie. I agree that the supporting cast has done a better job than the new hero-heroine. And the ending makes all the twists and turns pointless. But I guess Gautam menon was not sure if the Hindi audience would accept the same Tamil ending. I hope that someone who has fallen in love with a girl and lost her would be able to relate to the story. For the same reason, I urge all to watch the director's cut version with the alternate ending.But still the movie is not as bad like the critics have reviewed. The whole point of the movie is that this is a story about a 22 year old boy who is acting like a 19 year and a girl who is confused and prefer to suffer than go against her parents. Don't expect super melodrama or cheap comedy or item numbers. I have lost count of friends who have told its their story.I give 7 stars because of the dialogs, music, camera, good performances by support cast.\n",

            "Among the contemporary Bollywood movie directors, I am a big fan of the director-due Abbas-Mustan. Their filmmaking style contains watching the DVD of some good Hollywood thriller, then getting the script of their next movie ready by using the theme of that Hollywood movie, changing the characters and the milieu according to the taste of the Bollywood movie audience and getting some good songs composed by the music directors. Earlier they used to borrow the title also from some old commercially successful Bollywood movie. This formula has worked well for them in many movies made by them. One such movie is Humraaz (2002) whose title has nothing to do with the story or the classic Hindi movie made by B.R. Chopra - Hamraaz (1967).There are only three main characters in the story - Karan (Akshaye Khanna) who is the leader of a music band, Priya (Ameesha Patel) who is Karan's associate in the band and sweetheart in the real life and Raj (Bobby Deol) who is a multimillionaire businessman. Karan manages to get the contract of running music band on Raj's cruise and then his sweetheart Priya makes Raj fall in love with her. The director-duo has very generously exposed it at the interval point itself that the love of Priya for Raj is fake and she has trapped him in that under some scheme masterminded by her real sweetheart Karan.After the interval, the game of checks and checkmates begin between Karan and Raj when Raj comes to know about the real link between Karan and Priya. However Priya bows before the real love of Raj for her and she no longer remains as willing to dance to the tune of Karan and be a faithful wife to Raj instead. Raj first decides to kill Priya considering her as infidel but soon he comes to know of the change of her heart also. However by that time, he has already taken his plan to ensure her death, only to be checkmated by Karan who is the real mastermind here. Finally, it's the villain only who loses in this chess-like game, not the hero.As said earlier, the title of Humraaz (someone who knows your secret or someone whom you have shared your secret with) has nothing do with the story presented. Though the narrative is very interesting and keep the viewer engrossed, there is nothing like suspense for him. After coming to know of the collusion of Karan and Priya in the scheme of trapping Raj and extorting money from him, whatever little suspense has been there, is also gone and there is hardly any suspense in the post-interval session. The curiosity of the audience regarding the conclusion has been maintained though.The story has been written by taking the basic grains from Alfred Hitchcock's classic movie - Dial M for Murder (1954) which was remade as A Perfect Murder (1998). However the directors appear to be more interested in showing lavishness, remote-control gates, video-conferencing through internet (which was a recent development in the world of technology at the time of this movie), one-way mirrors in bathrooms of the cruise etc than having a good script for the movie, using those basic grains. That's why their grip on the movie gets loosened at many places and the movie could not be as good as it could have been.Technical and production value wise, the movie scores like anything but lavishness leaves a positive impact on the audience only when the script is taut and engaging and Humraaz loses the plot on this count. Raj (Bobby Deol) takes interest less in his business and more in watching nude females through one-way mirrors fitted in their bathrooms. And mind it, he is the hero of this movie. His roaming about the world alongwith his cruise, leaving his vast business behind and leaving his mother in Jaipur (their hometown), also does not make any sense. The lead female character is given the form of a vamp in the major part of the movie but she turns out to be the heroine in the final reels. Changing her infidel and greedy character to that of a devoted wife or Sati Saavitri is sudden and not very convincing.Himesh Reshammia's music contains foot-tapping numbers and can be considered as overall good. Bardaasht Nahin Kar Sakta is my favourite song from this album. Shiraz Ahmed's dialogs are as average as his screenplay is.Performance wise talking, both Bobby Deol and Ameesha Patel are average alongwith the supporting cast members, are average. The real performer in this movie is the villain Akshaye Khanna who has delivered a sensational and convincing performance. He is a talented actor and was able to create his sizable fan-following in the initial years of his career itself. The movie alongwith his role may be considered as ordinary but his performance is extra-ordinary.If you want to watch an Indianized version of Dial M for Murder or A Perfect Murder, I suggest you to watch Mukul S. Anand's Aitbaar (1985) which is a much better adaptation of the classic Hollywood movie (s). Still, courtesy Akshaye Khanna, this Abbas-Mustan presented Bollywood potboiler is also worth a dekko.\n",

Everything in their relationship is picture perfect, till Asha invites Aman to meet her family over dinner. Asha's family goes crazy when they come to know that Aman is a Pakistani. The chaos begins and Aman finds himself in nightmare, which just doesn't seem to be ending!The first half of the movie is a breezy comedy of errors, with some sharp dialogues and funny situations. But second half goes on an entirely different tangent that doesn't tie in with the first half. After a while, the screenplay seems super stretched, with too many pointless sub-plots. Even when the movie is less than two hours one wishes that at least 15 minutes more were edited. Also other than a few dialogues that evoke a hearty laugh rest just fail to make any impact. Performance wise, Kiron Kher steals the show, playing the loud Punjabi paranoid mother with perfect comic timing, barring a few scenes where she overacts Ali Zafar plays himself, a musician from Pakistan, offering nothing new in his poker face type of performance. He still has the natural charm and is likable as the confused, ill-fated Pakistani boyfriend stuck in a crazy situation. Yami Gautam's character, as the Indian Hindu love interest, was poorly written and she did not have much scope to perform. Also, there was no chemistry between Ali and Yami. On the other hand, watching the interactions between Zafar (the damaad) and Kher (the mother-in-law-to- be) together on screen were an absolute delight. Anupam Kher is completely wasted and it is sad to see an actor of his talent play a silly, cameo- ish role in Total Siyapaa. New-find Sara Khan comes across seductive. Other actors were plain and bland.Anupam Kher and his real life wife Kiron Kher play the on screen couple for the first time and their chemistry and pairing has not been properly exploited in the movie. Total Siyapaa has a very telefilm or theatric look and feel and director Eeshwar Nivas has made the entire flick in essentially three sets and the entire cast has donned one outfit throughout. Outcome of a low budget more then the script's demand, because the artists are also badly styled. Music is strictly average and not very memorable - although 'Palat meri jaan' is enjoyable and compliments the plot.Total Siyapaa is really a major chaos. Overall, the best moments from Total Siyapaa were already shown in the snappy promos and a very interesting concept is churned out as strictly average movie lacking charm, spark and humor.\n",

So why should one care for this movie's weaknesses if they can just enjoy its biggest strength? Well, yes, Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge takes inspiration from numerous famous films, it may be annoying, but it works as a film thanks to its comedy which provides quite a few laughs, its light presentation, music and star cast. Salman and Karisma are the lead pair, and they are good looking, funny and charismatic. Karisma is just sizzling every time she appears on-screen. Salman is very good in a role that is actually what he is most used to playing. Three of my favourite actors, Om Puri, Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal play Karisma's loving uncles. All three are fantastic, but the one who delivers the most entertaining performance is Anupam Kher with his gay act. He's hilarious. Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge is nothing exceptional, but it's enjoyable.

This is the story of a young girl who marries into a wealthy family. One day, during the Holi festival she witnesses a horrifying incident of her brother in-law gang-raping the housemaid Umi along with his friends. She cannot get into the closed room, and seeks help from her husband, but the two are too late. When the police comes to interrogate Damini about the physically and emotionally ravaged Umi who lies in hospital, Damini, despite all the pressure coming from her in-laws and her own husband, says the entire truth, and that's how this is taken to court. The story narrates the nightmare Damini goes through only because she is decisively stuck by her stand.Amazingly scripted and aptly executed, Damini shocks you with its unpredictable proceedings and its disturbing and brutally honest portrayal of rape, injustice and social ignorance, without overdoing any scene in this regard. Its main goal, however, is not to portray the society as bad or unfair, but to show the power of one, and in this case, the power of one simple yet strong woman who has nothing but her truth, and who is ready to face the entire world if necessary to go with this very truth. The film is aided by pleasant music, brilliant dialogues, good editing, effective cinematography, but what makes it stand out is of course Rajkumar Santoshi's fantastic direction. Santoshi pulls this project off and delivers a product that is laden with intensity, suspense and entertainment value. He pays attention to details and extracts first-rate performances from his actors and from Meenakshi Sheshadri in particular.Meenakshi Sheshadri, in a role of a lifetime, acts like never before. An actress who was limited to insignificant roles of the wife and the love interest in mindless action films, she is simply outstanding as Damini. She is compelling, intense and very convincing throughout the film. I also liked the \"nervous breakdown\" dance number she did, like the one of Sridevi in Lamhe. This is an exceptional performance. The only other actor who stands out in a big way is Sunny Deol, whose character of the good lawyer comes as a great relief. This is one of his greatest performances. Other cast members include Rishi Kapoor, who makes no impact as 'the husband', Kulbhushan Kharbanda who is good as Rishi Kapoor's father, and Amrish Puri who is as brilliant as always as the corrupted lawyer. Damini is an incredibly interesting, disturbing and ultimately inspiring piece which should not be missed by anyone.\n",

            "Aaja Nachle is Madhuri Dixit's case for still being the best out there. And I'm signed, sealed, and delivered. No one delivers the emotional expression through the entire spectrum the way she does. I just sat there in awe watching her. I guess my standards have slid a bit since she left. But she makes all the competition seem like runners-up to me.I can now say that I think the movie should sweep a lot of awards: It deserves Best Screenplay, Best Musical Director, Best Cinematography, Best Choreography, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Kunal and Konkona, of course). If there was an award for a woman carrying the lead all by herself, there's no question Madhuri Dixit would deserve it. There have only been a few (Nargis, Hema, Shabana) who've been in that elite group. Madhuri belongs there too.There is SO much music and dance in this movie, it is hard to pick a favorite. But as soon as I saw the dancers in red with their hair flying, doing the song about Ishq during the Laila-Majnu play, I knew that I had seen this year's favorite for me. I like them all, especially the traditional one for Aaja Nachle. But the staging, lighting and choreography for this Ishq dance were so DRAMATIC that it stands out.I loved the subplots, like the \"most boring man\" and his wife. The quarreling of Imran and Anokhi. The conflict between the Raja and Dia (Akshaye, a favorite of mine, really gave this movie a nice bit of electricity). And, of course, when they told the story of Laila and Majnu as kids, with her feeling every pain he had and the world tearing them apart, my heart went awwwwwwwwwwwww (not mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this time).Oh, did I mention Best Costume. Madhuri was dressed so nicely! That last one when the play concluded was just gorgeous. I can see that this play would win the hearts of townspeople in a small village.Anyway, EVERYONE should see this movie. I did a 50 mile round trip and this time I don't even regret it. Out of all the movies I've seen this year, this one truly made driving worthwhile.9 out of possible 10\n",

            "Sadma has one of the greatest and most unusual stories ever in an Indian movie. It is well directed, well narrated, and naturally acted. The film has bits of comedy, drama, but it is better described as a realistic, enjoyable and beautiful journey which remains keepsake-less. It lets the viewer experience a real pain on-screen. I'm obviously talking about the climax scene which is so touching that nothing can be good enough to explain what you feel about it. It can be really difficult when an experience of a lifetime, a story of love and a relationship of pure humanity are gone with the wind as if they had never been. I can easily relate to this because I experienced something similar in life. Don't know where the writer had taken his inspiration from to write this extraordinary story and this fine script, but Balu Mahendra must be applauded for handling it so well on-screen. Kamal Haasan and Sridevi are nothing short of spectacular and superb in their respective roles. As the caring and worldly school teacher Somu, Haasan plays his role with depth and visible understanding of his character, and his final scenes are of the film's strongest. Sridevi, in one of her most memorable roles, plays a young woman, who, as a result of a head injury loses her memory and is in a mental state of a five-year old girl's. That means she actually has two roles to play (which this actress has done plenty of times). As the conscious woman before the accident, she is graceful and beautiful, but it is the other role that marks this performance. To play a little girl trapped in a young woman's body must be very difficult for any actor, but Sridevi does it with incredible ease and conviction, making her character both funny and moving. It's extremely difficult to lose someone, but to lose someone who does not even know he may have ever had even an opportunity to interact with you is much more saddening. This is the basic concept of Sadma. All I can say is do yourself a favour and go watch it.\n",

            "Khalnayak is the movie that made Sunjay Dutt into the star he is today. His career is judged as the movies he made before Khalnayak and thereafter. The film is a pop cultural phenomenon in India. All of the songs are still sung today by the children of Bombay. The role of the villian essayed by Dutt is one of the most memorable characters in Indian cinematic history. This is hard to beleive since Dutt is such a wooden actor. The film was quite controversial due to one of its songs and the fact a hero was going to play a evil villian. But Ghai (a mediocre director) pulled off an amazing film with a worthy lesson for the vagrants of India. This movie was one of the decades biggest hits, and will go down in Indian cinema as one of the best action thrillers of all time.\n",

            "Zakhm is, by and large, the finest work of Mahesh Bhatt of the 1990s, a decade throughout which he made some disastrous movies with little substance. Zakhm is a lifelike, wonderful story, which unfolds in two time-lines. The first is the present-day turmoil happening in the life of a young music director named Ajay. He is in a hospital where his mother is lying in a critical condition as a result of recent communal riots in which she was burned by a group of Islamists. The second time-line is presented through a flashback which recounts Ajay's childhood when he lived with his mother and recently-born brother. His father did not live with them and would only come to visit them from time to time. He never married Ajay's mother because he was a Hindu and she was a Muslim. Yet, she kept hiding her Muslim faith because of her involvement with a Hindu man, disguising as a Christian for the rest of her life. Zakhm works because it feels very much a documentation of a true and personal story, and it actually is, from what I understand. It is deeply moving and absorbing, and in this regard is reminiscent of Bhatt's efforts during the 1980s, like Arth, Saaransh and Kaash, some amazing, hard-hitting pictures known for realistically portraying complex relationships and lifelike struggles. Zakhm is not as great as these films, generally speaking, and technically too it could have been better, but then it is definitely a special film in many ways. Bhatt's direction is very good. He tackles a delicate subject which is always relevant and presents a sincere and brutally honest account of communal strife, even if it's faulty and preachy at times. The portrayal of Ajay's childhood and his relationship with his mother is beautiful and heart-touching. Bhatt captures the mind of a troubled child with excruciating authenticity. To achieve the right amount of credibility, the casting was very crucial. And well, no one disappoints. Ajay Devgan is excellent in his first great role. His performance is incredibly heartfelt and intense, and it's memorable more because most of it is internal and non-verbal. His devastated expression of anguish and grief is haunting, to say the least. Pooja Bhatt has never looked more beautiful. She is brilliant as the loving mother and suffering wife, who is tormented by her everyday struggle of raising her kids all alone, hiding her religious identity, and living in distance from her husband. This is certainly her best performance. Child actor Kunal Khemu is quite amazing as the young Ajay, who is a smart kid and a loving son. Sonali Bendre is beautiful and provides good support. Zakhm is not a flawless movie, but it is definitely a moving and riveting movie experience which remains in the mind for a long time.\n",

However The Shaukeens is nothing great in comparison, actually the director keeps the main plot same but changes things to suit today's times.

The 3 meet Lisa Haydon in Mauritius who is upset because of her friends giving more likes to her ex on fb(such jokes) Akshay Kumar enters at the interval and the seocnd half focuses on him trying to please a Bengali Director to get a national award, he also makes fun of himself which is getting boring now, after Srk,Salman doing the same. The film also gets lengthy and stretchedDirection is okay but expected a lot from Abhishek Kapoor who gave us TERE BIN LADEN Music is okayAmongst actors, all 3 being talented yet the chemistry and fun of the original is missing in them. Annu Kapoor is decent in his role, Piyush Mishra rarely seen in such films does well in his role, Anupam Kher being sober does a decent job Lisa Haydon is a non actress, Akshay Kumar plays himself and is okay Manoj Joshi,Cyrus Broacha are good\n",

David Dhawan discovered their perfect chemistry of act & i believe that Chal Mere Bhai was one of the last pictures made with this formal couple.it is a good film with funny & dramatic moments.a typical David Dhawan movie. story of Sapna(Karisma Kapoor)who comes to Mumbai to find a job while she live with his uncle Mamaji(Shakti Kapoor),when she goes for interview she meets Vicky Oberoi(Sanjay Dutt),the serious chairman of the Oberoi's industry company.who does not hire Sapna because she did not arrive in interview in time.& when Sapna meets Vicky's Dad the head boss Balraj Oberoi(Dalip Tahil),he becomes impressed of Sapna and hires her.during all the incidents Oberoi family have another son whose name is Prem(Salman Khan).he is a playboy who wishes to be a superstar.and when he faces Sapna he happens to love her and Sapna loves Prem either.but Vicky suddenly falls in love with Sapna and cause he has lost his girlfriend before,he chooses Sapna's love forever and ever... good story with splendid music and performances.Sanjay Baboo is great.he plays as Vicky as good as it gets.also Salman is great as playboy Prem who finds himself drown in Sapna's love.Karisma is the best of all.she plays the naughty innocent Sapna like spectacular as she is. I regret of why KArisma and Salman don't play in films anymore.they were good couples all the time of modern Bollywood.Alas,nothing stays in good style forever.David Dhawan directs this picture better than his stupid films like:Mr. & Mrs. Khiladi,Bade Miyan Chote Miyan &... this a well made film.think full one with a repeated story but performances terrific.

            "\"Relax. It's nothing\" That's the line you take home after the curtains have come down on DIL DOSTI ETC. Prakash Jha, noted for his hard-hitting films, manages to send home the message loud and clear. That it's for the viewer to make his choices. Whether casual sex is nothing or whether betraying a friend means nothing, or whether adding conquests (read scoring in bed with girls) to your already swollen list means anything to you. Or finally, whether sticking by values instilled in you and standing by principles means anything? The choice is yours. This movie does not preach, it just bares the fact which, sadly cannot be ignored.In that sense this is a good movie. I mean you can only explain the consequences of bad actions to a teenager; at the end you have to respect him/her to make his/her choices.How many films do we see targeted explicitly at the youth/students/college kids? Prakash Jha has found his audience and in director Manish Tiwary manages to tell a decent tale. It's shocking at times yes; but so is reality.\n",

            "In a single statement I would say that this movie is for the Love Fantacised like the Director seems to be is. Only the teenage girls may find some sense and romance in this non-sense people call movie.This movie is a weirdo and I watched this piece of sh*t because of the continued persuasion from my girlfriend and I hated the movie from the very moment it started. The most hateful character in the movie is of Daddu played by Rishi Kapoor. Nobody would like to have an idiot man like him to be his Grandpa (the character). Although Rishi Kapoor played it well, but you will end up hating the character so much that you will feel like head shooting him. In degree of hatefulness, Rishi Kapoor is followed by Bharti Singh. She is portrayed as a slut who teaches Yoga and the humour she created was ridiculously cheap and disgusting. Other characters in this movie were average. In a non-sense movie like this, you have no expectations from the characters. The only thing I liked in the movie were a couple of songs.But the real bullsh*t in the movie is the conceptions it professes. 500 step journey to the true lover's house, the resignation of entire office as a stand against atrocities of their boss, the epic non-sense of donation of heart (which is actually a murder by a doctor violating the Right to Life under Article 21 of the constitution of India), etc. made me hate this movie so much that I could not keep my anger in control. But, I enjoyed being with my girlfriend and didn't made her feel that I was annoyed, but, I will never go again to watch any love fantasized movie.\n",

            "Pyaar to hona hi tha (\"Love had to happen\") is a well-done, very close remake of Lawrence Kasdan's French Kiss for an Indian audience. As such, it's an enjoyable, lightweight, fluffy, if inconsequential comedy which, despite its sometimes garish use of colours certainly has its moments and is at times even better than the original.Ajay Devgan and Kajol share much better chemistry than Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan (they got married pretty soon afterwards). Devgan's thug is a lot slicker than Kline's, and his moustache is much superior. Meg Ryan played her character in a cute, whiny, bratty way, whereas Kajol is equally cute in a more wacky, goofy way. Jean Reno was pretty good as the police officer, but Om Puri is even better.Whereas casting and character interplay are actually better in this remake, technically the American original is, of course, much superior. Some of the continuity problems and location inconsistencies are downright annoying. I also don't find the slapstick scenes (like the airplane scene) too funny, but thankfully there's only a few of them.Overall a very enjoyable movie, especially if compared to the original.\n",

            "Puri Jagannath's 'Bbuddah Hoga Tera Baap' is a celebration of Amitabh Bachchan's iconic status, particularly of his angry young man image that was immensely popular in the 80s. As much I disliked most of those movies from the 80s, I thoroughly enjoyed this film from the start. Furthermore, even though it's a tribute to Bachchan and pays homage, none of it is overdone or thrown in your face. It is all done in an entertaining and amusing fashion. The action scenes are over the top and silly but also very funny immediately reminding the viewer of those silly Bachchan films. Shot with style and colour, the film looks 'cool'. Think of this as a remake of an 80s Bachchan flick that is well updated and funny. The humour works very well. The dialogues are hilarious as they parody the 80s masala flicks.Amitabh Bachchan delivers a completely laidback performance. Even though 'Bbuddah Hoga Tera Baap' is a celebration of his angry young man image, he appears completely relaxed and delivers a natural performance and reminding the viewer again of his flair for comedy. Sonu Sood is well cast as he very much resembles a young Amitabh and is competent. Even though she has a tiny role, Ravishing Raveena Tandon is superb as the hot sexy mom who is completely nuts about Bachchan's Vijju. She provides some laugh out loud comic relief. Elegant Hema Malini adds grace and class. The two young actresses are passable and Prakash Raj is brilliant as the over-the-top villain.Overall, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. The title already suggests that. It's easily watchable with the family, as a date movie or a rainy day flick with a glass of fresh drinks. The references also give it nostalgic value. Just sit back, relax and let the film start as its maker welcomes you to share this celebration of an actor who has made a solid place for himself in the history of Bollywood.\n",

            "Well it seems like Dance movies are the rage these days, and this week alone we have two films that seemingly centers on dance, with Jump coming from China/Hong Kong, and Chance Pe Dance from Bollywood, both being romantic comedies appealing to their respective distinct demographics. And it's not too surprising that unlike dance films of old where there's a male-female pair who would exhibit some signature moves on the dance floor, the contemporary films this week have absolutely none of that, which in some ways is a pity.Chance Pe Dance follows recent Bollywood films such as Luck Pe Chance in having their characters lament about the open secret of their film industry, where one has to be well connected, or come from an influential family in the industry in order to have one's big break served on a silver platter. For the rest of the mortals aspiring for that opportunity, it's more hard work, toil and sweat in order to get noticed, otherwise it's an endless cycle of mundane work to pay the bills, and juggling auditions in between.Shahid Kapur plays one such struggler from Delhi, Sameer Behl, who has spent the last 3 plus years trawling the audition houses of Mumbai in order to find work in the film industry. Living under meagre terms, he gets disappointed time and again, which is pretty much against the way he was brought up to believe that his good looks and charisma automatically meant he'd be the hero in his life, all the time. The narrative takes a very whirlwind snapshot of Sameer's life, highlighting his debts and being played out by both his best friend as well as filmmakers who promise him the sky, but never hesitant to pull the rug from under his feet.The story tries to jam pack too many subplots into the film, which makes you wonder whether this is a dance film if at all. First of all, there's the school days arc, where in order to sustain his city living, Sameer takes up a teaching job, imparting his dance skills to pesky children (he's never good with them) in order to help them win their dance competition. The key message here is of course if one couldn't do anything with one's current lifetime, there's always the imparting of skills to the next generation for them to live the dream that we have missed out on. This story arc could have been better fleshed out, other than to be squeezed into the film just before the intermission, and then resolved right after the film resumes.Then there's the continuation of Sameer's own struggle, where he has to learn never to give up because a life-changing opportunity may just be around the corner. In what would be like an American Idol clone of a dance/idol contest, this story too wasn't fleshed out properly and we're taken in for quite the fast tracking from the competition's start, right to the finale, with nary any tension due to the lack of competitive characters, and the larger culprit being the lack of dance (it's chance pe dance after all, right?)But the largest waste here was the under utilization of the character Tina, played by Genelia D'Souza, a choreographer whom Sameer serendipitously meets, and falls in love with. The character reminded me of Asin's Kalpana from Ghajini, the free-spirited, strong girl who teaches a thing or two to her guy about what it means by being resilient. I thought Genelia looked like Asin too from certain angles, and possessed the same vivacity here as well, together with some really stunning dance moves that we would see at the start of the film, with so much promise that when the lead duo gets paired together, sparks will fly and magic will happen. But it didn't! If there's anything to rue about, it's precisely this missed opportunity to have the duo perform a lot more dance numbers than one which quite sedately celebrates their love for each other, by mucking around exotic locales.For a dance movie, I wouldn't doubt that Bollywood cannot pull one off, given the musical like quality in almost all of the films, but it's a real pity that Chance Pe Dance is not that film. Thankfully the leads have charisma and share pitch perfect chemistry together, which managed to carry the film through from start to end, limited dance moves notwithstanding.\n",

            "NTJNH is Arjun Sablok's first feature film. And it's a pretty good debut. The first half hour is the weakest part of the film, with a song that should be cut, too slow a pace and some tired Bollywood antics. But then the film gets momentum and starts to deliver. There are still lesser moments that pay unnecessary tribute to the 'formula' (silly comedy bits, a clichéd gay character, a hero-beats-up-multiple-adversaries scene...) but they are outweighed by moments which show that the director has at times a firm grip on the various aspects of cinematic expression and uses his tools to good effect (camera, editing, sound effects). There is a delightful party dancing scene which has only one fault, it's too short. There is an equally effective scene involving a zipper. There is a comic scene that makes fun of Bollywood film making which directly leads into the inevitable declaration of love between hero and heroine and its expression in a song number, all elegantly executed. Also impressive is the scene around the intermission and the tell-me-your-name-scene which culminates in a wedding song, to name two more examples. Technically the film is uneven like almost all Bollywood films. Sharp shots and out of focus and filtered shots follow each other in random fashion, without a recognizable concept. Color balance is off at times. Both can be seen on the DVD as well as on 35mm prints. The 3 leads are all doing a good job. Hrithik Roshan tends to overact in comic scenes, but is on the other hand excellent in dramatic and emotional moments. Esha Deol has not got beauty queen looks, but something better instead: personality and charm. She has got talent. Saif Ali Khan plays once more a playboy, which he can do on autopilot by now. He's good as well. The film is above average but suffers somewhat from using Bollywood cliches and a not terribly original story, a variation of so many other Bollywood love stories. On the other hand the basic conflict is well established, the drama works and the execution with a good cast lifts the material often on the level of solid workmanship and a few times beyond.\n",

            "KATTI BATTI - Nikhil Advani debuted in Bollywood under Karan Johar with one of my most favorite movie Kal Ho Na Ho. Then he goes on making 3-4 just average movies . Then he made a gripping thriller D- DAY , then he again goes to the mode of making below average films. This time its back to back in two weeks. Although i haven't seen last week's HERO but its response and its current IMDb rating (4/10) pretty much makes it clear that its a bad film. Same goes for Katti Batti. If you have seen the Hollywood flick 500 Days of Summer (which is actually a great romantic film) from which the whole concept of Katti Batti (except the last 20min twist) has been inspired and If you have seen Sweet November (which although not a great film but is better then Katti Batti) from which the last 20 min twist has been copied (oops it was a spoiler), then there left nothing for you in this flick. I cant understand that , is our writers are so bad that when they mix a great Hollywood movie with an above average Hollywood movie the result is actually a below average Bollywood movie. And Kangna Ranawat was so badly wasted , we didn't even get any long scenes of her to look into her acting until the last 20mins. Its not her fault that her character has not given that space and time so she can show her caliber , but its totally her fault that she selected this movie for herself. I don't want to start about Imran Khan . He is portraying the same character again and again (Ek Mein Aur Ek Tu , Gori Tere Pyaar Mein and now this) still he is not getting better in this. I don't even want to remember how bad he act when he does something else. Supporting cast are not interesting enough to discuss either. Editing of the movie was bad. The juggling between the scenes were confusing. When ever Imran starts to think about the past , after the past scene end we always found him in a new place not where he started remembering the past. So we have to remember every time where exactly the present scene was left. Direction was bad too , scenes don't have the finishing touch , were done half heartedly. Its like Nikhil was busy making too films together (Hero and Katti Batti) so he didn't gave his concentration to either of them. I must say like this Nikhil Advani will never able to make his own place in Bollywood. Shockingly songs are also forced in the movie. Infect just before the twist there was a song Jaago Mohan Pyaare which feels like director was ringing alarm for the persons who slept while watching the film. And after all of this boring flick when the twist came to tackle you , you were already so bored that no twist can make you bring your interest back.. Nikhil we want more Kal Ho Na Ho and D Days , not Hero or Katti Batti. Please don't be so desperate in making movies. 5.3/10. By ANuP APu KuMaM.\n",

            "Dolly Ki Doli had an simple yet interesting premise. A con-woman Dolly (Sonam Kapoor) entraps and marries men only to run away with all valuables of the groom and his family. To setup and arrange these fake marriage she has a whole fake family along with her. Sonu (Rajkummar Rao) a jatt farmer who seems to be truly in love with her becomes one such victim. Then after an item number and couple of more fake marriages later is the turn of Manjot (Varun Sharma). There is very less light shed on why this con gang pull-of so many heists yet live a mediocre life. The characters seemed to have zero motivation towards whatever they were doing. Anyways, not all is well when finally after dozens of fake marriages the police comes to know about the gang and a cop (Pulkit Samrat) decides to take up the case because of a some evident personal reason. After few months thanks to Saif Ali Khan's cameo character, when the cop and the bride finally meet face-to- face we have all the clichéd melodrama and even more illogicality with the ending than what had already been portrayed. Anyways its always hard to pull of a credible ending for such con comedy premises.On the positive side, Dolly Ki Doli is briskly based, it just flies off from the word go. Some times the editing felt too choppy but I will appreciate them for keeping it under 100 minutes. This is the basic thing most Bollywood films fail to get right and have overblown run time with very little substance. Debut director Abhishek Dogra keeps the atmosphere light, not to be taken seriously and even satirical at times until the last act. The script is full of illogical behaviors and plot holes, but if you can ignore that then the comedy might be enjoyable. But I myself did not find it hilarious. The comic timing was terrible plus the characters were interesting yet poorly written. Acting wise, all three males Rajkummar,Varun and Pulkit do a commendable job. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand was quite unbearable. Her acting was okayish, but it was the character of Dolly which was utter nonsense. The same old innocent-pretty girl is terribly overdone which made her look annoying plus it is highly unbelievable that so many men fell into her trap so easily. Also we annoying songs and an item number stuffed in just for the sake of it, which had nothing new. Overall, I will say Dolly Ki Doli is a nice and non-formulaic attempt which is appreciable. But it is heavily flawed and has poor dialogues. This ride can be moderately enjoyable only if don't care much about the characters and keep your brains at home. Still, it is highly avoidable.RATING: [1.5/5]\n",

            "Making a good horror movie is a tough job. Modern day digitally connected, and increasingly rational audience is notoriously demanding fresh takes at traditional horror concepts. This is also leading to fusion of genres. Ragini MMS2 is one such genre mix- horror and sex. I know Balaji Telefilms has taken it upon them to be \"bold\" but a movie such as this starring a porn star in and as a porn star is questionable. The original Ragini MMS had some amount of originality- a couple unknowingly going to a haunted house to shoot a MMS and becoming the target of an evil spirit. In a recent interview, Sunny is quoted to have said that directors approach her with scripts just to find a reason to meet her. Parvin Dabas plays one such sleazy director, who comes up with this brilliant idea of shooting a movie based on the plot of the first movie, at the same spooky house. He also wants real actors, not big stars and strangely so, he selects the one actor who has made a career out of faking it, as the lead. Rest of the plot is a lift from the recently released The Conjuring- creaky house, an angry poltergeist, possession, levitating chairs, missing children, human sacrifice, a tree hanging, the spirit embodied in an object from the past- all is been there done that category.It is a known fact that clothes and Sunny do not like each other. So much to the satisfaction of front row whistle blowers, all throughout the movie, she features in various stages of undress. At one point, Sunny says that she wants to research for her role. To which the director pulls out an epic quote- \"Porno se Rituporno kab ban gayi\". In many ways, this statement sums up Sunny's real life quest for respect in the acting world. But can the audience ever stop objectifying her? Surely, not when she is thrusting out her assets at the slightest instance, and indulging in sex in the lake, in the bedroom, in the bathroom, and in the rain.And surprisingly though, she acts pretty well, especially considering how insipidly written the other characters are. Director Bhushan Patel ensures that decent actors like Sandhya Mridul, Dabas, and Divya Dutta come out unintentionally funny. Divya Dutta is an incredible character in herself- she is a psychiatrist who moonlights as an exorcist! The crazy cinematography has ghosts appearing in almost every alternate frame, but with no sense of drama and hence leaves little impact. Even her porn movies have seen better direction. So ultimately you only get to do the guy thing and admire Leone's body. So there it is- baby doll and bottles of vodkas notwithstanding, Ragini MM2 is generic horror, devoid of logic and scares, it is little more than an uninhibited skin show. But maybe that's something deep down in our hearts we actually wanted- 4/10\n",

            "First thing first which strike at the beginning of the film is that Dharmendra at the age of 73 looks amazing. Story is equally strong as the star cast.Perfact way to bring 3 deols together. A impulsive and ambitious boxer want to fulfill his dream to become first world heavy weight boxing champion form India.When he cant(due to false doping charges) he tries to achieve it by his elder son who finally refuse to box as the game has no importance in the country and one can't feed their family with it. For the sake of family he disappoint his father.The younger son is handicap so he want to box but he can't.There are very nice twist and turns in the film. Relationship between Sunny and Dharmendra is excellent. The great point of the film is that here, sons try their best to achieve their father's dream.Reason of Sunny to fight at the climax is also convincing and touchy,Film is little lengthy and has some unnecessary melodrama and unwanted stage song of Bobby. But it also has some emotional and touchy scenes of Dharmendra with Kiron Kher and Sunny .One can say this time son has relaunch their father in a big way. Its definitely better than \"rocky Balboa \" as it has great emotional value and better reason to fight. Must see .\n",

            "Being Cyrus is a wonderful and intense psychological drama. It is a dark, comic, urbane and very interesting film about a young man who shows up on the doorstep of a dysfunctional Sethna family, led by a carefree sculptor named Dinshaw, who Cyrus claims to be a fan of. That's where he resides, working as Dinshaw's apprentice and assistant. Cyrus gets close to Dinshaw's adulterous and impulsive wife Katy. Through his narration and their relations the story presents us the other half of the family living in an old dilapidated building in Mumbai - Dinshaw's brother Farookh, who lives with his young bride Tina and their father Fardon, a neglected old man who is badly maltreated by his son. Thrown between these two families, Cyrus has to materialise a plan, which seems to be quite evident throughout the movie but is revealed only towards the end. The mystery is not solved until the film's final scenes. An engagingly complicated and twisted script is the strongest link of Being Cyrus. The film is riveting, symbolic and straight to the point. It is not your run-of-the-mill Bollywood film, it is a different and fresh product which celebrates its uniqueness, and that's one of the things it must be applauded for. Cyrus is a young sophisticated man whose silence often says more than his actual words. Saif Ali Khan brilliantly displays this aspect of Cyrus's nature. His narration is also very effective. Naseeruddin Shah does not disappoint in a greatly restrained act, but he actually does not have that much to work with. Dimple Kapadia, though very sexy as the neurotic Katy, is surprisingly disappointing and at times her acting looks forced. Boman Irani is excellent in his role. Simone Singh does very well, too. To sum it up, Being Cyrus is a fun watch. It is intelligently written and well directed, and it is only one hour and 25 minutes long, quite an exception.\n",

They decide to move from Melbourne to Singapore where Samir hopes to restart his career. Certain things happen, and as a result Raina remains behind in Melbourne, with Samir promising to return for her. She takes a job and makes new friends, one of which, Akash (Sohail Khan) falls in love with her. With the help of his friend Arsh (Yash Tonk), Akash sets about to woo her and discredit Samir.This romance has a good, if predictable, plot that nicely combines humor with drama. The songs are good, some especially so. Kapoor is sometimes stiff, but Sohail Khan has good energy and gives a good performance. Salman Khan's role is brief and two-dimensional, and he doesn't give much emotion to it. On the whole, while it's not an exceptional film, it gives good entertainment.Special appearances by Preity Zinta and Deepika Padukone.\n",

            "A project completely dependent upon the already famous comic persona of TV actor-anchor, Manish Paul, MICKEY VIRUS is a fairly entertaining film if we keep aside its awkward and unconvincing climax ruining the fine build-up. It has an enjoyable first half, mostly providing the funny moments through its Computer-ish dialogues, having a strong youth appeal using the Delhi ambiance, which also lacks the perfection as seen in VICKY DONOR). Yes, the humour element in it takes a back seat since the film turns into a thrilling crime mystery post interval, still the racy pace doesn't let you feel the missing factor and the new twists in the story line keep the interest alive. However as the secret is revealed, it doesn't turn out to be that convincing or hard hitting at all, hampering the overall impact of an engrossing watch as it ends.Thankfully made on a fresh subject, the film begins on a shaky note but then goes on to deliver the promised humor constantly, mainly through its well written lines. Revolving around a computer hacker caught in a messy trap, it has some cool graphics, better than many other films of the past using the same element. At times romance disturbs the progression but the justification arrives later as the con begins and there are very few drops in its narration before the long climax. Both the background score & cinematography keep the energy going along with a few above average songs including \"Sajna Ve\".As expected, Manish Paul impressively is the part of almost all the entertaining sequences of the film and he once again proves his excellent comic timing in its debut film too. Elli Avram looks stunning but doesn't get much to do as per the script (except serving the glamour quotient of the film, as required). Out of the friendly group, Puja Gupta gets the maximum scenes and she is fine, whereas Raghave Kakkar, Vikesh Kumar and Nitesh Pandey (Professor) are just all right. Manish Chaudhari repeatedly delivers a similar kind of act as seen in his previous films but the one actor who comes up as a clear winner among the supporting cast is Varun Badola, who is simply lovable as the assisting inspector.As the first notable attempt from director Saurabh Varma, MICKEY VIRUS mainly scores for its novel subject, well worked upon lingo, entertaining first half and Manish Paul. However with a different & severely edited climax it could have been a much better venture for sure. Also with a subject majorly dealing with the city culture (hugely dependent on gadgets), it is going to find fewer takers in the interiors and smaller centers. So keeping this fact and the film's fresh, out of the routine subject in mind, I would like to rate it as a nice, well attempted metro entertainer, just missing the target due to its final reels.\n",

The film has a very simple story and yet you are completely engaged with the characters and their journeys. The two leads play struggling screen writing partners who are constantly aspiring to reach the \"next level\" in their careers- and you completely feel for them. The lead girl (who was earler seen in Talaash) is gorgeous. There are also some cameos by Bollywood insiders who spoof themselves in a sporty way. The best part about this film is that it is not trying hard to make you laugh or make a point. It is breezy, light and funny. This is the kind of film that makes you want more and the kind of fresh Indian cinema that I would like to watch more often.\n",

            "I've been following the films made by Ashutosh Gowariker, who has helmed huge epics and worked with the biggest names in Bollywood today, such as Lagaan with Amir Khan, Swades with Shah Rukh Khan, and his previous film Jodhaa Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Ashwarya Rai Bachchan. And it's a fact that his films have runtimes of about 3.5 hours, which goes by real quickly as he keeps the story engaging, and the production values for this films are nothing less than magnificent. So naturally my interest was piqued as the auteur has now turned his sights on a romantic comedy, and I wonder exactly how a filmmaker such as he would be able to tackle this mass-appeal genre.Based on the novel \"Kimbali Ravenswood\" by Madhu Rye, What's Your Rashee? (or translated as star sign for the English speaking audience) has all the ingredients that would allow for the runtime to stretch to a typical Gowariker length, but that's only because the challenge is to present all 12 female characters representing their respective star signs with attempts at equal runtime for each, with a song being inserted during the whirlwind courtship, clocking 13 tunes when the typical production averages 5. Think of it as an extreme speed dating where we get to know the opposite sex in some detail, with some travelling involved as the production showcased different districts in Mumbai, which of course is an eye-opener for one who has never visited India, yet.The story's actually nothing sophisticated, and by romantic comedy standards quite predictable at times. Basically Yogesh Patel (Harman Buweja), an Non-Resident Indian living in Chicago has been summoned back to India because his parents learnt of his multi-million dollar inheritance from his grandfather should he get married, and the family now needs that kind of money to pay off his brother's debts. He reluctantly agrees of course, and sets himself up to meet initially hundreds of girls, but inspiration struck and he decided that he should be 12, one maiden under each star sign.The main draw of the film is of course actress Priyanka Chopra, who has taken on possibly her most challenging film to date, playing 12 characters with more than 12 personalities. Why I say this is because some of her characters are putting on a facade, thus allowing more room for Priyanka to showcase her acting chops, which she did, with the help of stylists decking her out in beautiful dresses, varying make up, wigs, contact lenses and prosthetics even. That's only the physical outlook – you would be amazed at the physical presentation at how chameleon-like this ex-Miss World can be – and she takes her roles on with gusto to make you feel with some, laugh at some, and endear towards some through some wonderful pieces of acting. Not to mention that she broke the record set by Kamal Hassan, who tackled 10 characters in his movie Dasavatharam.Unfortunately for Harman Baweja, who's in need for a booster to his fledging career after the flop Love Story 2050 (which incidentally also co-starred Priyanka), and the lacklustre Victory, his role as Yogesh, quite obsessed with doing the right thing each time, finds himself constantly upstaged and overshadowed by Priyanka's performance. It's a little pity of course, given that if it's anyone who can help him it'll likely be Gowariker given the director's strengths, but this was not to be as it's pretty much the leading lady's vehicle. But that's not to mean that Gowariker's film here is without flaws. Amongst his works to date, I feel that this was perhaps the weakest of the lot, suffering from a number of subplots which provided nothing more than a distraction to the meat of the story, such as that involving the infidelity of his uncle and marriage-consultant (Darshan Zariwala), and that of the loansharks who pop up now and then for unnecessary comic relief.However, its strengths more than compensated for its drawbacks, such as how Priyanka just ran with her opportunities to shine, 12 times. The story also provided some insights into how arranged marriages, with dowries and all, are still conducted and quite a cultural thing, and the plights that some family face with having too many daughters, and wondering how best to have them married off. As the encounters with the different women were rather stand- alone, each allowed for the examination of traits and characteristics that will make you love, or loathe, and generally applies across the board, which allows you to identify with such instances.But for all its narrative twists in secrets that cannot be kept, for its fleeting discussions on honesty or lack thereof, what I enjoyed most was the quasi-explanation of why the females that Yogesh meets, all share a striking resemblance with one another, which other characters don't seem to agree with, but only to the male protagonist. I liked how it was mentioned that we all have this preconceived idea of how our soul mate would preferably look like, and from then we tend to project this thought onto whomever we think would have a chance with, or at least tend to take those physical bits into consideration, only for their inner character, when revealed, to be anything but adhering to our dreams.What's Your Raashee? for the romantic in me, worked wonders, and will leave you guessing at the end just who Yogesh would end up with, since Gowariker deliberately kept you hanging in suspense for as long as he possibly could. I'd recommend it as a date movie anytime if you're looking for something different from the usual Hollywood fare. Just remember to empty your bladders before the show starts, or you'll have to plan to hit the loo just about the time Leo gets introduced, for that inbuilt intermission.\n",

            "Definitely Sanjay Leela Bhansali's first and finest, Khamoshi relates the story of a deaf couple and their relationship with their caring and loving daughter, Annie who is not deaf and whose greatest love is music. The film involves many conflicts resulting from this difference between Annie and her parents and her relationship with a young musician. The film's strength lies in the marvelous script, the exceptional performances, and the paradox of deaf parents whose daughter aspires to become a singer. Bhansali's direction is outstanding and evidently perfectionist; he pays attention to the smallest of details, he knows how and when to excite. This is one of the greatest first-time works by a director. The dialogues are brilliant, the proceedings are unexpected and serious, the depiction is simple and realistic, and the narrative style is very good as well. Bhansali's way of portraying relationships is very impressive, whether it's Annie's relationship with her parents or her beloved Raj, whether it's her dad Joseph's relationship with her mom Flavy, or her family's relationships with close friends and neighbours like Marry and Willie. The film is filled with many great moments, many heart-breaking and many heart-warming sequences. It has romance, drama and even comedy, and most importantly, it has music. And what a music it is. Every song is pure magic and is effectively pictured on-screen. \"Yeh Dil Sun Raha Hai\" is beautiful and touching, \"Aaj Main Upar\" is energetic and is wonderfully sung by Kavita Krishnamurthy, and other songs, including the melancholic \"Bahon Ke Darmiyan\", are equally memorable. The background score is another integral aspect of the film's mood.Bhansali extracts some of the best performances from each and every actor of the unit. The film belongs to Manisha who is astonishing and intense in one of the finest performances we've seen in mainstream Hindi cinema. She carries every scene brilliantly and acts with great conviction. Striking a balance between restraint and temperamental emotion, she delicately lets us sense the struggle, the confusion, the pain and the suffering of a girl who is torn between her love for her parents and her love for music. One must note her breakdown when she is thrown off home by her father and starts a long monologue behind the door, screaming and using sign language, while her father can neither see nor hear her. I could really feel her pain and anger. It was sincere, heart-breaking and powerful. Nana Patekar and Seema Biswas offer a credible chemistry. They really look like a loving married couple who go through the bad and the good just as it comes. Patekar is, once again, simply astounding as the proud, decisive, happy, kind-hearted and loving Joseph. Damn what a performance, so natural and real, and so well infused with sensibility, honesty and humour. Biswas is nothing short of spectacular in this role. Her acting is superb, and she gives an excellently balanced, compelling and moving portrayal of a woman who suffers from her handicaps but still loves life. Salman Khan plays his relatively small yet significant part with sincerity and spontaneity and lends some comic relief with his feel-good character and strong screen presence. Helen is splendid as the lovely and frank Marry, admirably managing to make a remarkable impact with only a few brief scenes. Raghuvir Yadav provides great support as Willie. The girl who plays the young Annie is adorable, and boy does she resemble Manisha (another proof to Bhansali's exemplary craft).All in all, Khamoshi: The Musical is a must-watch. Made with simplicity, graciousness and artistry, it does not go overboard and does not try to overdo or misuse its sensitive subject, and that's the reason it is so touching, powerful and poignant. The film flows very well though it may not appeal to everyone as it's a bit dark and too cruel in some portions, but it will definitely be appreciated for its brilliance and remarkable emotions even by those who perceive it to be overly serious. I personally find it beautiful, crafted, optimistic, entertaining and unforgettable. A real gem.\n",

            "The 80s is known as one of the worst decade for Indian 'masala' films. However, there are a few exceptions and 'Sharaabi' is one of them. While watching the movie one ought to keep in mind that 'Sharaabi' is a 'masala' movie and thus it ought not to be taken too seriously (a mistake many have made). It has all the masala ingredients that make a successful entertainer.Prakash Mehra's screenplay is quite interesting. It is overall melodramatic but on a level that works. Kader Khan's dialogues are outstanding. This multitalented individual, known mostly for his comedic acting talent creates his words with a mix of philosophy, poetry and humour.Then there's Bappi Lahiri's memorable soundtrack with its catchy tunes and fantastic lyrics. The soundtrack is an eclectic mixture of different kinds of songs. Before rewatching it recently, I had last seen the film more than 20 years ago but the songs still stayed in mind. My favourite track is 'Inteha Hogayi Intezaar Ki' while 'Jahan Chaar Yaar', 'Tujhe Naulakkha' and 'De De Pyaar De' are a few nostalgic numbers that brought a smile. The songs are nicely visualized such that they are amusing and captivating (mostly because of Jaya's beauty) and appear during suitable moments of the film. There's also a hilarious item song with Smita Patil.Amitabh Bachchan succeeds in portraying an alcoholic spoilt brat. Vicky couldn't have been an easy part to play and many Hindi film actors tend to go over the top in portraying a drunken man but Bachchan balances it well. Om Prakash delivers a moving performance and Pran plays his part to the T. Jaya Prada is a sight to behold and she reminds the viewer that she's a good actress and an incredibly graceful dancer.'Sharaabi' is about 3 hours of entertainment. What makes this one particularly stand out are the dialogues and music. The performances and Jaya Prada's beauty are a bonus. This is proof further that there are a few worthwhile masala films of the 80s.\n",

            "In the career of every celebrated artist there is one work of art which stands above all others, one that is celebrated as the pinnacle of artistry, the apex to which all that preceded it has led, and against which all that follows will forever be compared. \"Lamhe\" is that performance in the gallery of Sridevi's great acting achievements: indeed, it is THE masterpiece in her repertoire. Of all the films ever made by Sridevi, \"Lamhe\" is (and shall likely remain) the greatest film of her career. Since its release, critics have universally praised the film, and upon viewing it, one cannot help but submit that the praise is rightfully deserved. While \"Sadma\" has been called the definitive performance of her career, there is a strong case to be made that 'the performance' of her career is that of \"Lamhe\".Though the film was deemed too 'risqué' for the average film-goer (its first issue to cinema halls was an abysmal financial disaster) it remains the most bold and uncompromising love story ever made in India. Here for the first time in India's long and sordid celluloid history, we witness the consummation of a highly unconventional relationship between Pooja (Sridevi) and Viren (Anil Kapoor), a man twenty-five years her senior who had himself been in love with Pooja's mother, Pallavi (also Sridevi) who was herself a decade older than Viren. Therein lies the incestuous shadow which has forever made viewers both weary and fearful of \"Lamhe\" and its fiercely non-conformist morality. One critic has written that, \"Viren was not only the father figure in her orphaned life, he was the man who could have been her father if her other had reciprocated his ardour. But for Pooja, bred on Viren's intermittent visits to his ancestral property in Rajasthan, there was no distinction between Prince Charming and this long-distance godfather. Hers was the love that knew no barriers. Neither spatial, nor temporal, nor of age. Even the knowledge of her beloved's repressed passion for her deceased mother did not act as a deterrent. For Viren, too, the initial shock of discovering an unconventional emotion was gradually replaced by self-analysis, introspection, and self-discovery.\" Yash Chopra recalled that when he first screened the film prior to its release, \"the response was ecstatic, but many who saw it advised me to change the ending. They said it would be a big hit with a conventional happy ending. I said if I change the ending, there's no point in making the film.\" \"Lamhe\" is the pinnacle in bold and sensitive film-making, so incomparably replete with the message that love knows no limits, that pain and passion have no boundaries, that it reveals a revolutionary maturity of expression far beyond the conventional clichés of love stories. \"Lamhe\" is a fiercely unconventional film, standing in defiance of the totalitarian ideas of what is and what is not Love. Its theme of transgenerational romance, under the very heavy and unsettling shadow of incest, have made it a litmus test of our moral tendencies and artistic liberties. Traditionalists watching the film will find its theme difficult to digest\"How can any woman find love with a man who loved her mother?\" they ask.But the film begs us to understand that one can love in different ways, and for Viren the passion he has for Pallavi is his first real love of anything that dared to exist on its own terms, human or otherwise. Raised in very polite but stoic English society which has made him hopelessly sheltered, Viren is used to things and people being of the 'proper' sort. When he is confronted by Pallavi, he is entirely smitten by her exotic charms, her chaotic wildness, her absolute connection to the world in which she lives, a notion of which Viren knows nothing about. He is seduced and enchanted by this exotic figure, but her regard for him is that of a foreigner who has come to reacquaint himself with his roots. Many years later, the experience is echoed in Pooja's upbringing: lonely and isolated, she somehow manages to recall her mother's wondrous spirit, and then lays the memories of Viren's past squarely in front of him.Whatever assessment of the film one chooses to make, the brilliance of its performances cannot be denied or overstated. Anil Kapoor has never delivered a more accomplished or subtle performance. Viren is etched with such finesse and delicacy that it is his heartbreak which becomes our own. Waheeda Rehman gives a heartbreaking and heartwarming portrayal of Daija, Viren's maternal confidante and caregiver who plays the same role in orphaned Pooja's upbringing. Anupam Kher is riotously funny as Prem, Viren's only real friend, a sort of elder brother who understands Viren better than Viren will ever understand himself. It must be said, however, that all of these exceptional performances are given to balance the duality of Sridevi's brilliance: she is literally awe-inspiring in a double role which transcends anything India has ever put on the big screen. The mother-daughter characters are inverse reflections of one another, and are played in such distinct fashion that one never feels one character intruding into the other, a perennial fear of actors playing multiple roles in one film. One prominent reviewer probably said it best in her review: \"Sridevi does not enact a performance in 'Lamhe'. She becomes an incarnation of two women whose lives (and deaths) are bound by the nature of Love. Sridevi has pushed the limits of acting with 'Lamhe', and like the film, she has decided that there are no limits.\" There are a great many treasures in the cannon that calls itself Hindi Cinema, but none more resplendent, more wondrous, more beautiful or more painful than \"Lamhe\". This is a film that challenges, both artistically and morally, and has emerged as an unforgettable and unmatched work of human artistry.\n",

Like, really? This apparent randomness wouldn't have been such a deterrent if the plot had some meat to it because Nawaz is quite capable of carrying a film on his own. But within a few minutes, we know that it is a David-Goliath clash between a 'sadak-chaap' fellow and a suited-booted character. The novelty of it being played out on a golf course dissipates in a few rounds, and it becomes the usual 'tamasha' between goons and good 'uns, and haves and have-nots, its good-natured daftness drowning in silliness. There's a 'message' that's dinned in to us via Nawaz's 'ordinary' man. That no one, even a guy who hawks undergarments at a road-side stall, is worthy of contempt. That golf may be seen as a sport for the wealthy, but there's no stopping anyone from becoming a champion. All you need is skill. And will.

It is not as if a rogue neighbor or a local goon was kicking them off their property (and they didn't own the house either; the King did!]). It was a freaking partition of the country! And they weren't the only ones being marginally inconvenienced. Millions of people lost their homes and life savings; hundreds of thousands lost their lives because they couldn't escape early enough. Why did the ladies want to live there? They weren't leaving their farms behind. They could continue with their profession wherever they relocated! Second, the two gentlemen assigned to put a fence along the partition line - what was so compelling that they couldn't move the partition line by 100 meters so the house would safely fall in either of the countries? The ladies did not care if they were in India or Pakistan - all they wanted was live where they were and continue with their lives. What was so important that the country line had to be drawn through their house? What was so important about that piece of land that made it more important than the tens of lives they were willing to sacrifice? There are reasons why people prefer to fight for their rights even at the cost of their lives. And there are principles folks follow even if it costs lives. But neither of these seemed like a valid reason in the story.\n",

This is the worst kind of comedy!!Obvious unintelligent double meaning jokes which back in 8th grade too would barely make me chuckle.I was high (yes, that was a factor in why we decided to go for the movie in the 1st place) when i went in for the movie, and all i could think of during the movie was my rotting brain-cells.The only plus of the movie was Sunny Leone.....u can like her or love her, but u just can't hate her. Even with her terrible acting, this bombshell of a woman just can't be overlooked.The only parts i liked were of her in sexy getup's (don't judge me i'm just a guy....programmed by nature to get attracted to the attractive ones from the opposite sex)In case you decide to still go for the movie or have already had the misfortune of watching it, you have my condolences\n",

            "Ajay Devgan's directorial debut U, Me Aur Hum is quite interesting for its light and colourful background. But despite a promising combination of romance and drama, beautiful locations and two great actors who are perfect for their respective parts, it loses itself. It is lost within all the unnecessary jokes, the confusing flashbacks and the ever-changing sequences from present to past and vice-versa. It's a good story marred by unstable and average film-making. In the first half it heavily relies on comedy that does not really bring out great laughs. In the second, it is far more interesting but never really manages to remain consistent. The dialogues, the drama are uninspiring, as is the film. The film is generally watchable despite the weak script and has several great things about it. Kajol and Ajay Devgan, a real-life couple, give two good performances, and their chemistry is obviously good as it has always been. Ajay, in a different role, is cool, mature and convincing. Aactually, as a director, he does a relatively impressive debut as well, and he rightly makes his talented wife the centre of attention here. Yeh, and it is our Kajol, who is natural and compelling. I liked the entire concept of Alzheimer and predicted a typical emotionally temperamental film. Happily, it didn't go over-the-top. But sadly, I somehow lost it and didn't see the point of the film. Maybe I should re-watch it.\n",

            "This film deserves an 8 cos of the solid direction, script n acting but I am generous with 10 so that more indie films like these r made in India n the reels of the awful ones like Simbba, Race 3, Padmavat, Kesari, etc, shud be flushed down the toilet.Also I am a sucker for Western films n it's rare to come across a Western film from Bollywood.Coming back to this film, it is n underrated directorial effort by Abhishek Chaubey whose earlier films were mostly shot in the dusty countrysides. It has shades of Outlaw Josey Wales n the film's twist is harrowing like the one from Incendies. It has awesome cinematography, stunning landscapes of rugged, ravine-streaked hills and calm rivers contrasted with bloody brutal gun fight sequences. The cinematography brings the bleakest of environments to frightening life, aided by the fact that the locations were every bit as bleak as they appeared on screen. The film is a juxtaposition of brutal reality and rustic serenity.The story is about outlaws living in the ravines. We have outlaws based on the caste system but the most neglected n persecuted ones r the poor dalits.My only two cribs. They shud have shown some crocodile violence n they shud have shown the lead cop's heading busting like a watermelon.\n",

            "For me, the most beautiful thing about 'Muqaddar Ka Sikandar' is the song 'O Saathi Re'. It is a wonderful song and is sung beautifully by Kishore Kumar. Amitabh Bachchan does a good job of expressing the emotions of the song.\"Muqaddar ka...\" is a tragedy (and a particularly tragic one), but it's a tragedy that manages to evoke just the right amount of sympathy, without becoming unduly weepy or maudlin. It's a tragedy done properly, with class, honesty and depth. Amitabh Bachchan is great as the lead character. I just loved him in this film, from start to finish (the little boy who played the young 'Sikandar' was wonderful too). Sikandar is at heart a good (even noble) man, but yet is a deeply flawed character, who feels deeply but is completely unable to express it. He's been hardened by his life, but he still has a very soft core, which few get to see. The scene at Memsahib's birthday celebration (when she's older), when Sikandar comes in with her precious gift, is breathtaking. It's a haunting echo of the experience Sikandar had at her 'younger' birthday party. A beautifully nuanced performance, definitely one of the Big B's best.Vinod Khanna also does a lovely job as the young lawyer, Vishal, in this movie, and the rest of the cast does well, too ... with one notable exception: the lead female, Rakhee. By the time the film was over, I hated her character, and I'm not sure that was the intention of the film makers(or was it?). She managed to portray 'Memsahib' as extremely shallow, uncaring and fickle. It's difficult to see even what the character of Vishal sees in her (although Sikandar's love for her - being completely childlike, pure and unselfish, is perfectly understandable). Even her last-minute repentance rung hollow. I've seen Rakhee do loads better in other movies, so I won't hold it against her in this one .. although it does slightly retract from the overall quality of the movie.Rekha, as Zohrabai, deserves a mention ... hauntingly lovely and tragic (which is what she does best), she puts in a very good performance. Her role is very stereotypical, but she pulls it off and makes it memorable. Watch out for the scene where she threatens to swallow the diamond.All in all, this movie is simply unmissable Bollywood. Watch it, and I guarantee you'll be hearing 'O Saathi Re' in your head for a few days afterwards.\n",

Yes it's another un-believable Bollywood story, but if you watch this movie you know what to expect. The characters are reasonably well developed, even their motivations are well developed. Sushmita / Shimmer is the center character, making all others meet and interact. Her character is a celebrity hungry top model, but she soon befriends a young woman who was deceived by her new husband, who happens to be Shimmer's best friend. Then the Bollywood effect occurs and situations go on as characters have to react to them and delve into their inner feelings. The whole thing is well acted, led by Sushmita with strength and class (and awesome beauty).\n",

            "Director Mr. Prakash Jha had done better acting than direction. There is nothing in the name of story rather than compilation of some deliberate incidents. Screenplay is jerky and very convenient. Film starts with land acquisition issue then shifts focus towards an incident which was not new but writers pops up that one, as something unusual abruptly. Use of I phone, digital password protected safe reflect that movie belongs to 2016 but not a single person or Police bother to think about use of mobile surveillance for location tracking of needed person rather they follow the routine check ups. In a scene, precisely a shot A.S.P , B.N. Singh is sleeping with his wife but then she is nowhere even when he was in hospital after he got brutal beating!? Then what was the need to show his wife in a shot? Election announcement angle was just to bind villains that they can't transfer the S.P but there was not any meaning full build up or campaign progress in rest of the film. A person kidnaps a girl to take her sign on paper, which he needs badly but then prefers to rape and murder her without taking the sign or holding her for few more days? He was so insane that he himself put his major chunk of wealth at risk by killing her? This movie has to be connected with prior one so they come out with murder of goons showing as suicide as it was acid attack in first part but first part it was by frustrated Police personal and with impressive build up but this time by public and forcefully. A small boy can lynch a heavy built person by pulling him with belt around his neck, it clearly looks that he would be unable to pull his dead body even but somehow he manages to kill him !!? Public is so angry and rebellious at that point and even they do same with another corrupt politician but they remain numb when heart changed A.S.P was being beaten brutally in front of them, even they prefer to not give statement as evidence and suddenly they turn out in huge number in climax!? Dialogues are OK but too cheesy, it was fine that constable level of Police personnel use to address their senior female office as madam sir but here A.S.P and rest of high rank officers do the same. Was all illiterate? Movie is set in M.P as it was shown written out side S.P office and auto rickshaw number with M.P then why they prefer to choose the name of two prominent places of Bihar, one Bankipur, one of major Police station of capital of Bihar , Patna and another district Lakhisaray? I was unable to understand the need, if you know geography of Bihar then you will get confused badly. Every time when any action is going on they plays irritating background songs which dull the impact badly. Emotional quotient and high octave scenes are missing. Performance wise Priyanka Chopda is very good. Praksh Jha as A.S.P , B.N. Singh is impressive but somehow his character was long and with unnecessary action like parallel lead. Manav Kaul as Babloo Pandey is first rate. His expressions are very subtle and balanced. Shakti Sinha as Prabhu Narayan ,Ninad Kamat as Dabloo Pandey and Murli Sharma as Munna Mardani , Rahul Bhatt as local leader Madhav, are OK.\n",

            "Raj Kapoor's social dramedy \"Shree 420\" is a real classic gem. His character represents the common man who is lost in a world dominated by the rich and famous. This role, in an amazingly dizzy combination of comedy and drama, is unforgettable. He is sad, he is lonely, he does not know what the future plans for him, so he just prefers to forget it all, be cynical and laugh about his misery. He falls in love with a beautiful young woman called Vidya and wants to succeed on his own moral terms, but it's just impossible when the society is cruel. After being introduced to the world of gamblers by a vulgar dancer named Maya where he can use his talent for card manipulation, he decides to use his skills and become part of this corrupted society. When he wants to come back, it's perhaps too late. Such was the lot for simple people of that time.Raj Kapoor makes a fantastic job in terms of acting and directing. As a director, he pays attention to details and makes sure all the required elements of the film are done realistically. As an actor, he delivers a terrific performance. His comic timing is top-notch, his pain is well evident, and he makes his character's transformation from a simple funny guy to a sophisticated gambler to a serious and unhappy businessman brilliantly. Nargis, as his beloved Vidya, is just splendid. She is presented as the epitome of goodness, Indian female beauty, purity and modesty. She was a superb actress by every possible standard of judgement, and in this film, too, she is incredibly graceful, natural and believable. Note the scene when Vidya visits the casino along with Raj and is later publicly humiliated by Nadira's Maya. She starts crying quietly and ashamedly, while Raj looks at her, unable to say a word. It's a wonderful scene, brilliantly acted and executed. It goes without saying that Kapoor and Nargis had the most powerful on-screen chemistry of their time.The movie includes a host of great character actors enacting their parts with conviction. The glorious Lalita Pawar stands out as Gangamai, a lovable woman who is a mother figure to the entire street and to Raj in particular. Pawar exudes a warmth that makes it easy to understand why she is so loved by the people in the movie, and her interaction with Raj is very well portrayed. This is one of the famous roles of Nadira, and she really does a good job as Maya, the total opposite of Vidya (also in their symbolic names). Her vicious expressions, sharp line delivery and the way she stylishly smoke her cigarettes in a holder, created the ultimate vamp of the times, reminiscent of the many characters played by Bette Davis. Nemo is also very well cast as Sonachand Dharmanand. Hari Shivdasani is excellent as Vidya's father.I liked the realistic portrayal of life in urban Bombay of the 50s. Kapoor conveys the irony of the big city very well. Street beggars appear to have more knowledge in life than the so-called elite people; people sell more than they buy in order to survive the next couple of days, even if it means they have to cede their most precious assets; street dwellers feel they own these very streets just because that's where they sleep, and everyone is in search of money, because money runs the world. That's where Raj is thrown. He needs money but he can't find a job despite having an academic degree. This forces him to steal and lie, compromising his core values. But if you do it, you are a swindler and get branded \"420\" by the so-called reputable citizens, most of whom are mere phonies and are the real thieves of society, who try to turn the poor people into scapegoats so that they can hide their own crimes. A paradox that is both funny and sad, because it's real.The film's soundtrack, composed by Shankar-Jaikishan, is considered to be an all-time classic, and rightfully so. Apart from the movie's signature song \"Mere Joota Hai Japani\", my favourite numbers are \"Pyar Hua Ikrar Hua\" and \"Ramaiya Vastavaiya\" which are not only melodious and memorable but also very beautifully pictured in the film, efficiently representing the contradictory moods and states of mind of the lead pair. The former shows their dreams and hopes of forming a happy family life together, and the latter presents their sadness and loneliness on parted ways, while in the backdrop the street people are singing and dancing, still holding hope for a better day. I cannot forget the heartbreaking moment showing Nargis's Vidya sitting serenely and teary-eyed on her home's pavement, softly singing the poignant lines of the song. At the same time it shows Kapoor's pain of losing his own self upon seeing his old friends, yearning to come back to his previous, poor but happy life.That was Kapoor's way of perceiving the art of cinema and life in general, I believe. Through this movie and his character he shows us that laughing at yourself, making fun of common social diseases, switching masks from sad to happy and vice versa in order to see this crazy world from a clearer perspective, is the best way to go. That's one of the aspects that make this film so thoroughly fascinating and entertaining, and apart from its socially relevant message, it has a wide range of emotions and memorable moments which make it the classic that it is. The ending is fantastic, ultimately showing us that it actually is possible to live a decent life and not lose yourself, and more than anything, change the world. \"Shree 420\" has it all, superb comedy, powerful drama, charming romance, great music. It is full of hope, love and optimism, and can be easily described as not only one of Raj Kapoor's best, but also one of Indian cinema's finest.\n",

            "After you have seen Chandni Bar, your perception of any prostitutes around the world will change drastically. Instead of looking at a prostitute as a sexually satisfying object, you will look deeper into her and realize \"why she ever became a prostitute in the first place\". It is too easy to say that \"there is no excuse for being a prostitute, and one can choose his/her own career in life\", but after you have seen Chandni Bar, your view point will change completely and you will want to help many women who are helpless/poor/prostitutes around the globe.Chandni Bar starts by introducing the main character's traumatic beginnings that locks her into doing things she willingly doesn't want to. Throughout the film, the \"change room door\" in the bar signifies the actual life of helplessly trapped women on one side of the door, and the \"pretentious women\" on the other side of the door who make a living by selling themselves.In conclusion the film has been very well put together, and has an excellent direction (worthy of film awards).I have had tears rolling down my cheeks over ten times when I watched this film, and I suggest you view it with someone who has very little respect for women or views them as sex object. This is a very hard hitting film that will touch you deep within.My Score: 10 / 10 (for all the ten tears I had)Watch, listen and understand !NEIL BHATIA\n",

            "In 1999, under the scheme of General Parvez Musharraf, our perennial enemy backstabbed us and Pakistani soldiers crossed the LOC in the disguise of civilian infiltrators. Some of the regular patrol parties of Indian soldiers went missing and later on, the damaged corpses of our young soldiers were found. And then the eyes of the sleeping Indian politicians and the intelligence bureau got opened to the fact that there has been large scale illegal infiltration on our soil from the other side of the LOC. A formally undeclared war started which lasted for around 50 days and we lost several precious lives of Indian soldiers. The war had to be won in the end and we won it but the price that was paid was just too much.The memory of the Indian masses is short and we very easily forget the sacrifices of the sacrificing ones and get back to our routines of earning a living. Hence, filmmaker J.P. Dutta tagged the line to the title of this movie - 'BEFORE WE FORGET'. Yes, he did an exemplary thing by making this movie before the invaluable sacrifices of the young bravehearts were forgotten by the Indian public. Mr. Dutta used real locations and even real ammunition to shoot this movie. And thereby he has brought the passionate and emotional tales of the real Indian soldiers alive on the screen. All the small and big tales with less footage to some and more footage to some other, are real and sensitive to the hilt. Mr. Dutta has presented everything with utmost authenticity on the screen which shows his deep research work in this regard. He had brought that period of May-July 1999 alive on the screen. A great effort indeed which entitles him for a big hand by the audience. Besides, he has been able to extract exemplary performances from the complete cast. Whether the role is a smaller one or a bigger one, everybody has given his best. Females did not have much to do. The best female performer is undoubtedly, Maaya Alagh. This veteran actress has delivered a highly touching performance as the mother of Lieutenant Manoj Pandey (Ajay Devgan).Anu Malik's music with Jaaved Akhtar's lyrics could not top up the charts but if you just listen to the songs peacefully and patiently, you will feel the quality of both the words and the tunes. The songs are quite long because the director had to accommodate the scenes of several actors while the song was continuing, but they are highly patriotic as well as touching. My favourite is Seemayen Bulaayen Tujhe Chal Raahi. But the other songs - Main Kahin Bhi Rahoon Har Kadam Har Ghadi, Pyar Bhara Geet Koi Dekho Piya Tumko Gaana Hi Hoga, Aao Jo Laut Ke Tum Ghar Ho Khushi Se Bhara etc. are also impressive and perfectly in line of the mood and the genre of the movie.In my view, Mr. Dutta himself committed two major mistakes which he should have avoided. Firstly, he has shown the soldiers mouthing highly obscene abuses. He had not done so in Border (1997) and it was correct. In this movie, on one hand, the soldiers are getting enthusiasm through religious slogans like Raja Raamchandra Ki Jai, Durga Maata Ki Jai and Jai Mahakaali whereas on the other, they are mouthing so bad words that the females (and also the decorous males) may find it difficult to keep their ears open. Swearings of mother and sister have been given so freely that the decency level has come down to very low. Though such words have been partially beeped, yet it can be understood with ease in each such case what is the complete word. This minus point has snatched the characteristic of a family movie from it. In the ending scenes, Colonel Y.K. Joshi (Sanjay Dutt) asks his subordinates to respect the dead bodies of the Pak soldiers. Then was it necessary to show disrespect to the mothers and sisters of the soldiers of either side ? Patriotism is not enriched by expletives Mr. Dutta.Secondly, he has tried to include as many incidents from the Kargil war as possible in the movie (still he could not include all such battles covered in that war) forgetting that the movie has to be completed within a reasonable time-duration. The fact that he overlooked is that unlike Border which was based on a particular battle in the 1971 war, the canvas of the story of this movie was many times more extensive and hence the temptation to cover everything had to be kept under check. Besides, we all know that the soldiers away from their homes miss their families and their beloved and vice-versa. This is an aspect which fills the gaps in a war-based movie with sentiments and tender feelings. However when there are so many characters (of soldiers), all of them cannot be accommodated in common songs. Mr. Dutta's attempt to do so have not only made the songs extremely long but also monotonous. All things said and done, irrespective of its commercial outcome, J.P. Dutta has made an honest and highly impressive movie. It's able to arouse love for your country in your heart. The complete unit of the movie including all those appearing on the screen and all those who worked behind the screen deserves a standing ovation from the audience.\n",

Supported by a thick North Indian accent that is used by almost all characters, it goes on to explore the hardships faced by young men and women who are in love yet fail to live together due to familial and societal pressures.

            "This movie is one of the most chameleon-like I have ever experienced. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it; but the mainly relaxed, whimsical, romantic opening (after the first encounter with the crime boss, who almost then seems to get forgotten for about 40 minutes, though you know he must resurface sometime) is filled with extravagant Bollywood dancing (though often with a more sexy feel than I have usually encountered in my so-far limited Bollywood experience) and over-played but highly amusing protestations of love on the part of the main character, Jai. In this portion, the aficianado of Bollywood ladies has plenty of opportunity to admire the very sexy Kim Sharma as Jai's childhood friend Sonia, and also of course his new love Neha played by Kareena Kapoor, who is more restrained in her sexiness but just demurely lovely. But after about 30-40 minutes, the pace and tone completely changes with one dramatic moment, and after that we are very much engaged in a helter-skelter action movie with multitude plot twists, wide-ranging shifts of location from India to Dubai to South Africa and even (I think) a small vignette in London, and a fair share of unarmed combat and exploding gunshot wounds.

            "Two genres in which Hindi Film Industry has not got many in its kitty are Spine Chilling Thrillers and Murder Mysteries. There are very few such brave and worth mentioning efforts which come to your mind instantly. Luckily we have seen some good thrillers in the recent times by the young brigade of innovative directors and \"The Stoneman Murders\" is yet another path breaking and engrossing attempt by the director, Manish Gupta.The movie is a mix of real life take on the serial killings of 1983 with a touch of fiction added by the writers giving it a more sensational feel. It talks about the horrifying terror on the streets, spread by a brutal killer who used to kill the poor people sleeping on the roadside by crushing their head with a stone, therefore named as Stoneman Murderer. And both the director and the writers come up with a brilliant portrayal of this real life case on the silver screen.The main merit of the movie is that it straight away starts off with the main topic and sticks to its till the end. There are no deliberately added sub plots, songs or any comic scenes which make it more harsh, bold and impressive. The whole narration revolves around Kay Kay Menon, who is a suspended Police Inspector paying the price for his anger practiced in an interrogation. After his suspension, he is still investigating the Stoneman Case, privately on the instructions of his senior, Vikram Gokhale and also gets assistance by a Hawaldaar played by Virendra Saxena. His colleague inspector, Arbaaz Khan, who is more of an opponent, is also working on the same case creating troubles for KK.What makes the movie, a path-breaking attempt is the dark & shocking secret behind all the murders committed by the Stoneman. It also shows the ugly side of our rotten system we are all living in. As the search progresses, KK manages to solve the case, but his superiors don't let the secret come out in the open for some good reasons of their own. So the case which was duly solved by him, still remains as an unsolved murder mystery in the police records due to its disgraceful truth. I will not like to disclose the mystery here for my friends as that is main highlight of the movie, but i would surely like to add that the twist has a great shock element in store for the viewers.One more interesting observation is that despite the fact that the movie is based on some brutal and cruel murders committed by a psychopath; still it does not have any bloody or weird visuals. The director very impressively gives you a clean and sober picture without moving into some trance or blood-shed. Instead he chooses to show the real news paper pictures to show the murders committed by the killer on the roadsides. Among the well shot sequences, capable of making you jump on the edge of your seat is the sub-way sequence, when KK has a scuffle with the killer but he manages to escape, injuring KK badly. The interval sequence also leaves you awestruck, with your jaws open, asking for more.Performance wise, KK as expected delivers another gem of his career. The complete movie moves more around him and he manages to carry it all with elegance and conviction. Vikram Gokhale is impressive once again and perfectly suits the role. Arbaaz has got few scenes and he does a fine job. Rukhsaar as KK's wife though doesn't get a well defined role, but still gives a sober and sweet performance. Virendra Saxena as KK's associate Hawaldaar is one of the most under-rated character artists we have. I still remember his haunting presentation of a Sikh Freedom Fighter in the Tele-Serial \"Tamas\" and since then have seen him giving many memorable performances in several movies consistently.In a murder mystery or a thriller, background music has a very important role to play and this department is handled well by the music director giving ample support to the subject and feel. The movie is majorly shot at nights and still you are not taken into dark visuals and dim lightning. So the Cinematography is perfect keeping the scenes bright with proper lighting and effects.In all, if you are fan of thrillers and murder mysteries, then this is a treat to watch after the recent \"A Wednesday\". It was indeed a pity that I watched the movie in an almost empty theater. Attempts like these need to be applauded and encouraged by the viewers. But sadly, the Indian movie lovers still go to the theater looking at the faces on the poster and not due to the subject or theme of the movie. I would also like to thank and congratulate Mr. Bobby Bedi (Kaleidoscope), for backing up such projects in these tough recession times.So, here is another surprising small movie, simply not to be missed.\n",

            "Bhatts have been copycats since they started, except for Arth, Saraansh, Daddy and a few films like Naam, most of Bhatt films have been copies. All 3 Murder Installments have been copies, Murder(2004) was a copy of Unfaithful, Murder 2(Korean film CHASER) both did superbly well at the B.O and the first one made a star out of Emraan Hashmi, The Third Installment stars their regular since Jannat 2 Randeep Hooda. This time however there have made a legitimate remake of A Spanish thriller The Hidden Face(2011). The original was a well made thriller which is too bold for Bollywood, so to fit in the Bhatt formula, we have songs, the profession of the lead hero is changed from a orchestra conductor to a Photographer so that the Bhatts can have skimply clad models showing up. That apart nudity compared to the original is on low here. The film focuses more on emotional content rather then sex but sadly the film is a complete copy paste job from the original, even the lines have the same punch, the few things have been changed which don't fit in. The first half builds in slowly like the original, unlike the original we have Aditi's character shown in the first half itself through a flashback. The first half focuses on Randeep and Sara while the second half solves the mystery. The film may seem alien for Bollywood as there is hardly action and the film flows in a relaxed manner. The film however lacks the punch like in most Bollywood remakes of the original, like for instance there are some loopholes, There is a scene showing Randeep with a kerosene can in his car and later the car is blown up and a body is found, but the scene isn't explained till the end The dialogues and the forced songs too do a lot of harm especially the lines which are changed. The climax is similar to the original, albeit a bit modified and leaves scope for a sequel like the original.Direction by Vishesh Bhatt is ordinary, most of the film is copied but he does handle some scenes well Music is typical Bhatt style, some songs are hummableRandeep Hooda with a new hairstyle gives a decent performance, though the role doesn't demand much from him. Aditi Rao Hyderi is superb in her part, more so in the second half while Sara Loren(perhaps a dubbed voice) seen after the dud Kajra Re(2010) is okay. Rajesh Shringarpure as police officer,Shekhar Shukla and Bugs Bhargava make no much impact.\n",

            "The movie was definitely not what was expected. It starts with 3 wannabes (Two Delhi daredevils and a Mumbai cha mulga) trying to loot a bank, and then failing miserably while doing that. But that's just the start. What follows is a series of twists and turns which continue till the very climax which is something that you don't wanna miss. So sit back and forget logic and sense of humour for the first half of the movie and wait till the end to enjoy this comic thriller (less of a comic and a lot more of a serious though). Overall rating : 7/10 Suitable for family viewing : Yes definitely\n",

            "In my list of top Hindi films of the 1990s, 'Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai' would definitely rank among the best. It is a brilliant, moving and charming romantic drama with a fantastic story and beautiful songs. Salman Khan stars as Suraj, a young and carefree man who's popular with women and who's good for nothing but chasing women, partying and drinking. But one day he meets Komal and truly falls for her. After a few ups and downs the two finally get together. However, just when things go right and everything including marriage is planned, a little kid named Kabir appears on Suraj's doorstep and claims to be his son. This brings Suraj's past mistakes back and now he has to deal with that. From then on the story follows his relationship with both Komal and particularly Kabir, and shows how he gets close to his own child, who is the result of his past affair with Pooja, a woman who is no more.The film is interesting and entertaining, and is very well written. Honey Irani's script does not disappoint, neither do Javed Siddiqui's dialogues. The film is not without its clichés, but it is not overly melodramatic like most of the films made at that time. It has many moving moments, particularly those portraying the relationship of Suraj and Kabir. Deepak Sareen, who was Yash Chopra's assistant, directs this feature and this is probably his best work. One must also note the superb soundtrack composed by Jatin-Lalit. Every song is a pleasure to listen to. Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and the divine Lata Mangeshkar sing most of the film's songs, and they perform brilliantly. \"Is Dil Mein Kya Hai\" is catchy and modern, \"Madhosh Dil Ki\" is quiet and nice, but the song which is most identified with the film is the wonderful \"O Janna Na Jaana\" which is beautifully shot across some breathtaking locations.Those were the days when Salman Khan fully dedicated himself to his films and roles and did the best of what he was given. 'Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai' ranks amongst the finest performances of his career. He is totally believable as the womanising and irresponsible grandson, as the loving boyfriend, and finally as the man who just learns that he is actually a father and now has to deal with this situation and take responsibility. Khan plays his part with sincerity and depth and makes his character very easy to relate to. This film also marks the best work of Twinkle Khanna's short career. Aditya Narayan is fantastic as Kabir, Suraj's illegitimate and intelligent son. Anupam Kher lends adequate support, and the beautiful Namrata Shirodkar gives a fine debut performance as Pooja. To sum it up, 'Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai' is a memorable and underrated picture, and so is Salman Khan's convincing portrayal.\n",

            "I'd been wanting to watch 'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag' for a while mainly because it starred one of my favorite actresses Konkona Sen Sharma and a used-to-be favorite Rani Mukerjee (I still like her). In spite of hearing the bad reviews, I was still considering it as I expected that in the least I'd get to see two great performances. That's all I got.Pradeep Sarkar could have made one fine movie but with so many unnecessary (and irritating) characters, the bad writing (clichès etc) and lack of character development the film is hugely bought down. Why the hell was there a need to have the whole Tinnu Anand - Sushant Singh track (they're irritating)? A wooden Abhishek adds nothing interesting (another track that could have better been left out). Anupam Kher hams it up as a card-board selfish (misogynist?) dad. Likewise the other characters are badly written. In the beginning we see a frantic Jaya Bachchan in the hospital when the husband's had a heart attack but Konkona's Chutki is shown to be very relaxed (as if nothing happened). Was she simply in denial or was she just staying positive? Then in a later scene (before Rani becomes an escort call girl) we see that her neighbor-friend offers her money for help but she still decides to sleep with his boss. Was it simply that phone call to her mother that pushed her off the edge? Jaya Bachchan plays a caricature mother and this can be added to one of her worst performances. In addition to all the mess, most of the songs were horrible and should have been edited out. The only songs that stand out are the first track, the song that takes place when Badki becomes Natassha and the Mujra (even though it was chopped and could have been better left as a whole). The outdoor locations (e.g. Switzerland and Italy) in the songs were unnecessary but what would a Yashraj film be without such flooze?On the positive side, as mentioned earlier, there are two standout performances. Apart from that one scene mentioned above, Konkona is brilliant. The role itself is not something particularly special, but the actress is and she definitely leaves a mark. The scenes with her and Rani are the best. Thankfully, there are enough of those to make the film somewhat worth the watch. It was funny seeing her do the singing and dancing (as it's the first time she's done that) not that she was bad or anything.'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag' is Rani's film. The actress does one of her best acts and shows tremendous growth. Easily one of the best performances this year and all Rani needs is more great (and such different) roles in great films to mark her talent.Hema Malini does a graceful cameo. However her dance-number is chopped into pieces. 'Would have liked to see her dance more. The cinematography is impressive, especially the shots of Banaras. On the whole, this is one severely flawed and very predictable film but with two fantastic performances that prevent me from calling it a waste of time. I'd recommend it to those who like the works of Rani and Konkona as long as they don't expect anything from the film itself.\n",

            "I think I know what happened here. The Baweja's spent so much money on the Australian locales and special effects / animation on the 2050 part that they ran out of money and employed themselves as the story / screenplay writers and also forgot to employ an editor. The result is a movie reeking with inane, hammy dialogue, a story crammed with unnecessary sub-plots and silly twists and turns. And I honestly think they put every scene they shot, up on the screen. They forgot the editor or his scissors He-man type, extreme sport loving Harman falls for a mills & boon type, pink colour loving, Priyanka who writes a diary, scribbles hearts, and names toys 'Winkydinks' and 'Boo'. Harman woo's her by break dancing and doing all the silly things that work only in movies and never in real life. He also immediately transforms from an alpha male character into a mushy, soppy mass of goo, who breaks into tears at the drop of a handkerchief. Enter an uncle, mad scientist type, who has a time machine, some more very silly twists and turns, and we're off for Mumbai 2050. There are three glaring examples of sub-plots which didn't need to be there at all  The two kids : firstly I know of no kids like them, they're irritating, try to be cute, are all senti-mushy-yucky and mouth sentences no self-respecting kids would. Secondly, there's not one reason why they had to exist on-screen.  Harman Baweja's Dad  again, the whole father-son relationship thing was unnecessary. The story wouldn't have changed one iota, if Harman had simply remarked 'i'm on my own'and we would've saved fifteen minutes of screen time  The whole Hoshi angle : an unnecessary caricature of a villain they introduced in the 2050 part of the film. Come to think of it, they could've just shown Harman and Priyanka to be dating already, spared us the whole courtship thing and gone ahead directly with the 2050 part. So whats good about the film ? The locales in Australia are very nice, well-chosen and for a change its not about Sydney, the opera house and Sydney harbour but something more interesting. Priyanka is all pouty, looks decent, even in red hair. And the futuristic animation / special effects are good. Not great, but good and with a couple of nice touches (the Kantabai hologram and the paan-making robot were interesting thoughts). Harman can dance, look good but is overly made-up (the lip gloss is too prominent) and is very bad at dialogue delivery. His character, during courtship, is also shown doing a couple of things which are very silly (getting up while a roller-coaster is moving and stealing a toy) and kids may take up on that. And eets long, this movie, very painful and very long. I went more for the 2050 part but unfortunately it's the Love Story part that dominates  they don't let go even in the 2050 part and spoil that too. When I first heard the toy name 'winkydinks', my instinct was to get up and run. I didn't obey it and sat through. Big mistake. Big. Huge ! For more reviews, please go to apurvbollywood at blogspot.

            "This is simply David Dhawans Best Movie he directed. If you are a Bollywood fan and know your Bollywood cinema, then the jokes in this film will appeal to you. Out of all the funny movies I've seen. These include Andaz Apna Apna, Coolie No. 1, Dulhe Raja, No Entry, Garam Masala, Hera Pheri and many more. Deewana Mastana belongs to the Anil Kapoor and Johnny Lever Teamwork. They both gave a comically brilliant performance. Juhi Chawla looks cute and was fabulous. Govinda, a natural comedian was Hilllarious. The ending was the funniest endings I've seen. After getting fed up of watching Bollywood Movies with the same storyline over and over again, about 2 guys like the same girl, and one sacrifices. you finally get a love triangle, where to men meet, instead of becoming friends, they instantly become the worst of enemies, fighting to impress the actress. So much intelligent jokes. Ive seen this 30 times and it never gets boring. So wrongly underrated, It was a big success But it didnt get the respect it deserves. It should be regarded as one of the Best comedies in Bollywood.\n",

Arbaaz was ok, but I don't think any other actor would suit his role more. Songs were great, especially \"Acchhi lagti ho.\" The kid brings an interesting twist to the story. Ok, so I admit it, not every part of the movie was strikingly different and authentic, such as the scene where Abhishek goes down some amusement park water slide that is supposed to look like a dangerous hill in the middle of a thunderstorm, but the movie had strong emotions. With Aishwarya's great acting, it was easy to sympathize with the characters.\n",

            "I'm still getting up to speed on Bollywood films. I didn't start watching them until recently, so I don't have extensive background knowledge that would enable me to connect the dots as I can with other films when it comes to Bollywood-oriented references, influences and the like, although it's frequent enough that Bollywood films reference American and other films for which I can connect the dots. But for all of the Bollywood films I've watched so far, I keep encountering reviews wherein the film is criticized for being clichéd, recycling plots, and so on. Andaaz is no exception. However, with the films I've watched so far, I haven't noticed anything yet that I'd call a recycled or rip-off plot. I'm starting to wonder if people are not looking at the films from a very \"distant\", generalized perspective, where they're seeing similarities because most Bollywood films involve romances that aren't exactly smooth sailing, conflicts with cultural traditions, and so on. That's not a factor of clichés or recycling plots, it's related to cultural facts and desires, and at \"worst\", it's a factor of defining the \"Bollywood\" genre.But even assuming Andaaz was recycling the plot of some famous precursor, so that it would be something like an uncredited remake, I don't agree that we should subtract points for that. What matters is how well the film does what it does. On those terms, Andaaz is excellent. It came extremely close to getting a 10 from me--only a few bits of stylistic awkwardness, mostly related to editing, lowered my score to a 9, but I'm tempted to overlook those flaws and go ahead with the 10.The story is centered on Raj (Akshay Kumar) and Kajal (Lara Dutta), who begin their relationship as childhood friends, when Kajal encouraged Raj to overcome a handicap--he had an accident and was wearing a leg brace. In a scene right out of Forrest Gump (1994), Kajal pushes Raj to skate like a pro, so that his brace pops right off and he's \"cured\". We jump ahead to Raj as a young adult when he's a local star footballer. He and Kajal are still close--but he's in love with her and she doesn't notice; she thinks they're just great friends. Raj goes off to the air force--primarily because Kajal has loved airplanes ever since she was a kid, and Raj wants to learn to fly for her. When he returns home, things have not gone quite as planned. Raj loses Kajal and becomes alienated and a bit bitter. Even when another beautiful woman, Jiya (Priyanka Chopra), tries to court him, he is not interested. There are a couple twists during the last hour or so, and the film ends up emphasizing important \"messages\" through its climax.Kumar is a very fine actor. The script requires him to go through a wide range of difficult emotional transformations, which he does with ease. The two female leads are also good, even if their performances are less wide-ranging, but both also have to undergo at least one important emotional/attitudinal transformation by the end of the film. There is also a number of entertaining support performances, including an amusing turn by Indian comedian Johnny Lever as \"G.I. Joe\".Of course as a mainstream Bollywood film, Andaaz is also a musical. The songs here are some of my favorites from a modern Bollywood film so far, although that may be partially because they've had more time to \"stew\"--I've owned the soundtrack on CD since it first came out in 2003. More than most other Bollywood films I've seen, director Raj Kanwar shoots the musical numbers in a strong western music video mode. This works most of the time, although one of the slight flaws in my opinion was an early musical number, \"Shalala Shalala\", with more of a disco feel and a 1980s look. But some of the later songs and accompanying visual sequences are breathtaking--especially the landscape stuff shot in South Africa, such as for \"Rabba Ishq Na Hove\". But Kanwar gives us pleasant cinematography throughout the film.Also interesting and unusual are some of the air force scenes, which at times resemble a cross between Top Gun (1986) and U.S. Armed Forces television commercials (which usually had admirable technical qualities). Even with such disparate elements, Kanwar keeps the story tight and focused, which isn't easy to do while meeting the typical range of Bollywood moods and stretching them out to about 2 and a half hours. There are a couple weird or corny editing effects and transitions, but these are relatively minor gaffes.The core of the film, though, is the heart-wrenching romantic material and the important themes/subtexts. Kanwar, who also wrote the story upon which the script was based, stresses that one must express one's feelings when one has them. A couple major plot points hinge on Raj avoiding communicating his feelings, but he's not the only person who has that problem in the film. There is also a very important theme and subtext about challenging cultural traditions, but Kanwar is careful to stress that such challenges shouldn't be done arbitrarily or across the board, just for their own sake. Jiya has problems with Raj because she's challenging traditions in a way that may be undesirable, but the climax hinges on the necessity of challenging traditions when it comes to \"true love\". Also during the climax, the emotional/attitudinal transformations that have been occurring throughout the film with all three principal characters (as well as some minor ones) reach their apex--everyone finally matures, emotionally and ethically.\n",

            "When I find myself reaching for the fast forward button right at the beginning of a film I know it won't be the last time. I LOVE Hrithik Roshan so I can even forgive him for this film for reasons explained later in this humble review.The story is of a young college student (Hrithik) who sees a young girl(Amesha) in a car and falls in love with her . Hrithik's character goes out of his way to meet her & when they eventually meet at her house, his love is reciprocated but the girl is kept under house arrest by her father who has violent criminal connections. Hrithik's character again goes out of his way help her & manages to spirit her away from the house for some time alone. There are some very long dance sequences and ultimately there may be a happy ending but with much violence and upset along the way. And much exposure of Hrithik's muscles (particularly toward the end).This review is just my opinion and I always say it is best to make up your own mind if you're going to watch a film, so of course people will read it and disagree, that's only right. However I feel so sorry for Hrithik in this one. I don't know who choreographed his first dance sequence, immediately after the films costume designer kitted him out in some very dainty shorts for him to skip up the football pitch - but they should have been shot with the rest of the criminals in the first gun-fight.I can only think after the success of K.K.K.G that someone wanted to make a fast rupee or two out of Hrithik & the choice to do the film was out of his hands. In my opinion he was given poor dialogue, poor choreography & poor action to deliver and unfortunately for my number one Bollywood star the end result was poor too.\n",

            "Honeymoon Travels Private Ltd: Movie Review Rating: *** Honeymoon Travels Private Ltd, as one expects, is a story of six diverse couples on their honeymoon tour to Goa. But what one doesn't predict is the experience in store for them.There is a Bengali couple with a conservative husband (Kay Kay Menon) and a raring-to-go wife (Raima Sen). There is a perfect Parsi couple (Abhay Deol  Minissha Lamba) who are always in sync with each other and never ever catch up a fight. A Gujarati duo flawlessly named Hitesh (Ranvir) and Shilpa (Dia Mirza) forms the imperfect couple. Then there is an NRI Richie (Vikram Chatwal) married to a Bambaiyya girl (Sandhya Mridul). A college lovebird duo (Amisha Patel  Karan Khanna) and an elderly couple (Boman Irani  Shabana Azmi) complete the dozen honeymooners. So what's the story? Well their characterizations itself! The character driven film takes the story forward with each couple's flashback narrative and a fast-forward tale telling in a span of the six days of their honeymoon in Goa.With its six assorted anecdotes, this light-hearted romantic comedy tries to capture the varied flavours of love. You might love some story, laugh on some, relate to some and perhaps even reject some. But there's enough on the platter to keep you satiated. How and what you digest depends on your love appetite.Debutante director Reema Kagti (who has assisted on films like Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai) adopts a fascinating storytelling technique. Despite six separate stories the film isn't episodic which gives more scope of chemistry between the characters that forms the major highlight of the screenplay. The flashback fable of each couple unravels in an interesting black-n-white frame with a retro song to support each. The use of a radio show to narrate the flashback episodes is a unique idea but might not connect with those accustomed to conventional narrative techniques. Each flashback installment is kept crisply short.The screenplay is intelligently innovative though at instances it even resorts to some cinematic clichés. The best example of the former being Raima Sen's para sailing sequence in a sari and for the latter it's when Raima Sen displays her martial arts antics  nevertheless both the scenes keeps you in splits. The treatment is rather subtle and at times is left for the audience to apprehend  like the culmination of Karan Khanna's character.There are a couple of surprises in the climax. (And this doesn't include the identity of the biker who follows the bus from the start. That's revealed in the initial reels itself). In fact the bigger of two surprises will make your jaw drop out of disbelief. But if you don't mind cinematic liberties for fun-factor in films, it might just stretch a smile on your face out of the hilarity. However it makes you wonder why in the end, the director did not bank upon the build up made for this surprise throughout the film through the clues thrown out (this might sound gibberish while you read but you will understand this only when you watch the film). If you aren't a keen observer, the clues thrown in by the director to invoke suspense in the film, might become apparent to you only on a second viewing.While most of the characters have put in a decent performance, Kay Kay Menon steals the show. His characterization is the strongest or perhaps he has made it so believable with his sincere act. You instantly connect with his character of a modern day man but with a conservative traditional backdrop. The actor often relegated to serious roles in films like Sarkar and Black Friday, surprises with his flair for comedy. And his now-popular dance movements in the song 'Sajnaji Vari Vari' is one of the major highlights of the film. His fight sequence with Ranvir Shorey in the bus is absolutely hilarious. How one wishes the film had more of the brilliant Ranvir. Boman Irani never goes wrong with his character, then be it any role in the world. So even as Oscar Fernandes, he perfects the accent for a Goan Christian. Raima Sen gets a meaty role and impresses both with her looks (despite being sari-clad throughout the film) and performance. Karan Khanna doesn't have much to speak but emotes well. Dia Mirza looks damn cute when she cries in the opening scene of the film. Minissha has a charming aura and indulges in an impeccable salsa with Abhay Deol. And when it comes to Shabana Azmi, the flawless actress doesn't need an approval for her act. Amisha Patel is supposed to play an irritating bimbo character and she succeeds in irritating you to the core. But don't misconstrue it for she doing justice to her character. She actually irritates and comes as the only actor miscast in the film with her constant hamming.Overall Honeymoon Travels is an entertaining journey. Do take the bus. Recommended!\n",

            "This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is the laughter never stops. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour stays. Memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.All in all I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. It will easily give it a 10/10.\n",

            "I give this movie a straight ten on ten because it makes you laugh non stop. Andaz Apna apna, Deewana Mastana are some of the funniest films ever in Bollywood. Dulhe Raja can be added as one of the funniest films of Hindi cinema. Govinda is one of the funniest actors in Bollywood at the time and this is an example of why. Raveena Tandon looks pretty and she is a good co star with Govinda. There is one fabulous song and that is Akhiyon se goli maare. Johnny Lever is a comedy support in this movie and this mans comic timing is fantastic. Kader Khan is a genius of an comedy actor, he is one of Bollywoods greatest supporting actors. The storyline is not perfect, but it delivers laughs which is good enough.\n",

            "Raj Kumar Santoshi as director is at his element while handling a script that demands its pound of action and strong dialogues. With Halla Bol he gets those occasional moments and on their basis the movie is worth a watch. Movie star Ajay Devgan (Sameer Khan) knows the ropes of how the industry works and does his bit as a member of the film fraternity who bitches behind the back of colleagues, acts in umpteen commercials or turns sycophant, dramatic, romantic as the situation in reel or real life may demand. But when he becomes an eye witness to murder at a party (Jessica Lal episode revisited) his conscience is at a crossword.With the aid of his theatre guru Pankaj Kapur (Sidhu) he declares Halla Bol on the nexus of politicians and important businessman who believe they can protect their guilty sons since they control the reins of 'Power' 'Paisa' and 'Public' in the country.The plot dips and loses audience interest at times since its a script that has been done in different variants before but then you can trust the director to deliver a few moments that draw a clap from the audience.The dialogues between Ajay Devgan and the Politician along with those few minutes when Pankaj Kapur reacts to a bribe are strong points and raise the movie above the ordinary.Ajay Devgan puts in a spirited performance but the movie belongs to Pankaj Kapur who lights up the screen every time (reminiscent of Sunny Deol doing his bit with Damini).For his portrayal as Sidhu - a reformed dacoit - and a bit of Ajay Devgan each time he hits out at the political big wig makes Halla Bol a movie to watch and get, shall we say a bit inspired.\n",

            "Singh Saab The Great is a Sunny Deol show all the way!!! But this is no regular masala fare, this film has a high concept, a good message, and family sentiment. While the first half goes by layering the plot , showing some family sentiment, the second half is where the film really roars with, some great action, amazing dialouges and in the climax Sunny Deol takes the film to new heights!!!The films story is very simple,change is needed not revenge. The film tells the tale of an honest collector Saranjit Talwar he gets transferred to new areas all the times because of his honesty.He hates corruption bribes etc. Enter Bhudev Singh a goon politician he runs the sand mafia in the new place Talwar is transfered. They clash, Bhudev poisons Talwars wife's drink at his sisters wedding, she dies and Talwar is sent to jail because Bhudev sends him to jail in a fake corruption charge.In jail he meets his jailer friend who teaches him to forget his revenge India needs his help, its needs change for its betterment. The Jailer then helps Talwar get out of jail he then becomes Singh Saab and he wants to end all corruption in India. Does Singh Saab make a change, does he seek revenge on Bhudev, is what forms the main plot.Acting wise its a Sunny Deol show all the way, he shines as Singh Saab, he delivers powerful dialouges, and fights like never before. The original action hero is in amazing form!!! Other notable acts are of Prakash Raj who is menacing as the villain, Johnny Lever who provides laughter, and Yashpal Sharma who makes a good henchman. Dir Anil Sharma makes a high concept film, his film has a big heart, but the wife and sister scenes in the film don't work. At times there is too much melodrama. The songs also other than the title song are so so and don't make a impact.But Sharma gets saved by Sunny Deol and his amazing dialouges. If only his first half of the film had less melodrama it would be as powerful as the second half. The pace is also slow in the first half, and film could be trimmed by 15-20 min to make more of a impact.Overall the film works because of Sunny Deol, and the great second half, and the pluses out due the minuses. The films also has a lot of Punjabi flavor so if your Punjabi or a fan of Sunny Deol Singh Saab the Great is a must watch. 3.5/5*\n",

            "From the last few years Bollywood has been open to fresh ideas and low budget experimental projects especially after the success of small films such as BHEJA FRY (2007). But where Bheja Fry was a complete rip-off, the present BUMBOO is the official remake of L'EMMERDEUR or A PAIN IN THE ASS (1973) written by Francis Veber who interestingly was also the man behind THE DINNER GAME (1998), the original source for Bheja Fry. It seems that the famous comedy writer-director Francis Veber has too many fans or followers in Bollywood. A few years back David Dhawan made his DO KNOT DISTURB (2009) inspired from Francis's THE VALET (2006), and now we have an official remake of one of his most famous movies which has been remade more than thrice. After its first release in 1973 directed by Edouard Molinaro (in French), the film was remade by Billy Wilder in English with the title BUDDY BUDDY in 1981. Director Kartal Tiber made it in Turkish in 1982 calling it BAS BELASI. And Francis himself directed its French remake with the same title in 2008.Unfortunately the latest Indian remake of the cult comedy remains the worthless of them all without offering any kind of entertainment in its short duration. The original story revolves around a Hit man who checks into a hotel right in front of the court to shoot his given target. But his adjoining room is taken by a frustrated man who wishes to kill himself after a broken affair. Now how this man becomes an obstacle in the Hetman's mission is the whole gist of the movie. It's a black comedy which has many interesting sequences in its 1973 and 1981 versions. But in BUMBOO the writers fail to impress completely with their deliberately added tracks such as the scenes in the police van which were not there in the original. Moreover with an all over the top & amateurish climax it becomes a painful experience bought for a price.Debutant director Jagdish Rajpurohit, who also plays a cameo in the film, tries too hard to make you laugh, which doesn't work at all. The execution of its various (supposed to be funny) sequences is unimpressively over stretched which is unable to generate any kind of laughter among the audience. Apart from the direction the main culprit behind the failure of this remake is its inappropriate casting wherein Sharat Saxena doesn't fit into the lead role of a helpless hit-man at all. Kavin Dave has only got the funny looks but hasn't got the other essential elements to feature in a comic movie. Sudhir Pandey once again overacts in his short role. But only Sanjay Mishra is the one who gives you some good moments in this bizarre attempt. Musically the film has nothing to offer just as its script. In short, Bumboo is one of those lousy remakes which ruin the magic of watching their original hits. So better avoid it and go for any of its earlier versions, preferably the very first one made in 1973.\n",

            "Exciting things are afoot in Indian cinema: a new cadre of filmmakers has appeared over the past ten years and is using the cinematic medium in fresh, innovative ways for a specific urban audience. Even the language they use is new: big cities like Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore, and Madras have always displayed a propensity for English, albeit an English infiltrated by peculiarly Indian locutions and idioms. Urban folk switch back and forth between Indian English and the vernacular depending on the situation and conversation partner. A curious linguistic hybrid has sprung up: Hinglish-a blend of English and Hindi-and the new breed of filmmakers allows their characters to speak in this energetic, all-embracing patois to grant them greater relevance and immediacy for the urban Indian viewer. Films like `English August', `Bombay Boys', `Split Wide Open' may not have been outstanding films, but they broke new ground in terms of subject, approach, and characterization; they unapologetically reflected the metropolitan mind-set and made no attempt to be all things to all people, for they probably would never play in small towns or villages. However, international audiences would relate to these films for they described life in the big city, and city dwellers, regardless of geography, share a complicity with other city dwellers. Thus these films have become staples of the international film festival circuit.Nagesh Kukunoor belongs to this class of filmmaker and made his debut with `Hyderabad Blues', followed it up with `Bollywood Calling' and `Rockford', and now has presented us with `Teen Deewarein' (Three Walls). I have not seen the films that preceded `Teen Deewarein', but if this effort is anything to go by, Mr. Kukunoor is well on his way to becoming one of the new auteurs of Indian cinema. He has written, produced, directed, and if this were not enough, cast himself in one of the lead roles in `Teen Deewarein'!  Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, and Juhi Chawla--the headliners--are well-known names in Indian cinema; what's new, however, is that Jackie and Juhi have never before attempted cinema of this sort. For years, Jackie was a stalwart leading man of Hindi films, singing, fighting, and romancing his way through several identical, lucrative, yet undistinguished potboilers. Likewise, Juhi has been a capable, if standard, leading lady: glamorous, competent, but never truly challenged by her roles. Also, she was made to simper and giggle in far too many films for my liking. Naseeruddin Shah, however, has made a career of doing daring and different roles; he switches back and forth, seemingly without effort, between lead and character roles, and has frequently appeared in experimental films. He had great fun as the boorish, scary underworld don who turns filmmaker in `Bombay Boys', and just as easily, was the emotional core and the conscience of Mira Nair's `Monsoon Wedding'. Ishaan (Naseeruddin Shah), Jaggu (Jackie Shroff), and Nagya (Nagesh Kukunoor) are a prison's three inmates on death row. Gulshan Grover is the humane warden attempting reform of the archaic penitentiary system, while Juhi plays Chandrika, a filmmaker making a documentary on death-row prisoners. The three men are each accused of killing a woman: Jaggu is alleged to have stabbed to death his adulterous spouse, Nagya is accused of pushing his wife under an oncoming truck, while Ishaan has accidentally shot a pregnant teller in a botched bank robbery. The three men cannot be more different in character and in their responses to the death sentence. Jaggu, overcome by remorse, wishes to embrace death in atonement for a crime against society. Nagya stoutly denies having pushed his wife and steadfastly believes that truth will prevail, despite the fact that the execution date looms closer with every passing day. Ishaan, the only career criminal of the three, maintains a cheerful outlook and prepares to break out of prison because he doesn't believe he should be put to death for an accidental killing. Chandrika manages to get permission to interview and film the three men, and as time progresses, gains their trust. We see how each of these characters is a prisoner--the three men are literally behind bars, while the filmmaker is trapped in a horrible marriage. Once these four characters come together, we get uncontrived ruminations on life, death, love, and relationships. Juhi switches her camera on and unobtrusively elicits her subjects' life stories and philosophies. The men respond to her gentle approach and open up gradually and pour out their hearts to her non-judgmental camera.Despite the fact that the prison warden has put many reforms into place, it is still a prison, and we see the dehumanizing effects of incarceration. As always, the strong pick on the weak, and predators have their choice of prey, for there is nowhere to run. A homosexual rape takes place, but the HIV-positive rapist gets off with a beating; his brother is a member of the state legislative assembly and his clout extends to the prison system. As the days go by, the documentarian finds her objectivity getting compromised. Through her, we get to know the men, and find it impossible to impersonally look at them as prisoners who are about to get what they deserve.Outstandingly well-written in a seamless mix of English, Hindi, and Hyderabadi dialect, the film is equal parts polemic against the death penalty, human interest story, and quite unexpectedly, suspense thriller. It is photographed in a gritty unglamorous manner, probably on digital video, with much steadicam use, so that we walk beside the prisoners and feel their claustrophobia and despondency. The leads, blessed with a literate, intelligent script, offer up detailed character studies. Naseeruddin Shah, like the great Charlotte Rampling, merits the prefix `the always amazing'. His Ishaan is a complex, paradoxical creature-shot through with a rumpled charm, he is a self-serving grifter and an ace at camouflaging his true emotions, but there is unpredictable decency, as well. The surprises, for me, were Jackie Shroff and Juhi Chawla, who, happily, have strayed far from the safe and known domain of conventional commercial Hindi cinema. Jackie turns in a finely nuanced performance of a man who regrets having committed a crime of passion. As a successful lawyer, Jaggu is the most educated of the three and late at night, he ruefully composes melancholy poetry to soothe his troubled soul. Juhi Chawla is a revelation. Gone are the juvenile giggles and irritating mannerisms; with this role, Juhi has stepped into glorious maturity and tackles a role fraught with adult problems and issues. Perhaps realizing her lot is not much different from the prisoners, her face registers outrage at their plight and the corruption-filled higher echelons of the system. Chandrika convincingly makes the transition from impartial spectator and archivist to outspoken activist. Her new political awareness empowers her to stand up to her abusive husband; in fact, the confrontation scene is a highlight of the film.Nagesh Kukunoor deserves a paragraph of his own. This over-achieving, hardworking young man has conceived of a most novel story, produced with great flair, and directed with enormous sensitivity and cunning a film that will be remembered for a long time. He had the good sense to populate his film with outstanding actors, and it is here, unfortunately, that his shortcomings as a performer surface. Had there been merely mediocre actors around him, Nagesh Kukunoor would probably have shone. However, in the august company of Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Juhi Chawla, and Gulshan Grover, he is shown to be the acting rookie that he is. This is a very minor quibble, for his acting is not bad at all. I just feel he had enough on his plate already, and should have cast another, more seasoned actor in the role of Nagya. It would have taken the film up another notch, but in the face of so much excellence, it is a very small cavil. `Teen Deewarein' is a most satisfying film experience.if only it had been accorded the good fortune of a big release that undeserving schlock like `Mein Prem Ki Deewani Hoon' received, it might have made the world's movie-going public sit up and take notice. If only, if only.\n",

There was not a single instance in the movie which I did not like & honestly speaking the excessive songs and all is perhaps the only reason which prevents me from giving it a perfect 10. The entire setting with a group of four friends with their typical characters & their fun at school life was very refreshing and indeed very pleasant to watch.......The lead female- Hazel Croney was simple superb..... If I recall correct- there was this another teen movie which had released around the same time as this one- \"Teree Sang\" and there was a huge difference between the presentation of the two films though it had Ruslan Mumtaaz in common. Now, I wonder why this movie was not a success at the box office!!! It certainly deserves much more than what it's reception at the box office was. Typical things going through a teenage kids mind like- pornography, the urge to drive before being eligible for the driver's license, bunking school, playing pranks, rivalry amongst classmates was very good to see and it certainly gave the feeling to be back in school. Truly, A very underrated movie. And would like to say it once again.... \"If love in school life can be so beautiful, I guess I've missed out on some wonderful moments that could be possible in a school boys' life!\"\n",

            "OK, so I heard this film mentioned as not one of the best in Shahrukh's filmography but quite unexpectedly, I enjoyed it. It starts a bit unevenly, takes some time to finally get to the story but then the story unfolds quite smoothly.The best things about this movie are Sonali Bendre and the boy. Well, and Shahrukh, of course, but Sonali and the boy are sort of the focus of the story. Sonali is very beautiful and can really emote quite well. She is very charming and likable, as is her character. The boy was adorable and moved me to tears in a couple of scenes.Yes, one reason for which I liked this film was that it was actually very touching and heartfelt in several scenes. It's a wee bit naive and innocent but I like that. Most of all, it's simple and honest. Anyway, one thing this film is not -- it's not boring, which is what I hate most of all in a movie. The story is quite solid, there are drama and conflict, which to me seemed realistic enough. There are flaws, of course, but, really, I had expected something much worse.Shahrukh doesn't do all that much (except being great as usual) but he definitely added to the poignancy of the situation. His interaction with the boy was very cute and touching and I probably wouldn't feel half so much if it weren't for him. As a matter of fact, I only watched it as part of going through SRK's filmography.\n",

            "The third installment of Indra Kumar's sex comedy franchise is nowhere near the zenith that it should have reached by now, considering the perverted times we live in. It has only degraded with time.Amar (Deshmukh), Meet (Oberoi), and Prem (Shivdasani) are three sex- craving husbands of equally sex-craving and seductive \"housewives\". However, the couples are apparently unable to get on with it due to some ridiculous reasons. So, the male trio go out of their way to Amar's ancestral mansion in the countryside to have some adult fun. To their surprise, they bump into Ragini (Rautela), a bombshell of a ghost who, for their luck and goodness, wants to have sex with them for some more ridiculous reasons. In between this narrative is where one will find deadpan jokes and slapstick about sex, vulgarity, sex, women, sex, male reproductive organs, sex, and other similar topics.Masti (2004) was an honestly funny yet average movie, but more than a decade later, Great Grand Masti does not appeal, let only amuse. The characters look like they were written by naughty fourty-four-year olds. The humor, which is supposed to be an important aspect of a film like this, does not even scramble. Lots of cleavages, redundant one-liners, and sexist jokes are all that you'll find in this cacophony of idiotic elements.BOTTOM LINE: Great Grand Masti offers neither of the adjectives that it has appended in its title. It's just a very bad adult film made by a film student who himself is obsessed with sex. Not even worth watching the TV premiere (if at all that happens).Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "A David Dhawan film is always a David Dhawan film - comic, silly, frivolous, and yet very entertaining. What you expect is what you get, no surprises here. I found some of his movies really awesome. Some of them were unbearable and some were decent. Yeh Hai Jalwa belongs to the latter category, it is a solid comic ride which unites two actors, Rishi Kapoor and Salman Khan. Khan plays his illegitimate son who was born before Kapoor married another woman who is not his mother. Now he travels from India to London to meet his father, but the latter refuses to accept him given his high reputation and family, which includes a beautiful wife and two children. But Salman won't leave it at that. Yeh Hai Jalwa is thoroughly fun to watch, and like most films directed by David Dhawan, it never takes itself too seriously. Salman Khan is very funny in his role. Rishi Kapoor too is excellent and I must note that I find him far better as a character actor than in his days as a leading hero. The supporting cast includes the pretty Amisha Patel, the hilarious Anupam Kher, the fantastic Kader Khan, and the ever beautiful Rati Agnihotri. All of them make this movie a worthy and enjoyable picture, which may not be Dhawan's best, but certainly deserves to be seen.\n",

Unfortunately these days he has fallen on hard times, I thought Pardes was average, Taal was a bore, Yaadein was awful and Kisna was no better. The main influence for Ram Lakhan was the 1975 Yash Chopra classic Dewaar. Subhash Ghai however added his own unique touches to the story.The story was that of two brothers Ram and Lakhan (Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor) who live with their parents ( Dilip Tahil and Rakhee Gulzar) and their grandfather. Their grandfather dies but before he died he mistakingly signed an agreement saying that his property would go to Amrish Puri. They get forced out of their house and then Dilip Tahil dies leaving Rakhee to bring up her sons on her own.Years later Jackie Shroff becomes a police inspector and Anil Kapoor is a good for nothing. Seduced by money Anil Kapoor starts working for Amrish Puri and his smuggling racket. When Ram finds out they fall out. It soon transpire that Lakhan is only working for Amrish Puri so that he could get their house back. Cue lots of fun, songs and action. The songs are just fabulous. My favourites are My name is Lakhan or mere do anmol ratan. The scripting was great, all the actors performed well. Rakhee Gulzar as their Mother stole the show as the vengeful mother, in fact she got stuck in that role (Sugandh, Karan Arjun, Baazigar, Solider, Sham Ghanshyam). Awesome, simply awesome.\n",

I wasn't too keen on first when I heard Monica was cast opposite Dutt, but she wasn't that bad. She looks very pretty if she gets some good roles, she might make it in Bollywood. Pooja Batra does well in her cameo song.Anupam Kher, Ashish Vidhiyarti, Mukesh Rishi, Siyaji Shinde, Shakti Kapoor, Sanjay Narveraker (Dedh Phutia of Vaastav) lend good support.

Even the adult jokes seemed to be harsh. Not only that, but the characters weren't ethical enough to connect to. However, as it progressed, so did the laughs, also did Saif Ali Khan with his brilliant acting. Most of the comedy on the movie lies with him on screen. The story was not at all sad. It was coming-of-age. It was different. Spoiler ahead - We have always wanted to watch stories that are different, but at the end come together. With this, I remember Stranger Things, where everyone used to start figuring out on the own and then reach at the same path together. This is different too. In this, you'll see three different stories that, at the end, connect to each other. It's breathtaking.

            "Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla, two big stars of the late 1980-90s, vied for top slots in an industry which has a common habit of pitting one star against the other. But they actually were so different. The former is a huge megastar, quite a cultural icon, charismatic and sincere in her screen portrayals, a stupendous dancer and amazingly beautiful. The latter is quirky, very beautiful and attractive, a natural performer known for her bubbly personality, and above all a gifted comedienne who later upgraded her talent with phenomenal performances in offbeat films. While later decades saw rivals of sorts often act together in films (see the famous Preity Zinta-Rani Mukerji pairing in many films where most of the time the former somehow got better parts), Dixit and Chawla never worked together.And you would expect that when the time came to cast them together in a film, these two formidable ladies would be given something at least as good as much of the stuff coming out today in Hindi cinema. But sadly, the filmmakers took these two stars and, in a weird sort of choice, decided to keep the film in the 1990s in terms of both style and narrative as well as stereotypes that come with it. Gulaab Gang is supposedly based on the real-life vigilante female group Gulabi Gang. Now, I know that many consider this group of women quite heroic, but I wouldn't think of turning them into wild action stars on film. While the film has some great colour and cinematographic work, it is amazingly regressive in terms of filmmaking and the ladies can't help it enough. Or maybe they can? Well, partly.So, Dixit's charisma is undoubted, and she sure is an actress who knows her stuff. She is very good here but then she is clearly not very good at picking her films. In an age when contemporaries have been able to enjoy the benefits of the changing face of Indian cinema and experiment with better roles, she picks a part which is supposedly based on a real-life figure but eventually is just a recap of countless roles played by Hindi film heroines in the 1980s and early 1990s. The action sequences are really ridiculous in their absurdity. It almost feels like Hindi cinema went a few decades back in a weird tribute to the horrendous films made back then. Worse even is the quality of the dance numbers, which do not exhibit the real dancing skills of the great dancing queen that is Madhuri Dixit.Juhi Chawla, on the other hand, is tremendous. It's amazing how brilliantly she manages to maintain her famous, lovably vivacious persona while playing a monstrous woman so immoral and drunk with power, and make it feel so real. Her every expression is a sight to behold, and the hidden intentions in her smiles are quite chilling. It's a feat that only a natural performer like Chawla can achieve, of being both enjoyable and quite intimidating in this otherwise stereotypical part, and she is doubtlessly the film's ultimate star whose absence from the screen makes the show almost worthless. Between the fake action sequences and the clichéd proceedings, she becomes Gulaab Gang's sole redeeming quality. You almost love to hate her. Watch this film for her ceaselessly entertaining villainous turn.\n",

The Tamil filmdom thinks that old people can only be character actors. In our films even old male actors with fading faces have to act as lovers of heroines of their daughters' age. It is sometimes pathetic to see the old heavy actors making some dance sequences. So it is refreshing to see the old couple both in their mild and mature flirting with care for each other and the poignancy of their tragedy of the murder of their son and subsequent legal shenanigans. It is the younger men are the character actors in this film.Amitab Bachan and Sharmila Tagore act brilliantly bringing the gamut of emotions. The final meeting with the murderer was excellent. Of course the story line is linear and some excellent pieces of dialogue crop up.Yet there are a few rather typical cinematic scenes which are rather incongruous The old lady who is a retired teacher goes out with her teacher's cane and beats up the roguish Ali and others to bring some sense of decency in them which is rather too dramatic. Similarly the last verdict of NOT GUILTY on the old man is rather surprising. I am not a lawyer and am not aware of judicial nuances. But after all the old man is a murderer however justifiable his actions are and some token punishment (at least the time spent in the prison so far) would have been more judicial. Besides during the first trial the Home Minister and the Police went far out of the way in harassing Patwrdhan and his family but after his son's death the Home Minister seem to have been paralyzed. Nobody even tried to confiscate the tape recorder which ultimately reaches the presiding Judge of the second trial -\"a shocking piece of evidence\". The police officer who foisted the Drugs in the son's bedroom seemed to have gone scot-free.But for these loose ends, deliberately left for dramatic purposes, Viruddh is a very good and interesting film.\n",

            "I thought it was an Indianized version of Lord Jim, which was itself based on the true story of the abandonment of a ship called PATNA! In Lord Jim too the protagonist lives with the fact of his own cowardice and eventually redeems himself by taking on ugly forces that prey on the poor and weak. Kaala Paththar had two other men in the story - and followed the usual 70s/80s cliché of the man with the criminal background having to die in the end. But it was also quite uncliched in having no overt romantic track between Shashi and Parveen Babi, and a very quiet connection between Amitabh and Rakhi. Rakhi never enunciated well in Hindi and it got worse in moments of agitation. Here she did not have to speak much and was OK. I always liked Neetu Singh and she was good in this one too. Shatru was never a favorite but he was quite restrained here IMO. For a film from the 70s, this was indeed quite a different one and I enjoyed it. Amitabh was excellent as the coward, then the slowly burning up with self-disgust man, and finally as the hero. The mine disaster was well shot and the dark and claustrophobic kind of picturization made is seem realistic. There were not really many songs to disrupt the narrative - another unique feature for a film of its time. Fr instance, no sad number with wailing violins as the hero sits and stares at the stars and broods over his past! I gave it 8/10.\n",

            "If you're neither a fan of (Amitabh Bachchan), nor the commercial Indian cinema, get out of here quickly, because it's a case where only the lovers of the above-mentioned will understand what I'm going to say!What's cinema?! Actually a lot of things. One important ruling thing of them is the power of the illusion, the great effect of the fancy, the fantastic fascinating visionary magic which could conquer the eyes, the hearts, and the minds eternally. It's not an essay about the beauty of cinema. It's a beautiful fact about it which all the cinemas around the world utilized it to make joy, to make art, to make profits, whatever!So, some of us, believe me; it's all of us, fall in love with the most stupid movie in the world. Whether that was your idea about it, or else's idea. And during all my life, I found a lot of sane people, including me, who have such a fine taste and in the same time just adore one ridiculous, foolish, lousy movie. However you won't objectively negotiate too much, or at all, with its lovers, because you've been there my friend, and you passed the state of \"it's unbelievable, but HEY it's fun!\" before, and perhaps so many times too. It differs from one to another, whereas the name of it (guilty pleasure, enjoyable nonsense.. etc), or the reason why (the childhood memories, the movie's realization of your impossible dreams, holy love for one thing or one person in the movie, compensating something that isn't in your life anymore.. and so on), or the causes of hideousness (absurd writing, shoddy directing, dull acting.. It's endless list of what could make your beloved movie the worst ever for all the mankind except you!). So what about ()Major Saab) not for all the mankind, but for me?It's fun. Yes, my importunate brain tells me it's not, but in a time like this, my heart belongs to daddy, I mean this movie! Really after years and years of watching (Bachchan) as the ever angry young man who's searching for his lost: brother, sister, mother, father, or sometimes all of them together! Now the man has had it, like us to tell you the truth, and after few years of retirement, he became an older angry man who - for example - acts as the severe mentor not as the noisy rebel, and that was catchy to watch.It's all about difficult love story, and how the young spoiled brat became that strong fighter who can win his love and defend it successfully, thanks to the Indian militaristic academy (the patriotic tone is so high in here). I loved so many things such as seeing (Bachchan) as a charismatic middle-aged major, and wounded father who lost a son and wants to raise another yet by cruelty!, the actress who played his affectionate wife, the wonderful (son & father) relationship between the kid and his mentor, and the dreamy ending. Not to forget some marvelous cinematography, and fervent as well as poetic editing.Plus some magical moments indeed: The first emergence of (Bachchan) as a steely officer, the beaten kid struggles to crawl to the academy's door by the encouragement of his major, the musical meeting of the lovers at the mountain; which I thought for seconds that it's another boring romantic Indian song, but it turned out to be a romantic surprise as one delicate scene just about the charm of love in the air, the song / montage about the kid's training to cure himself from his injuries and to build his will; where there is a unique harmony between image and sound. In fact, this commercial movie has few songs which are rarely essential - if you know about that kind of movies' old formula - and not that boring or unnecessary, just remember the song when the lead and his girl were singing in front of her family instead of a long statement about their love. In brief, we love this even if it's all out of the musical genre!BUT on the other hand (OH BOY my brain is her to revenge, runaway all the lovers of the movie!) you'll find some of the aforementioned as the corniest, silliest.. Whatever the things which give your simple love a hard time: The unbelievable events when (Bachchan) bursts into the girl's wedding with his armed ground forces, attacking her family by cannons!!, so the end's weirdest board ever, about the execution of the major and his cadet (read by Bachchan himself?!) because what they have done! It's maybe an action that was forced by the censorship to warn anyone who tries to defend his love by guns!, or to make sure that the high commanders, like (Bachchan) in the movie, can't get away with it! But obviously that ruined the whole thing! Otherwise it's some satire about how the forces of injustice and corruption are more powerful than any idealistic defender of love (Hmmm.. too far I know!). So no need at all to talk about how bad the wig of (Bachchan) was, how dull the action scene at the cave seemed, and how frigid (Ajay Devgan) was!So, if you can turn off your sense of logic, then you'll be more than capable of having a real good time with that nice well-meaning dream.\n",

She heaves a sigh of relief after one of her co-worker,Akshay, rescues and takes her away from the wing of dirty politician. However, their happiness is short-lived as the politician discovers their hide-out and strangles them to death. Luckily , Sonika survives the attempted murder and avenges the killing of her boyfriend.First time director, Vishal Pandya does a fine job in keeping audience on their toes with Hate Story 2. What works is the cat-mouse game between Surveen Chawla and Sushant Singh and engaging moments in the film along with melodious music and commendable performances. The romantic track between Surveen Chawla and Jay Bhanusali is half-baked with less-impacting climax which could have been better. Screenplay is average. Cinematography is good. Art direction is decent. Surveen Chawla gives a brilliant performance as a woman who wrecks vengeance on so- called godfather. Sushant Singh is outstanding as a corrupt and selfish politician.Overall, Hate Story 2 does have few moments to keep you engaged. Decent 2.75/5\n",

The movie is a love story of a spy as the name suggests.If you can imagine Sunny looking different in his make ups, then you might understand on what basis the movie has been made.Pritey Zinta delivers a good performance.The rest of the cast gives in their hard work and Amrish Puri yet again proves that he is the best Villain there is.Songs are average while the action sequences(especially with the wrestler in the lab in Canada is rocking!!!)are just too good.Allan Amin yet again proves his modern mind and his outlook.

Ricky Riker (Drake Bell) is a typical teenager, except that his luck is worse then most. Basically, he's a loser. He's been in love with beautiful Jill (Sara Paxton) for years, but is sure she doesn't know he exists. Even his best friend, Trey (Kevin Hart), is willing to throw him over for another clique. But Rick's life changes dramatically when a genetically enhanced dragonfly bites him during a school field trip. In a flash, he becomes the Dragonfly. He can scale buildings, and has immense strength--though he's still a klutz. Rick isn't sure he has what it takes to be a superhero, but it's up to him to save the city from the villainous Hourglass (Christopher McDonald), who literally sucks the life out of people, and threatens to harm those dearest to Rick.

Being the first stereoscopic film of India, this scary tale, offers scary moments all through and holds you with it's interesting screenplay. Fear, indeed goes 3D! 'Haunted 3D' tells the story of Rehan, played by Mahaakshay, a real-estate broker, who comes to sell an ancient haunted mansion in a secluded hill-station, but later finds out there is more to this mansion than expected.Amin Hajee's Writing in the First-Hour is superb! The haunting the protagonist goes through, throw chills down your spine & keeps your interest alive. In the second hour, an unexpected twist happens and only gathers it's momentum and reaches to a long, yet good culmination.Vikram Bhatt is a Master when it comes to Making Horror Flicks, and 'Haunted 3D' proves that fact yet again. This one's a terrific horror flick, that is eerie, creepy & interesting at the same time. The 3D effects are quite good.Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is fine. Music is wonderful, each song has a feel to it.Performance-Wise: Mahaakshay, earlier known as Mimoh, who debuted in 'Jimmy' a few years back, shows vast improvement in here. As the Main Hero, the lad delivers a sincere performance from start to end. Debutant Tia Bajpai is quite good. Achint Kaur leaves a lasting impression. Arif Zakaria is fantastic! The actor manages to cause a terror within you each time he appears on screen! Mohan Kapoor is fair.

            "Pradeep Sarkar,surprised and impressed many veterans of the industry with his subtle sensibilities in \"Parineeta\". And after his debacle of \"Laaga Chunri Mein Daag\", he had to do something out of the routine to prove his mastery over the medium once again.But after watching his latest movie, I was quite shocked and confused since it turned out to be a completely unexpectedly below average show from the talented director.In simple words, LP proves to be the weakest film of its entire star- cast and the director, except KK and Piyush Mishra. The way a good concept has been executed on the screen is not able to convince. The script is highly predictable wherein everything keeps on happening so easily without any hassle or difficulty. And the most surprising factor is that LP lacks the real emotional depth which was in fact the forte of its director Pradeep Sarkar.In support of my big disappointment from the movie, here are some points I would like to mention:1. The whole film moves at the same lazy pace with no acceleration of any kind, despite of the fact that its climax is written around a famous Reality Show Finale.2. Deepika loses her eyesight due to an accident and this serious issue of getting blind doesn't even get a single emotional scene where the truth is revealed to her. Deepika shows no repulsion from her side to her blindness and just starts practicing her skating again. It was indeed very shocking to see a serious issue of losing the eyes taken so lightly by the script writer and the director.3. The moment Deepika accepts her disability and decides to fight back, the viewer can easily predict the complete movie till the end. 4. All the sequences wherein Deepika is being taught to learn the art of looking without her eyes are too easy to believe and digest. Besides this she also learns the tricks so fast, in just few days without any severe training given by some specialized master.5. The reference to an ongoing reality show \"India's Got Talent\" remains the most ineffective part of the movie, in absence of any excitement or interesting nail biting moments. Further, the finale of the show featuring 3 guest judges,Shamaik, Juhi and Javed Jaffery is shot in such a childish way where the judges don't even get a single line to say and the couple is just assumed to be the winners. Moreover their trophy is also delivered to them by their friends in a different scene later on.6. The computer graphics used in the accident and sound training sequence around the bells surely could have been much better in this big budget movie.7. The movie finishes off on a very low note and leaves no impact of any kind on the viewer. Neither the audience feel emotionally connected to the characters nor they feel extremely happy for the couple on their grand win.8. Lastly the film was highly publicized in the media as a thriller with some dare devil stunts performed by Neil and other bikers. But the stunts are hardly there and it cannot be called a thriller from any angle. Also along with its strange title, several other elements in the script like the boxing fight sequences, the underworld angle in the storyline and the characterization of Neil-Deepika's close friends remain tasteless as some half baked pieces of the cake.Apart from these, the other two departments in which LAGANGE PARINDEY fails to impress are its performances and music. Choosing Neil as a Tapori was the biggest mistake of the casting team. Though he tries hard to look and speak like his character, but his overall personality doesn't permit you to believe that he is a tapori. Many of the readers, familiar with the Golden Years of Hindi Films would readily agree that using Neil as a tapori boy was just like using Pradeep Kumar in a role of a beggar. (The famous actor had the killer looks of a rich, millionaire person and nobody could ever imagine him in the role of a poor man.)Deepika also tries her best to put up a good show but her over confidence clearly shows on the face which turns her otherwise OK performance into an average one. A blind girl portrayed by Deepika never gives you any signs of grief, discontentment and pain which seem to be quite superficial. Besides this, even after losing the eyesight, her fashion sense, her make-up and her body hugging outfits questionably remain intact, which the director tries to justify by giving her a close female friend. The investigating officer & all the actors in the friend circle are good but they sadly don't get any meatier scenes to make their presence felt. So, it all comes to only KK and Piyush Mishra. But unfortunately KK is there for only 3-4 minutes and Piyush Mishra keeps coming after long painful gaps.Musically the soundtrack is not as per the standards of a Pradeep Sarkar movie. I wonder why he didn't repeat his earlier music director Shantanu Moitra who did a nice job in both his precious movies. Talking about the main story plot of the film, many viewers may find it similar to Rajesh hanna's \"Dushmun\",Gulzar's \"Kinara\" and more recently Anubahv Sinha's \"Tum Bin\".In nutshell, the movie was indeed an unexpected letdown for me as I couldn't find Pradeep Sarkar anywhere in the film till the end. So, you can watch it if you are a fan of Neil or Deepika, but don't go for it expecting a high paced thriller from the director of \"Parineeta\".\n",

            "Another remarkable cop drama in the line of -Ardha satya/ Shool/ Sarfarosh and Ab Tak Chhappan. Though hard-hitting and realistic, it is definitely different in the sense that here more than protagonist waging a war against system or dealing with the rampant corruption or getting into a jingoistic, heavy dialog baazi he rather gets into the nitty-gritty of nabbing an underworld Don of UP. Also it exposes the nexus between politicians, administrators, businessmen, mafia and the police quite effortlessly. To don both the caps of writer and director is nonetheless a rare feat for a débutant and ad filmmaker turned film director Kabir Kaushik comes out with flying colors. The cinematography (R.A.Krishnaa), editing (Amitabh Shukla), art direction (Narendra Rahurikar), locales, the dialogs, sound design (Biswadeep Chatterji), stunt sequences (Parveiz Fazal Khan), music (Daniel B. George) all deserve a special mention in giving film a required rawness and creating a tense environment. The film manages to strike a fine balance between realistic cinema and mainstream cinema, which is an uphill task, and come across as an intelligent film. Though it has some flaws too like the overall tone of the film is far too serious than is required and tempo drops at places. It is sad to see honest cops dying one by one. Even the end is depressing. Among performances, Arshad Warsi is fabulous in his underplayed mannerisms (his best till date). Portrayal of Villain (Sushant Singh) as a cool headed guy who does not loose his temper in worst of situations, matches rightly up to him. Others are equally competent though Mahima Chaudhary's styling needs to be toned down a bit. Thankfully there are no forced songs in the way of narration. This film adds to the list of new cinema emerged in past few months which is a welcome relief from the tried and tested path and will definitely be remembered as one of the best films released this year.\n",

The movie covers the events leading up to the gas tragedy & the actual tragedy itself. A journalist named Motwani(Kal Penn), wants to expose Union Carbide Corporation for building a chemical industrial plant right in the middle of Bhopal. He takes the help of American journalist Eva Gascon(Mischa Barton), to bring down Union Carbide & its CEO, Warren Anderson(Martin Sheen), before it's too late. The movie also revolves around Dilip(Rajpal Yadav), who works for Union Carbide. Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a brilliant film! The first half of the movie is a little dragging. However, the second half of the movie more than makes up for it. The scenes of the film involving the gas leak & its effects are gut wrenching & heart breaking at the same time. I'm glad that director Ravi Kumar did not shy away from showing us what exactly happened on that fateful night. The performances are the highlight of the film. Kal Penn is spectacular as Motwani. Martin Sheen is outstanding as Warren Anderson. Mischa Barton is impressive as Eva Gascon. However, the standout performer of the film is without a doubt, Rajpal Yadav as Dilip. Yadav's character is the heart & soul of the film & can make us experience a whirlwind of emotions. Tannishtha Chatterjee is good as Leela. The supporting characters are great as well.

            "Section 375 - A rape is registered, a woman is violated and trampled by a person in superior position, and for the ease of understanding, it's the film industry that's in focus. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and others are people against whom the #MeToo movement began in Hollywood that later spread like a wildfire in India too. The film director in Section 375 played by Rahul Bhat strongly denies the allegations of the junior costume designer but there is almost infallible evidence against him, good enough for his conviction.With a running time of 125 minutes, the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat as the courtroom drama swings from one end of the spectrum to the other. Truth is often stranger than fiction and lawyers are in the business of law, not justice. Akshay Khanna delivers yet another superlative performance in the role of the suave, smooth talking and convincing defense lawyer, fighting a case that's all but lost, battling public and media fury on the one hand and opposition at home too. Richa Chadha is not exactly spectacular as the public prosecutor, somewhat undermined by her flawed dialogue delivery that sounds monotonous, but quite formidable in her upright mannerisms and conviction of the rape. The director manages to unfold the suspense slowly and logically, keeping the consequence and judgement open to debate, interpretation and it's for you to take sides.Section 375 is deeply disturbing with graphic violence, uncomfortable interrogation of the victim in the courtroom, a botched police investigation and a judiciary under social turbulence. The subject is contemporary and of significant relevance in workplace, any for that matter. It has a message that needs to be absorbed amid all the throbbing drama where sympathy may change sides. If you don't enjoy depth and detail or are looking for entertainment, give Section 375 a miss. But if you like serious narrative, in-depth analysis, crevices of law and human psychology, please watch the film for a very rewarding mental stimulus.\n",

I am sure the director Sujoy Ghosh has spent more time on pre-production (special mention - script) before embarking upon hitting the movie on the floors. Obvious references that might crop are to Dil Chahta Hain which was a story of 3-friends. Here we have 3-couples perfectly characterized into different slots. Couple One: Sanjay Suri & Juhi Chawla representing the upper-middle class of society, expecting their second child. Couple Two: Rahul Bose & Rinkie Khanna representing the modern urban couple on the verge of divorce. Couple Three: Shayan Munshi & Riya Sen representing the teenagers in love, the hero's love and reluctance and the girl's acceptance.Interlaced around these are the episodes of ad-agency where the three hero's work on a common assignment, conniving next-door ad-agency competitor, the nose-digger prospective client, spiritual next-door neighbor sex guru, the painful divorce process, nagging mother-in-law and finally Rahul Bose's car. The common passion for R D Burman's music and preparation for the competition forms the backbone of the effective storyline.Noteworthy mentioning is loquacious Archana Puran Singh who this time whispers \"mum's the word\". And guess what? Her real-life hubby Paramjeet Singh does not get to share the same frame!All the actors have done their parts extremely well. What stands absolute above all these, is unmistakably the script which is flawless. Perfect emotions blended with good songs and skillful editing makes this movie an entertaining fare.Roll on Sujoy with your next venture. We are waiting.\n",

            "A movie from the house of Rakesh Roshan certainly raises expectations. And the publicity just before the release did add to the excitement. But all pump and show is nothing and the film disappoints in all departments.First of all the movie is completely predictable from the very first scene and it simply goes on with sequences which are just repetition of stuff seen many times before. In a nutshell the story is about some friends witnessing a crime and then the villains keep following them in the rest of the movie. Only this time the novelty is that the four friends are all mental patients who find an opportunity to roam out of their hospital.All the talented artists including Irfan Khan, Rajpal Yadav, Arshad Warsi and Juhi Chawla are just wasted and no one gets any scenes to talk about. Rajpal Yadav is the one who is better among the four patients as the freedom fighter. Arshad Warsi, strangely is not doing any comedy but shows that he can be an angry young man too. Irfan Khan can be seen trying to do the hard work as a mental doctor. Suresh Menon has no dialogues and speaks through his facial expressions. But as the script has nothing for them in store so they all seem to be helpless. The movie is inspired from a 1989 movie \"THE DREAM TEAM\" but it's not at all an impressive copy.The greatest drawback is that it's not a comedy, though it was publicised as a hilarious comedy flick. You keep waiting for comedy scenes to come but they are never there. All the songs come as an interruption and are also not enjoyable at all. The biggest let down is the \"Ek Rupaiya\" song after the interval, which makes you think, why the director chose this song to be there in final print. Only the last scene with some good dialogues is a kind of silver lining in the dark clouds.The biggest asset of the movie \"Shahrukh Khan's Item Number\" is well shot but it alone cannot save the film from sinking. Neither can the dance numbers by Hrithik Roshan and Rakhi Sawant. Rajesh Roshan / Ram Sampat music has nothing to talk about except the item numbers. The pace picks up just before the movie ends and the director tries to imitate a Priyadarshan kind of hilarious climax sequence which falls flat.After you finish the screening you just wonder why Rakesh Roshan backed up this project. In my opinion the talented father and son (Rakesh & Hrithik) knew that they have a weak final product so that is the reason they added 2 item numbers and also had a last moment publicity gimmick of plagiarism.A Big Let Down with a huge difference between the expectations and the final outcome.

            "When I first heard about this movie being made and Sunny Deol being in it, I was really excited, as it was said to be a rivalry of 2 army schools, and I thought (Sunny's role would be perfect). However, over a year later (some months) after the film released, I was really disappointed. The rivalry was over 2 high schools, and Sunny's role was very small, and he was mum most of the time. I really felt bad that Sunny was wasted in this movie, although his get-up as the motorcycle dude was cool. The movie overall was NOT that great, just average. He can actually dance (see the song by Abhijeet). Sunny is a true icon of 'believing in oneself,' but he should have gotten substantial footage. Along with this, if the story was different, this could have been much better and more exciting.\n",

            "Love of humanity follows no caste or creed. The main message of this beautiful film emphasizes this. The central character of this film Dharam Pal(Paresh Rawal) finds out upon the opening of a safe deposit box left by his late mother - that he is a child adopted from a Muslim couple.Having been raised as a Hindu for so long, this comes as a rude awakening to him. He is left in a moral dilemma - whether to confide in his wife or not. He opts not to tell his wife, but confides his secret to his next-door neighbor Nawab Mehmood Shah(Anu Kapoor), who is a lawyer by profession. Nawab Shah helps him to find his real biological father.Upon learning that his father has been found and is seriously ill, Dharam Pal rushes to meet him, but he is stopped by the Imaam who is taking care of his father.He tells Dharampal that if his father saw that his only son has been brought up as a non-Muslim, it could cause severe damage to his health. Therefore, he tells Dharampal to learn how to become a true Muslim and come back to meet his father once he is ready.Watch this excellent film to find out what happens next...The film also stars veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah in the role of Neel Anand Baba.Paresh Rawal Films To See: Woh Chokri, Sir, Sardar, Naam, Kshana Kshanam (1991), Money (1993), Money Money (1995), Govinda Govinda (1994), Rikshavodu (1995), Bavagaru Bagunnara (1998), Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.

Its a clean family film by #nitinkakkar, its also funny, sensible n emotional. The father-child relationship is well depicted. The film clearly shows how every father underestimates his childs potential. The heros character is not a stud, in fact hes good for nothing, yet he makes an impression. Heroine #kritikakamra makes a successful transition from television to the big screen. Hope to see her more often. Good performances, simple dialogues n authentic locations r the plus points.

            "Dutt's 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' (Paper Flower) very much reflects his own life story. It can be described as poetry on canvas as it's beautiful, lyrical, agonizing, heartbreaking and a treat to watch. The legendary Guru Dutt pretty much lived the life of the famous painters whose works gained appreciation only after their tragic departure. Dutt's other masterpiece, 'Pyaasa' parallels this. Sadly, 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' was a commercial failure after its release. Ironically this is also shown in the film as Sinha's last film is a commercial disaster. Both 'Pyaasa' and 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' somewhat parallel this genius's life.The cinematography has always been a highlight of Dutt's films. The use of lighting is very good as it emphasizes the somberness. The light beaming on the screen during the premier of Sinha's 'Devdas' and the spotlight on the main characters during the interval song are examples of the skillful use of light. The overlapping images, the close-ups, and the long-shots all work effectively.Among the songs, it is the unforgettable 'Waqt Ne Kiya', sung by the late Geeta Dutt, that stands out. It's both shot beautifully and the lyrics are magic as it expresses the silent emotions conveyed between the two protagonists. 'Dekhi Zamaane Ki Yaari' is also a good track. The rest of the songs range from okay to adequate. The Johnny Lever track could have easily been left out. The character itself was not really necessary.The relationship between Sinha and his estranged wife seems a little hazy. Perhaps it was a good idea not too put too much focus on them as the film was mainly about Suresh and Shanti's relationship. The characters of Mrs. Sinha and her parents are very caricaturish.The chemistry between the enigmatic Guru Dutt and the luminous Waheeda Rehman is electric. They convey so much without saying anything. As Sinha says, 'We have always understood each other'.While 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' has its flaws (which I think are very few), it is essentially a beautiful powerful classic. The storytelling is simple without being too emotionally manipulative or preachy. 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' is a gift to cinema.\n",

            "Judging by the ratings and having heard the opinions of many people, 'Zamaana Deewana' seems to be one of Shahrukh and Raveena's most disliked films. I wonder why because for me it's total entertainment. Why would anyone expect a movie with such a title to be anything else? Not only does it stay true to its title, it brings together all the Bollywood clichés and molds into a fun movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's where it scores.Speaking of clichés, you'll pretty much see everything to be witnessed in a pre-2000s typical Bollywood film and that's why 'Zamaana Deewana' in a way works as a spoof. Here are some examples: The ongoing feud between the two families caused by a misunderstanding which is followed by parents disapproving their kids relationship, the guy running away with the girl, the over the top action sequences (Shahrukh on his motorbike fighting the goons), 'dishum dishum', the unsuitable boyfriend who drinks, gambles and visits prostitutes, the helpless mom, the evil maternal uncle etc etc. What's notable is that all the sequences are presented with humour. The entire first two hours are hilarious.The songs (and entire soundtrack) deserves special mention. The soundtrack pretty much has all kinds of songs present in a typical Bollywood film and they are filmed quite well. There's a title song, a semi-item number (those weren't so big then), a dream sequence, a parody number, a song in the rain, a song in a car, a song with two desperate lovers, a gypsy song where the two lovers finally realize their love for each other. One particular song 'Soch Liya Maine' is executed that way with several dream sequences that include themes like lovers singing in the snow, in the rain, in the car and even in a tropical jungle. 'Neend Kise Chain Kahan' is one of the most sensual looking songs. The songs themselves are quite pleasant to the ears.'Zamaana Deewana' isn't entirely spoofy. There are some genuine humour like Anupam Kher as the common love interest of the fathers, some very funny one-liners and the moments between Shahrukh and Raveena. It very much works as a multi-genre film as, in addition to the comedy, it's got romance, action, suspense and lots of spice. The last hour could have used more humour as it becomes a tad too dramatic (still using the clichés).Shahrukh Khan and Raveena Tandon totally rock as a pair. Tandon's already well recognized for her comedic abilities and I wish Shahrukh was offered more comedy movies as the actor clearly shows a knack. They are sizzling on screen. Also Raveena's Priya is not the typical Bollywood lover-girl bimbo. She's quite headstrong and smart. Unfortunately, she and Khan have never done a movie since. Anupam Kher is at his funniest and kudos to him for the dance number where he's seducing Shatrughan Sinha and Jeetendra. Jeetendra and Shatrughan Sinha do a good job as the typical disapproving parents who hate each other's guts. The scenes where they cuss at each other is another LOL moment. Tinnu Anand and Asif Sheikh are alright as the caricature villains.So, for me the only flaw is that the last hour is a tad too dramatic and could have used more comedic balance but otherwise this is a typical Bollywood film. I have revisited it after 10 years and still managed to laugh throughout most of the three hours. Why take this film seriously if it doesn't take itself that way?\n",

            "Nandita Das, an actress known for her off-beat choice of movies and remarkable acting skills, wears the cap of a director and gives us a sensitive & thoughtful movie based on aftermaths of the Gujarat Riots, which unfortunately happened in 2002. Last year we had a brilliant movie \"Mumbai Meri Jaan\" which talked about different people who were victims or a part of Mumbai Train Blasts. On the similar lines \"Firaaq\" (means Separation or Judaai) tells stories of few people, their fears and the trauma they face after one month of the miss-happening in the state.Though it may not be liked by mainstream viewers for its artistic treatment, but for a thinking viewer, \"Firaaq\" has depth, emotions and power to make you reconsider, what is the difference between two religions which causes so much hatred and bloodshed? Nandita Das succeeds in generating the empathy impact in the viewer as he witnesses the sequences on the screen. The film and its sensitive direction can make you understand the minute distinction in the words 'sympathy' and 'empathy'. You can feel the pain of victims as if it was all happening around you. And the credit goes to the intelligently written, well directed and brilliantly cinematographed scenes throughout the movie.The first scene itself is the most important and impactful scene of the movie which is capable of generating chills down your spine. It's a graveyard scene where a loaded truck arrives giving more work to the grave diggers who already have enough bodies to bury together. In fact, this is the most powerful scene out of all the movies made on communal riots till date. The last time I felt this way watching anything on screen was when I saw Govind Nihalani's \"Tamas\" many years back. So hats off to Nandita for this particular scene.The movie then moves into different stories of people who witnessed the massacre, and are still haunted by the memory of those black days. Deepti Naval, as a middle class housewife is trapped in the pool of guilt of not helping the persons who came to her house for shelter. And now she is punishing herself each new day, thinking about her cowardly act. Paresh Rawal as her husband is a cunning materialistic person who is more interested in taking advantage of the communal tensions in the city. Shahana Goswami and her friend both earn by inscribing mehndi on the hands of ladies in marriages. How a simple \"bindi\", saves them both from being treated otherwise is worth watching. A group of men manage to get a pistol with only one bullet and that also goes wasted in their own fight. A child gets lost in the big town, roaming around helplessly after all his family members are killed. The story of this child also gets connected with Deepti Naval and she takes him to her home. The conversation scenes between Deepti and the child are the most emotional ones in the movie which prove the immense talent Nandita Sen has got.However there are two stories which stand out and have a lasting impression on the viewer. One is about a Hindu-Muslim couple (Sanjay Suri & Tisca Chopra) who have decided to leave the city after their store was looted and destroyed. Their confrontation dialogues and two minds situation has been shot realistically which touches your soul.The other moving story is about a true old classical singer (Naseeruddin Shah), who still believes that everything is at peace out there and nothing has changed. Raghuvir Yadav is a person serving him for years but he has not got guts to tell Naseer about the brutal killings. Jagjit Singh giving playback to the classical singing of Nasser brought back the memories of \"Mirza Ghalib\" once again. And when Naseer is asked what he can do to stop this, he rightly says with grief, \"Saat Suron Mein Itni Taaqat Kahan Ki Yeh Vehshat Rok Saken\". Very True! Here I would also like to mention a scene I found both emotional and disturbing to a great extent. As Naseer and Raghuvir pass through a road sitting in an autoricksaw, Nasser suddenly asks the driver to stop and comes out looking for something. Actually he is looking for an ancient and ages old mazaar which is not there where it was from years. Raghuvir calms him down explaining that we are on the wrong road and everything is fine. This is another well conceived scene equivalent to the first seen in the start.In acting department everyone is there doing their part perfectly and are also well suited for their roles. Out of all, Naseeruddin Shah & Sanjay Suri stand out with their true to life performances and are a treat to watch. Cinematography is of first rate and plays a major part in giving the realistic touch to the movie.\"Firaaq\" actually, should be seen more as an artistic and thought provoking docu-drama than as a mainstream Hindi movie. After the impressive & shocking start, your expectations rise sky high, which get fulfilled to some extent. But you also feel a little less satisfied as the movie finishes. That deprives \"Firaaq\" to be called an ultimate masterpiece, but still it is a movie which should be watched by everyone as a compulsion and you cannot afford to miss it.That is why it also enters my \"Movies To See Before You Die List\" too.So don't miss it as it is an intelligent and well made gift from the charming Nandita Sen. Would love to see her more works very soon.\n",

Chandrachur singh gives a fantastic performance as a young man who is forced to join a terrorist group run by kulbushan kharbanda and om puri. Its hard to believe that this was the first film of chandrachur singh. Tabu gives a performance which changed her career. She got a national award for this film. Om puri, raj zutshi, jimmy shergill and kulbushan kharbanda give superb performances in the supporting cast. The screenplay/story/dialogues are written by gulzar. As with most gulzar's films , maachis too has story told in form of flashbacks. The script is very engrossing and does not let the viewer move till the end. This movie was banned in some places in punjab & kashmir. It was also send for a re-censor. A cinema hall strike in january 1997 and good publicity of songs meant that this became india's second biggest word-of-mouth hit. This record was only recently beaten by \"Satya\". The first one being \"Sholay\". Gulzar won filmfare award for Best story and Best dialogues. Gulzar also won a national award for the most popular film of the year. This is a must see movie. Like most of gulzar's film this is a CLASSIC.\n",

In the lead role, Rajpal delivers a Remarkable, Tour-De-Force Performance that deserves an ovation. It's among the finest performances from the 2000's! 'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' Synopsis: A short, nondescript man, Mithilesh Shukla marries a tall and beautiful woman. Now jealousy and Mithilesh's own insecurities threaten to wreck his happy home.'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' is a sweet & simple story, that talks about a common man's insecurities. The protagonist Mithilesh Shukla, played by Rajpal, is a person who many can relate to. His jealously, low self-esteem & complexities are relatable to every common man of this country. The Screenplay wonderfully narrates & justifies the story of the common man. Chandan Arora's Direction, is good. Cinematography is perfect. Music is soothing.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Rajpal's performance deserves an ovation. And its truly among the finest performances from the 2000's! As his beautiful & tall wife, Rituparna Sengupta delivers a restrained performance. Kay Kay Menon scores in a brief role. Varun Badola deserves a mention.On the whole, 'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' is an under-rated gem.\n",

            "This is a lovely Indian commercial film. Great songs, nice story, nice script and good actors. The film addresses a rather controversial topic by portraying a very young girl who gets pregnant, and when her boyfriend does not wish to take responsibility for his actions, she firmly decides to give birth to her baby and fight all the social prejudice, including the initial opposition of her own parents. The film is interesting and engaging, but the execution is very poor. The costumes are weird and the film is extremely outdated. Premarital pregnancy is not such a big deal in our times even in India, making the portrayal a bit exaggerated. The film's depiction makes it look like an old picture from the 1980s. Even when Priya dances at the club with her pal, the song that is being played is Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\", which is not bad but is not concurrent with the film's time. Maybe they should have defined the period of time as such, it would have made much more sense. Additionally, Saif Ali Khan's character is inexplicable, Preity Zinta's elder brother's character is too aggressive and Zinta herself does not look the age she is supposed to be. At some points the film is a bit overly melodramatic, which is unnecessary in a film that wants to be issue-based and portray realism.What I did like immensely is the portrayal of a loving, united family. It was very touching and was portrayed well. The scene in which Priya's brothers turn on the video and cry quietly is very moving, however clichéd it may be. This is actually Preity Zinta's very first film and the one which established her as a leading star. She is the soul of the film and injects much energy and freshness into her character. She was not really brilliant as she would be in many of her future films and her voice and diction were pretty problematic at that point of time. Yet she succeeds in breathing as much life as possible into Priya with her boyish charm, bubbly personality and sincere portrayal. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachhur Singh don't impress much, but Farida Jalal and Anupam Kher as her parents are very likable. Rajesh Roshan's soundtrack is one of the main reasons this film has such a colourful and positive feel about it. One very good example is the family song \"Kya Kehna\". Other songs that I particularly enjoyed listening to include \"Dekhiye Aaji Jaanemann\" and \"In Kadmon Ke Neeche\". Well, do watch Kya Kehna. Don't expect to see a brilliant or a particularly realistic film, but do expect to be touched by a very charming Hindi entertainment.\n",

            "Aatish Kapadia's Khichdi: The Movie is based on the popular TV series directed by Kapadia himself. I have not seen the series, but the movie is fantastic. Centring around the crazy Parekh family, it is one of the maddest and funniest Indian films I've seen in recent years. It is terribly mad, but it is terribly entertaining. It is mindless, senseless, brainless, over-the-top, insane and ludicrous, but it's just one movie that hooks the audience from the very first moment and for two hours keeps them laughing non-stop. The viewers do not have to think too much but they will certainly find themselves rolling on the floor on numerous occasions. Well, that's at least what happened to me. One thing is sure: Khichdi is silly, but it actually celebrates its silliness and thus manages to create one truly unforgettable laugh riot.Aatish Kapadia both writes and directs this feature, and he does a good job of it. The movie is also very well cast, with every actor understanding the film's outrageously comic mood and acting accordingly. Supriya Pathak leads the film as the dumb Hansa with a terrific performance that is downright hilarious. Her screen presence is the strongest in the film; when she's on-screen, no one else exists, when she is not, you badly want her to reappear. Rajeev Mehta, Nimisha Vakharia, Jamnadas Majethia and Anang Desai play their roles excellently. What I liked about the film is the fact that it is not an unintentional comedy, it's a well-scripted picture which knows how it wants to work. To sum it up, Khichdi is an outstanding no-brainer and for me it is also quite addictive. I already want to watch it again.\n",

            "Sequels are the shiz right now, but they rarely are as good as the originals as this musical social drama testifies.The rock band Magik do not produce music anymore, but the members are still in touch. Jo (Arjun Rampal) and KD (Purab Kohli) are in Mumbai doing their stuff while Aditya (Farhan Akhtar) is in Meghalaya, away from his family and music in general, trying to introspect about his past life. Following an eventful episode at his place of work in the NE state, Aditya is coaxed by his friends and family to return to Mumbai. It is then that he and others meet Jiah (Shraddha Kapoor), a talented musician with father problems and a horrendous past, the latter of which is back to haunt Magik...While that synopsis above may sound interesting, I can assure you it isn't. The story resumes from where the first film ended. After the death of Rob, Magik continue to create music for a while after which they dismantle, the reason for which is what is explored in the first half. It uses the same formula as the first film wherein there's a past event which troubles Aditya and other members and how the passion for music helps them bounce back. Same old, same old!It is evident that the film was made to bank in on the first film's roaring success. So much that even the sequences are recreated variations; albeit in different contexts, but still the same. In Rock On!! (2008), Aditya's wife is the one who makes the reunion of Magik possible, and here, too, she is seen in her sentimental wifey avatar doing what she does. But, the biggest problem with the film is that it deviates from the musical genre and tries to become a loud social drama. Magik try to use the power of music to help spread a social message and raise funds and all that comes with it. The plot even tries to mix these topics together, but the result is hollow as a dead tree's bark. Throw in a petty villain to this mixture, and you have the perfect recipe, thought the makers.Cast performance is good, but Kapoor looks out of place here, with her snobby air. The characters mostly engage in irritating its audience. And that affects the whole flow of the film and the watching experience.It's basically a sad story which explores one too many topics and fails. It's a lazy attempt with a climax full of clichés and improbable situations. So much problems with this concoction that one might just watch the first film once again and forget they even made a sequel. \"Rock On!!\" was delightfully brilliant: it had romance, comedy, drama, and mostly, good music. This one lacks all of them, unless you consider melodrama as an interesting element.BOTTOM LINE: Shujaat Saudagar's \"Rock On 2\" is a lazy gimmick which was obviously made to make the world know that the makers care about the adverse lives of people in the world. As a musical, this one fails, though. Watch it on TV.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n",

This isn't your average happy family love flick with everyone dancing around huge larger than life sets. This is more of a gritty dark painful film full of anger and betrayal. This original lost and found formula features some of RD burmans finest work ever as a music director. from the title track to \"churalia hai tumnein\" and the fiery \"lekhar hum diwana dil\". all the tracks work brilliantly with the story. The villain in story is just the biggest baddest larger than life villain you just can wait get. Dharmedra plays the role of vengeful man brilliantly. the other two lesser know hero's do a rather fantastic job. Vijay Aurora the dashing young man after sizzling Zeenat Amaan's heart and Tariq the bad ass nightclub singer with the massive 70's shades and shiny flares. Neetu Singh though brilliant in the song \"lekhar hum diwana dil\" does not have much of a role in the film. the heroines in this film are just the hero's love interests and don't do much else. All in all this film is very entertaining and the scene where the brothers re-unite at the night club is enough to bring anyone to tears.

The film has a great script (Aseem Arora, Pratham Jolly and Manu Rishi) which, despite having no pace or action has a great structure, crackling dialogues by Manu Rishi, good production design and sound design, brilliant music score by Sandesh Shandiliya, cinematography by Raj Chakraborty which beautifully captures the tension and humaneness and last but not the least, the compact cast (Vijay Raaz, Manu Rishi, Vishwajeet and Raj Zutshi) which is simply humane and riveting. The problem with the film is that it lacks compactness which was there in the 2002 Academy Award winning Bosnian film 'No Man's Land', whose shades can be seen in the film. Overall, debut director Vijay Raaz's direction added with Gulzar's poetry make the film worth a watch. My rating would be: 4/5\n",

            "To date, I have never seen a film like it. There will never a film like this be made now, as India is becoming increasingly westernized day by day.To prove this point we already have a reality show Bigg Boss copied from Big Brother which was first developed by Endemol in the Netherlands. In this show people can openly express their sexuality and sexual preference. Back to the film. It deals with many topics and in order to appreciate the message of the film, you will need a second viewing. I myself have seen this film at least ten times and each time I have discovered something new that I had missed earlier.The topics dealt with are: national and internal security, prostitution in India, the life of orphans in India, crime and extortion and the influence of the media. It also deals with madness. Major Chauhan who as a child watched his mother abducted was deeply affected mentally and to this day still has visions of that terrible day. Left untreated this madness built in him throughout the years, and when it finally erupted in the climax of the film it was devastating.Also we see in the film that Major Chauhan has a vision for his country - people of all caste and creed freed from all shame, hatred and suspicion and united in mutual love. This is the final scene of the film which is I think removed by the India Censor Board in the TV screening of the film.Major Chauhan is committed to a mental asylum after which we notice a change in his character. He is finally at peace with himself and is waiting with eager anticipation at the final fulfillment of his dream.Plot: Peter D'Souza goes for commando training and is trained by Major Chauhan who takes a liking to him. He completes his training with honors receiving the prized Commando Dagger.During a mission to rescue some schoolchildren taken hostage by terrorists, he is fatally shot in the legs and crippled for life. He is discharged with honors. Major Chauhan gets an wedding invitation from Peter some time later. When he arrives and inquire of Peter's whereabouts, he is told bluntly by a woman that Peter is no more.What happens next has to be seen. I sincerely request you to see this film or better still buy it on DVD or VCD. It will be money well spent.This is the only film directed by Nana Patekar. Why he hasn't directed more films after Prahaar is a mystery.GOD BLESS India.\n",

            "Warning: I have viewed this movie only in Tamil. Telugu and Hindi movie-goers are expected to add a pinch of salt while reading further.This is one of the most hyped-up movies ever in Indian movie history. When people begin to wonder if it can live upto the hype, the movie reveals the calculated gradual publicity built up over the months. In case you haven't watched and read enough on television and the Web, do so immediately to comprehend the movie better.The basic story is nothing new, but the movie delves to a large extent into the dark recesses of the psychopathic mind of Nandu. We get to view the real-plus-imaginary world inhabited by this schizophrenic character \"with paranoid delusions\", courtesy special effects and animation. All this happens even as an engaging action thriller unfolds on the screen. The delusion and flashback portions seem to slow down the pace. Many scenes involving Nandu send a chill down your spine, though the language and violence, at times, seems unfit for children.While the commando operation in the beginning and the relationship between the lead pair remind of you Hollywood movies, the designer clothes worn by the antagonist and sponsor promotion towards the end are true Bollywood 'ishtyle'. What you get is a curious mix of cliches and innovations.Kamal Haasan plays the negative character alternating between style and realism, though things seem to get repetitive. The other character of an NSG major seems much like the real-life Kamal, mouthing anti-religious remarks and sporting a unique lifestyle. Raveena manages to hold her own while Manisha is good despite appearing only in a few scenes. The dubbing for both of them seems odd on a few occasions. Talented actors like Gunaji and Gidwani seem wasted in roles with few scenes and little potential.No stone has been left unturned when it comes to the technical aspects of the movie like art direction, cinematography, editing, sound effects and visual effects; but the computer graphics is found wanting sometimes. Double role picturisation has possibly never been better, even in Hollywood, though those movies rarely employ an actor portraying two roles. The attention to detail is also stunning.The songs blend seamlessly with the movie, beyond expectations -- the title track serves as the background for a chase sequence and still manages to come out good! But this certainly isn't another Dil Chahta Hai for Shankar-Ehsaan Loy. The background score might seem mediocre at places when viewed in the surroundings of other superior elements. Vairamuthu's lyrics and poems bring out the various dimensions of the complex character. Symbolism is built into the script (done by Kamal Haasan himself) much like Hey Ram, reducing the work of the director.To sum it up, this is an interesting masala movie, with exemplary techniques and a lot of sensible elements incorporated into it.\n",

            "'Youngistaan' may not be flawless or a razor-sharp political satire, but its A Well-Made, Honest Film. Its potential cannot be denied, despite its visible minuses!'Youngistaan' Synopsis: Abhimanyu Kaul - a young, independent, Games Developer, living in Japan & the love of his life, Anwita Chauhan - a bubbly, passionate & full of life, summer intern. Their happy and content life faces the test of time, when blood ties & the pressure of being born into the first family of India tears a young Abhimanyu between his love for Anwita & a promise made to his dying father, the Prime Minister of India. Being a public figure, by reluctantly accepting to represent the governing party, much against his own wishes & at the cost of his private life, is a double-edged sword that Abhimanyu must walk on.'Youngistaan' explores an underdog's story with honesty. It begins well, it progresses well, as the humor works, the political portions work & so do the performances. But, the second-hour begins to lose pace. Once our protagonist, turns into the most powerful man of the country, his journey grips you completely. But, the subplot, the romantic-angle, acts as a deterrent, more-so in the second-hour. Its stagnates the pace as well as the overall impact. Another thing, the length could've been trimmed, by at least 15-minutes. Syed Ahmad Afzal's Screenplay does justice to an interesting premise, but could've been sharper. His Direction, on the other-hand, is controlled. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise: Jackky Bhagnani enacts the protagonist, with sincerity. He's controlled, mature & believable all through. This has to be his best work till date. Neha Sharma does an okay job. The Late/Great Farooq Sheikh is a joy to watch, as always. Boman Irani is wasted.On the whole, 'Youngistaan' is a good watch.\n",

            "Something is wrong. Yes, something is terribly wrong. Either there is a problem with me, or there is a problem with the majority of Indian audience. I'm saying this, because I loved this film. Yes, you heard it right, I loved this film which most of you called crap and time waste stuff. When you people can accept the recycled, re-re-re-re-re-used, clichéd, melodramatic Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, why cant you accept this fresh and beautiful Jhootha Hi Sahi?? I still remember, Jaane Tu Yaa Jaane Na was 70% 'Niram' (It's a Malayalam Movie released in 1998, and later remade to Hindi as Tujhe Meri Kasam with Reitesh Deshmukh and Genelia D'zouza). The rest 30% was the Khan brothers comedy, the Photoframe-dad portion, and all. In fact, apart from these two things, the movie was a crap. Then how did it become such a success? The answer is simple, there are big names behind. Aamir Khan, and his nephew Khan making a debut. Then AR Rahman, the Mozart of Madras. And what the makers did is, from the beginning they brought a false sensation of youthness and freshness in the movie, so that all the youth got attracted. It even had a song of heroine being sad because of her cat's death, and hero making her happy. Also, there was a 'Pappu' song, in which Pappu danced quite well, though. Then there was sister-brother-chooha fight, search for a girl, the new girl episode, self realization and mutual understanding, airport singing!! That's all!! I still wonder why this went out to be a big hit!!But, Jhootha Hi Sahi has no Pappu song, there are no FUNNY moments (if you think JTJYN had funny moments), Jhootha Hi Sahi is a honest attempt from a director who badly wants to come out of the clichéd world and do something new and innovative. People had drawn parallels with the 2002 film 'University', I don't know, I haven't watched that film. But, this is a very good film, and I feel pity about the audience and the critics who gave a thumb down to the movie. The movie is fresh, the performances are nice, and it offers at least 3-4 good songs. The song lyrics are penned according to the situations, and the entire movie is shot well. The only drawbacks one can find are Mansi Scott who played John Abraham's girlfriend, she acted well, but didn't look good. Also, the climax of bridge opening and John jumping, etc were usual bollywood stuff. But, apart from that, it is a very good movie.The performances are awesome. While John Abraham shines in his new avatar, the real showstealer is Pakhi Tyrewala, who surprises us with a fine performance, and well written dialogues. Among the other cast, Raghu Ram is awesome!! Also, Alishka Varde and George Young shared very good chemistry. The cameos by Madhavan and Nandana Sen were nice.The music, as I had reviewed earlier, is good. There are good songs in the movie, and they are placed at apt places. Even the song 'Pam para' looked okay on screen, which otherwise I don't like.On the whole, I loved the movie when I watched it. It is very sad thing that such a good movie flopped severely at box office. :(\n",

            "I get very ticked off when Indian filmmakers take a Hollywood movie and give it their own spin and call it their invention. In reality all they have done is added some songs in the midst. The master of Plagarising is Bhatt Camp, I could name all of their movies being copies of Good Hollywood movies. Murder-- Unfaithful, Paap--The witness, Awara Pagal Dewana--The whole Nine Yards, Saaya--Dragonfly, Zeher--Out of Time, I am telling you all of Bhatt's movies can be linked to a Hollywood flick. The funny thing is nobody is catched on to it yet, the movie is a frame to frame copy. After couple initial frames it clicked right away. Zeher is a good remake, usually they screwed it up big time. It just bothers me when people give credit to people who have done nothing but watched a English version on their DVD player. As far as the performances go, Emraan had big shoes to fill considering he was playing Denzel's part, he tries but at times in comparison he does not get the same impact as Denzel. Shamita played her role the best but then she was playing Eva Mendez's part, she is not all that known for acting. Udita looked cute in paap, here she looked awful to me. She didn't impress me as far as her performance was concerned. Ninad Kamat played a good part. If this movie was a hit then I feel bad because the audience has been cheated of their money, just go to a video place and get out of time, 2003. Much better movie with a treat of watching Denzel act. If Indian audiences are filled in theatres for some teaser nonsex scenes, might as well watch Hollywood flicks, they show more, do more, and have hotter chicks. I hate Mahesh Bhatt, He is a thief, i don't mind remaking a film, but don't give yourself credit for writing the story or concept, which he does every single time. Although, I would give Zeher a good score, just because its different than other bollyflicks.\n",

            "Having watched a lot of promos of this movie, I must say that I was not disappointed. A movie by Priyadarshan means that it would have some good comedy side to it and what more when one has Akshaye Khanna and Paresh Rawal.Janardhan Wishvandhar is a widower who seems to have spent his life bringing up two children, Chirag and Gauarav. The latter is the one who decides to take care of his father and looks after him in such a way that at times he has to bail him out of prison for stripping in a Police station with his notorious friend, Madhav, to shouting at him and at times locking him up. Chirag in the meantime is totally henpecked husband. This all goes on until a girl decides to play pranks on Gaurav and Janardhan meets an ex - flame.The movie stars Akshaye Khanna, Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Genelia DeSouza and Rajpal Yadav, Manoj Joshi and Naseerudin Shah in a special appearance and is directed by Priyadarshan.This is perhaps one of the best movies that have been released this year - it has both comedy and emotional drama which at times is rare to find in a movie these days. Akshaye Khanna as usual is good as are Paresh Rawal and Om Puri as well as Genelia DeSouza. A couple of tunes are also decent to listen to (which makes a change) Conclusion: A film well worth watching.\n",

My favourite would be Waheeda Rehman, she was brilliant in OJJ. There is nice music, an average script, an entertaining story, and super cool direction.Om Jai Jagdish may not have been commercially successful, but it is certainly decent cinema.

Shahid Kapoor seems to confuse acting with exposing his teeth and pretending to say a few words. Sharmila Tagore is wasted. Could Sameera Reddy look more uninterested? Ayesha Takia seems to enjoy fluttering her eyelashes. Chunkey Pandey seems to think talking in a cringe-inducing voice is acting. Om Puri is wasted too. Direction is amateurish.

            "1980's was the decade when Hindi cinema had touched an abysmal low. The severe menace of piracy had robbed the sheen out of the films of those times. Due to a shrinkage in market, producers indulged in cost-cutting techniques resulting in substandard productions. Poor picture quality, inferior production-values and cheap disco-numbers took away the glamour quotient of the films. Facing a budgetary constraint, film-makers started focusing more on kitchen-sink dramas to woo the lower middle-class audiences. Even when there was some action, they were way below the 70's standards.But from time-to-time, there were the big-ticket ventures like 'Karma' (1986), 'Mr.India' (1987), 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' (1988), 'Ram Lakkhan' (1989), 'Maine Pyar Kiya'(1989), 'Tridev' (1989), etc which offered some much needed respite from the constant nightmare of mediocrity. One of those films was N.N.Chandra's 'Tezaab'(1988).When I saw the film 2 years back, I wasn't much impressed as I felt the script was quite wayward and overall not good enough. But after being exposed to some more regular 80's fare, I happened to watch this film recently again. And this time I was just blown away!I have realised that I wasn't being fare to this film by judging it solely on the basis of it's script; as compared to the regular 80's fare, this film offered so much more! First of all, this was a big- budget film. From the picture quality, sets and locales to its hard- hitting action, the film was shot on a huge scale. The film has a sort of grandeur which is bound to be a breath of fresh air for cine-goers of those times.But for me, the 3 assets of the film are its dialogues, editing and background music. The dialogues are extremely hard-hitting and create a severe impact. The editing is extremely fast-paced and makes a solid impact from the opening scene itself. In fact it could even compete with any film of the mid-2000 period. On this front, the film was clearly way ahead of its time! And Laxmikant-Pyarelal seem to have given their all in creating a high-voltage background score that turbo-charges the film non-stop for the entire duration. That's not to say, they fared any worse when it came to the songs. 'Kehdo Ki Tum'and 'So Gayi Yeh Zameen' deliver the goods with 'Ek Do Teen' remaining a timeless classic till now!Performance is another strong point for the film. Almost the entire cast comprising of Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher, Kiran Kumar, Annu Kapoor, etc deliver some power-packed performances. But it's Suresh Oberoi who stands out as the righteous and sympathetic cop, who ensures justice is finally delivered at the end. Even Chunky Pandey delivers a surprisingly heart-felt performance which is probably his best act till date. This was one of Johny Lever's earlier films and he is as usual wonderful; especially in the Telugu-mouthing Arabian act! Mandakini appears in a small cameo in what is probably the only poorly etched out character.Many might consider the 'Ek Do Teen' number to be the highlight of the film; but for me the highlight was the demolition sequence of Lotiya Pathan's empire. With explosions, car-crashes, collapsing towers this was one of the most expensive action-sequences back then and clearly takes one's breath away! Even on the 1st occasion when I didn't like the film, I was still blown away by this particular sequence. In fact the sequence is so good, that I expected this to be the grand-climax for the film. But I was quite surprised to see that the film still went on for another half-an-hour. Still after watching a sequence like this, one expected the climactic battle to be even more stunning. But the final confrontation, filmed aboard a ship, simply drags on and falls way below expectations. This leaves a sour taste to an otherwise gripping drama.The title (meaning 'acid') and the tag-line ('A Violent Love-Story') suit the film to the tee. The script might be a bit wayward; but the performances, dialogues, music, production quality, action and above all the editing make it a riveting experience for the viewers. This high-voltage concoction generates a heavy reaction on the viewer's psyche. Although it's nowhere near Anil Kapoor's best works, it's still one of the better films of the 1980's. Overall it's a spicy potboiler that is delicious for the regular Bollywood fans; but could give 'acidity' to those who aren't accustomed to stuffs like these!\n",

Laugh.BAM!Thats the formula Ram Gopal Varma has come up with, for his audience, in this mercilessly shocking movie.0. Boo...A never-scared, self-satisfied, endlessly-laughing man, watches Darna Mana Hai in an empty theatre, hates it to the core and takes a shortcut through a graveyard, against his mother's advice. There...1. The ProfessorA Biotech student visits his professor at his house to clear his doubts before examination. The meeting turns into an annoyance when the professor behaves troubled with something. The student prepares to leave. Then...2. One Call PleaseA man, whose car breaks down, knocks the door of an unusual couple for help. As he gets more comfortable with them and as they display their new unusual hobby, they discover that their meeting was not just a coincidence.3. Life is RiskyAn ambitious Insurance Policy man approaches a middle-class family to impress them with his \"Life is Risky\" tactics. While he is constantly shown only the door, he even goes a step further in completing his target.4. The DirectorA romantic-movie director wants to make a horror movie. On the way to his out-of-city bungalow, where he decides to write the climax, he gives lift to a stranded girl in his car. As she narrates her story, his job becomes easier than he had imagined.5. Ma...A young man who saves a girl from running over by his car on a rainy night, wakes up to find himself in a lock-up, accused for a crime which he has never committed. As a stranger visits him in the station, the truth that unfolds then, seems stranger than fiction.6. Twinkle Twinkle Little StarSix brave children, misusing their school picnic freedom, hike in a forest and arrive at a haunted house where they meet an old lady who lives alone without fear. As they get friendly with each other, she challenges to scare them by narrating six frightening stories. While she stops after the fifth, the bravest kid asks her, \"Where is the sixth one, Dadi Ma?\". He will be told.It would take too long to review each story. Therefore, I'd like to put it in a brief way. Each story has its own theme and its own shock value, though, a few similarities can be felt between The Couple and The Director (in both one tries to fool another with a scare) and also between The Director and Ma (the car, dark road, rain). Nevertheless, the rest are unique among them.\"Life is Risky\" devastates a common man's sense of self-security. It jolts but doesn't scare. Rajpal Yadav is greaaaatttt as the Insurance man. Sunil and Sonali just fit in the role. \"The Director\" is beautifully made. When Mallika narrates her story in dark, it somehow reminded me of the song \"Ye Sard\" from RGV's Bhoot. I expected more but unfortunately it ended too soon and made me feel \"Is that all?\". Anil Kapoor and Mallika have done whats necessary. Nothing more. \"The Couple\" is slow, sensuous, playful, scary and predictable. You just cant forget that smile! Makrand shines in his role. Arjun and Bipasha have done a good job. \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" is the movie's central story. Ava Mukherji is, in one word, scary! The children have dutifully performed as they have been instructed.Now the three best episodes. \"Ma...\" is a brilliant tale. Randeep is wow! Zakir is unbelievably superb. Rasika excels in her role. Are you going to Poona? In car? In the night? In rain? Beware! \"Boo...\" is the Prologue. Manoj Pahwa. Man! What a carelessly cool actor! His mother is a good diversion. She has done well too. Sorry. I wont say anything more than this.Of all the seven stories, \"The Professor\" steals the show. Amitabh! The icon of Bollywood gives one more earth shattering performance! How many more styles does he have! This episode stops you, shocks you and gives you shivers, cos you don't know whats in it and whats gonna come next. Ritesh has rendered a befitting performance. He seems more scared of Amitabh's acting skills than the scenario he is in. Cos the old man rules!This movie on the whole has more fear and shock value than Darna Mana Hai, although I should accept that except for \"The Professor\", DMH had much better story plots. In my opinion, the most shocking of all the 14 stories in both DMH and DZH is \"The Professor\" and the scariest of all is \"The Teacher\" from Darna Mana Hai. Overall, DMH didn't scare as much as DZH, but it made us squirm and feel creepy cos of the reality which the stories reflected. It left a long lasting impression in us. On the other hand, the shocks that DZH has in store, will hit you hard and cruel with sudden force, only when you naively think that its time to relax. Thats merciless! It shocks you. It keeps you excited. It makes you giggle with fear. And its fun. Its a different experience on the whole. Feel sorry for yourself, if you miss this great movie. And feel more sorry while watching it...Hey! Look who is behind you!\n",

As always in a Ram Gopal Varma movie, the camera work and the background score are exceptionally good. The movie has nothing new to offer but some fine performances by Mr. Bachchan and Amit Sadh make up for the slow pace. Manoj Bajpai is impressive as Govind while Bajrangbali Singh who plays Gandhi is a great find. Yami Gautam holds on to the same 'horrifying' expression throughout the movie.

The names are the same, but the plots are completely different. This IMDb entry is incorrect. It contains the plot summary and cast information for the 1981 film, but the profile poster in this entry is for the 2003 film. Both are great films, but someone who is not as familiar with Hindi film names is going to be very confused. I am entering a plot summary for the 2003 film, puctured in the profile poster and my rating of 7 is also for that film. Two best friends named Tara and Sitara(Govinda and Sanjay Dutt), who consider themselves brothers, are fairly successful con men and burglars who end up at odds with a much more sinister crime duo called Cobra and Panther. Tara and Sitara go into hiding, managing to talk their way into staying at the guest house of a high-ranking Army officer named Ram Singh who is looking for the sinister crime duo. They do this by pretending to be former owners of the home who now are homeless, Tara faking paralysis in a wheelchair. Ram Singh also just happens to have a daughter and a younger sister who take a liking to Tara and Sitara and romance ensues. In the meantime, will Cobra and Panther find Tara and Sitara and wreak vengeance? This really is a very funny film and Dutt (who often plays a scary gangster type like in Vaastav:The Reality) is the perfect comic foil for the hilarious Govinda.

Take a bow, Shonali Bose!Some films are more than just cinematic expressions and The Sky Is Pink is one such film where director Shonali Bose has worked herself to the grind & her presence is felt in every frame. Her devotion and dedication towards her craft is truly inspirational. The Sky Is Pink is special in more ways than one. In my individualistic opinion, it easily ranks amongst this year best works so far. Just don't miss this one!Clearly, the writing (Shonali Bose & Nilesh Maniyar) is smart, taut and absorbing. Kudos! The emotions in The Sky Is Pink would've fallen flat had the writing been sub-standard or the execution of the material been humdrum or the actors been inferior. But, thankfully, it scores in all three departments. All said and done, it's an outstanding film!The story is complex but The Sky Is Pink is *not* disheartening or unsettling. The emotional quotient is tremendous. You'll overhear a lot of sniffs & see a lot of moist eyes once the lights are switched on. But it's a positive film & not a rona-dhona movie. Irrespective of how this film performs at the box-office, but note this, director Shonali Bose would be a force to reckon with after The Sky Is Pink. Pritam's music is soothing. Nick Cooke & Kartik Vijay's cinematography is incredible. The very effective and subtle background score (Mikey McCleary1) is The Sky Is Pink's very backbone. For the very first time, I felt that I was not hearing the background score, I was feeling it. Dialogue (Juhi Chaturvedi & Nilesh Maniyar) will touch your soul.Now to the performances! Farhan Akhtar & Priyanka Chopra make the characters so plausible. It must be said that Farhan Akhtar & Priyanka Chopra exude a certain dignity and elegance, much needed for a sensitive film of this magnitude & caliber. Kudos to them! That doesn't mean that the remaining performances get dwarfed. Not once does Zaira Wasim dither from her position. This is the hallmark of a tremendous actor, which Zaira Wasim is. Rohit Saraf is a revelation, another surprise of The Sky Is Pink. Amazing!Manas Mittal's editing is so well synchronized that the 2+ hours of your precious life that you would spend on this movie are absolutely worth your while. On the whole, The Sky Is Pink is an amazing experience. Should win awards & also box-office rewards. It should strike a chord with everyone with a heart. An unmissable film which encapsulates the true essence of life & death & seduces the viewer with a strong emotional quotient.\n",

Mamta looks sexy, Agnihotri looks the part of her doe-eyed lover, Paresh Rawal stretches his acting abilities and Danny is... well, the villain. Dimple is great as usual, but the real item here is Nana, who blazes across the screen (he got a Best Actor award for this), mesmerizing the viewer. Take him out, and this is yet another Indian potboiler about politics, crime, romance and bloodshed.Long after u forget the rest of the film, u will still remember all the scenes related to Nana. In fact, the director could have made the film more focused and gripping by taking out all the silly songs and sub-plots (even though i'm a bit partial to sexy rain songs featuring starlets like Mamta, they do seem to be out of place here). Like Pacino and De Niro, Nana Patekar's acting leaves u breathless and begging for more. If u r a fan of his, this is not to be missed. If u haven't seen any of his flicks yet, this is a FINE place to get started.Rating: 8/10\n",

On the next scene, we saw that Preeti was hated by her own father. As the curiosity of the audience started to increase, the story unfolds itself when the film showed flashback for the audience to know the real story of Preeti and Avinash. Both have a dark secret that they tried to hide.The story coped about the stigma in India on rape victims. It was clearly illustrated in the film that a rape victim will be shunned by her own family and society. She would be doomed to be unmarried for life since her father would be ashamed to consider her as 'perished goods'.

            "In the current techno times, the easiest way to know how long a movie has been into its making is to simply look at the mobile phones being used in its scenes. The various models in the hands of the characters would clearly give you the idea of how old the product actually is. And that's exactly the case with \"Milenge Milenge\", which was scheduled to be released a long time back. Moreover the jaded looks of its lead pair also tell the long tough story behind the scenes.But that was not news to the general public since its promos and music clearly revealed its real production status. The actual and sad news is that the movie is entirely a devoted inspired version of the John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale starrer English romantic flick \"Serendipity\" released in 2001 and has got nothing in original as such added by its director Satish Kaushik.Admittedly, I already knew that its story was based on the English Hit but I really didn't expect it to be such a straight lift or copy from the original source. Though it starts with the same clichéd college and youth festival sequences, where the boy and girl meet to fall in love. But after its initial hour the movie simply starts following \"Serendipity\" blindly. Every single scene post intermission is precisely copied from the English movie as it is. In fact even the side characters, sequences and added comic scenes are also there exactly in the same manner as in \"Serendipity\".For instance, as seen in its original, the heroine here too believes in destiny and wants to test it in order to find her true love. The use of Currency note and a book to write the names and address of each other by the couple are straight away copied. Further the lift sequence, the shopping bag element, the credit card receipt, the greedy seller at the store, the address hunt in the godown, the two moving to another city to find each other and the last moment marriages of both the lead characters are all adapted just like that.Funnily there is a small sequence in the Original, where the heroine's friend screams looking at a duplicate PRADA purse being sold on the road side at a cheap price. Even after being told about the wrong spellings of PRADA on it, she still feels excited to buy it. Now this scene is no- where relevant to the script and is added only for having some fun moments. But even this scene gets copied in \"Milenge Milenge\" blindly where only the brand name changes from \"PRADA\" to \"GUCCI\" very creatively. What a true inspiration indeed!Hence, it once again becomes very difficult for me to write about a creative product which is not original from any angle in the first place. Satish Kaushik has earlier given a massive hit in the past as \"Tere Naam\". So from a director of his stature a straight and clear lift from another source without any courtesy was really not expected. His direction may be fine for the people who don't care at all that he has borrowed. But personally I was quite taken back by this kind of an unofficial version project being associated with the name of Satish Kaushik.The acting of both Shahid and Kareena is just OK considering the actual time span of the movie in which it was shot. But Shahid supporting the chain smoking act, should have been strictly avoided. It was really not needed, even if the film was released a few years before. In the supporting cast, everyone plays his or her role like a routine but Satish Shah, Kiron Kher and Aarti Chhabria were completely wasted in their small acts. However Satish Kaushik himself shines in his short cameo. Musically, Himesh Reshamiya's score is just fine with nothing exceptional.Now why I am in a hurry to finish up the review? That's because I am least interested about writing about some finer details of a movie which is entirely lifted from anyone else's creative efforts. Inspiration can be accepted but exactly similar sequencesare really not what the young Indian audience is looking for. May be the makers have their own truthful arguments over the inspiration issue but if you ask me, there can never be any justified clarification for such an act in the creative world. Yet, I can only wish that it is an undisclosed official version of its original.\n",

            "\"Well Done Abba\", the latest offering from Shyam Benegal is strictly made on the similar lines of his previous \"Welcome to Sajjanpur\", but tries to tackle too many important issues in only one project. With a feeble basic story line, the movie tries to convey almost all the major problems faced by the rural areas still fighting for their existence in an otherwise developed country. It majorly talks about a less educated village person who wishes to have his own well in front of his house as per the New Government Policy of that region. The viewer is made familiar with all the protocol problems he has to face while interacting with the government officials for getting the job done. Along with that the director tries to showcase several sensitive issues such as human labour, illiteracy, girl education in villages, selling of young girls to Sheikhs, status of women in Indian rural politics, corruption in Public Distribution System and many more in a single movie which at times seems to be over lengthy and un-required at places.The long duration of the movie, its slow pace and the consistent Hyderabadi lingo used throughout the movie are the other few things which go against the movie and reduce its chances to win over the common man entering the theater purely for his entertainment.But for lovers of off-beat subjects and fans of Shyam Benegal kind of cinema, \"Well Done Abba\" is another soft gem from the master film-maker with an important message for the society. Interestingly, the movie starts very slowly and keeps on growing on the viewers mind at its own pace. You need to have patience to sit through its first half as it's only towards the intermission and post interval that you get more engrossed into the subject and start enjoying it with a more realistic feel. However there are certain sequences which go over the top like writing a report against a lost well, a police officer with no major case to work on, an over sexual government official and a marriage song coming just before the movie ends. Some of these sequences should have been easily edited out in order to give a more crispier product to the viewers, because ideally a project based on rural settings with a social message should only be around 2 hours of duration to leave an impact.Apart from these few hic-ups, \"Well Done Abba\" has some great performance worth watching. The best act comes from Boman Irani, as Abba who is simply superb in his very subtle portrayal of the character. Never in the movie, he reacts in anger to the tough situations faced in the government offices. On the contrary his innocent responses towards the corrupt officials happen to be the main highlight of the movie. For instance, just look out Boman's reaction in the climax, when he comes to know that the boy he has chosen for his girl is an orphan without any religion. Moreover, Boman performs a double role in the movie of two real brothers with great conviction. It's really commendable for a person to achieve such heights in a profession which he opted for only after the age of 40. Unarguably it's one of the finest performance of Boman till date.Minnisha Lamba is another surprise package of the movie. She completely transforms herself into her on screen character and excels. Out of the rest, Samir Dattani, Ravi Kishen and Rajendra Gupta have performed excellently. But I really felt that the Ravi Kishen plot of the movie should have been treated more gracefully on the screen. Shantanu Moitra's musical score is fine but strangely there is very minimum use of Indian instruments in the songs set in the rural areas, particularly the marriage song towards the end.Adapted from three different sources, \"Narsaiyyan Ki Bavdi' by Jeelani Bano, \"Phulwa Ka Pul\" by Sanjeev and \"Still Waters\" by Jayant Kriplani, \"Well Done Abba\" has surely got the much acclaimed Benegal kind of treatment all over. It also reminds you of the famous T.V. serial \"Office Office\" in which Pankaj Kapoor played a similar kind of character quite close to that of \"Abba\". Regarding the star-cast of the movie, I was really surprised by the minuscule roles given to the two favourite actors of the director in the industry. Using almost the same team of actors since his \"Suraj Ka Satwan Ghoda\", this time the director gives very less importance to both Ila Arun and Rajit Kapoor who have been part of the director's every major product since the 90s. Along with them, another talented actress, Sonali Kulkarni is also simply wasted in a silly kind of role of a newly married lady.In the end, I would surely like to add that \"Well Done Abba\" is apparently not everyone's cup of tea. But you may start liking the taste, if you keep sipping the tea with patience. And for all of the readers who haven't seen the other world famous gems of the master film-maker This is not one of Benegal's finest works, as he is on the path of trying new styles of story-telling with the changing times. So don't form any opinion about him by just watching some of his recent works.Shyam Benegal has got loads of text book material on film-making stuffed in his rich movies repertoire of the past. Hence start exploring NOW!\n",

            "I watched this film many times as a kid, and it always kept me on the edge of my seat. This of course is not an example of great filmmaking or storytelling, but it still works as a masala flick, and is actually quite slick for a movie of its sort. The action scenes are typical for the times but are quite fun to watch. There are three heroes in this film, and all three are very good: Jackie Shroff doing the nonchalant guy in search of himself, Sunny Deol playing the angry-young-man, while obviously Naseeruddhin Shah steals the show in a ceaselessly amusing role, which he plays with a great deal of humour and seems to have no qualms about ridiculing himself. Then there are the three hot ladies - the pretty Sonam, the impossibly stunning Madhuri Dixit, while actually it is the beautiful Sangeeta Bijlani who gets the meatiest part in what is possibly her best role, and does the most of it in addition to having a very nice chemistry with Shroff. And there's the music, and what an amazing soundtrack it is. Each song is a gem and holds such great nostalgic value for me. \"Tirchi Topiwale\" and \"Main Teri Mohabbat Main\" are great numbers, but it is \"Gali Gali\" which is one of my all-time favourite songs. A true gem of a song - soulful, melodious, and wonderfully written, composed and arranged with a rare touch of psychedelia. This number was one of the first that shot the phenomenal Alka Yagnik to fame, and her rendition is flawless. Other than that, Tridev works as a nice thriller which should not be taken too seriously but enjoyed, and there's plenty to enjoy here.\n",

            "This was the last Khiladi of Akki after the last two disaster Khiladi's. The movie tries to be a thriller but ends up as a badly made thriller. The story is all about crime, death, action, gangsters, and debt. Akki is hired by Alok and he gets married to Alok's daughter ad Alok dies in murder. After this, Akki solves all the problems dispit being a negative character and there are many twists. Akki does good in his negative role but overacts frequently. Mamta just shouts and annoys with her done to death arguments with Akki. The villains are all annoying and basically typecast. The direction is okay at times but very rough mostly. The script is good but the direction and acting ruins it. Akki was considered a bad actor in the late 90's but after Janwaar and Sangharsh, he made his back to back hits comback. These kind of movies ruined him and his career. The movie is another disaster in the 2000 and another typical Hindi movie. Overall, another movie that was a disaster from the early 20's.\n",

            "Revathy's 'Phir Milenge' is a film about a young woman who tragically finds out that she is an HIV positive, a result of a one-time affair she had had with an old friend a few months before. Now she has to cope with the cruel society and its prejudice. This young woman is played by Shilpa Shetty, an actress who sadly never was flooded with great film offers before, but here was given a splendid chance to showcase her talent in a role that was not only one of her best, but one of the best of the year. This film, inspired by the American picture Philadelphia, is made by Revathy in her own different and convincing style. India is not America, and the prejudice can go to any extents in there. Some may say it goes over the top with a stereotyped depiction of prejudice. But if we have to be honest, we got to admit that it's the real situation, not only in India but in all over the world, caused by the ongoing lack of awareness of AIDS and of what it actually is.I found the film realistic, intense, powerful and emotionally touching. But one aspect that impressed me the most was Shilpa Shetty's magnificent dramatic performance. Her heartfelt, sensitive portrayal of the optimistic, stubborn and strong career woman Tamanna Sahni was both heartbreaking and inspiring. She was natural, moving and believable all through, performing the most difficult emotional moments with amazing depth and conviction. Abhishek Bachchan and Salman Khan provide great support. Bachchan is particularly impressive as the simple, humorous lawyer who supports Tamanna throughout the film. Towards the end, the film includes several scenes, some of which are heart-warming, and others are simply heart-rending. The first is Shilpa and Salman's first meeting when he is already at the advanced stages of his illness, when the two start crying as he asks her to forgive him. The following scene of Shilpa's breakdown when she visits Abhishek, is even more powerful, showing Shetty's acting at its deepest expressive level. Phir Milenge is a wonderful dramatic feature which shows us how unexpected life can be. Despite a somewhat slow and dark development, the film remains steadily interesting and compelling and ultimately leaves a mark. I highly recommend.\n",

            "An almost full theater for 1920 EVIL RETURNS in a multiplex on the first day itself (also a holiday) clearly proved that there are still enough fans of horror genre, desperately waiting for a good Hindi horror film from long. But unfortunately once again they all are served the same mediocre stuff from the house of Vikram Bhatt, which has got nothing exceptional as associated with the brand of 1920. May be the result is such since this time the unrelated sequel is not directed by Vikram but by the debutant Bhushan Patel, who mainly falters in the opportunity given due to a poor and unconvincing writing.So even when the film gives you some well executed scenes depicting the possessing spirit, it overall fails to impress because of an all predictable, soul-less storyline penned by Vikram Bhatt himself along with Amin Hajee. As a result, 1920 Evil Returns just remains a quick sequel, purely made to en-cash the brand value of both Vikram Bhatt's Horror Cinema and 1920 in this festive season and nothing else. It begins on a confusing note and then continues its uninteresting run till the interval without moving any further as far as the plot is concerned. And then in the second half too it rarely manages to scare you off in its prolonged climax shot well. At times, the scary sequences even turn out to be funny instead of frightening when the ghost starts singing songs and keeps laughing weirdly.With the actual twist in the script unfolding only in its last 40 minutes, the film relies mostly on repetition and unwanted songs which ideally should be strictly avoided in this particular genre. But as per the routine, the director keeps throwing one love song after another at regular intervals into the film and ruins an otherwise decent soundtrack by Chirantan Bhatt including few fine tracks such as \"Uska Hi Banana\", \"Apna Mujhe Tu Laga\" & more. Apart from the soundtrack the film also has a fine Cinematography which again gets overshadowed by a loud and annoying background score which sounds the same as Vikram's earlier movies.Moreover 1920 EVIL RETURNS remains a hushed-up project in its performance department too as no particular actor is able to contribute in the film through his acting skill other than Tia playing the lead role of a possessed girl. Both Aftab and Sharad Kelkar fail to impress mainly due to the lackluster roles given to them and Vidya Malvade simply stands wasted. Further the viewer is not able to find any emotional connect with the sufferers on the screen because of a feeble screenplay which neither establishes Love or Fear in its 2 hours of duration.To put it together, after watching 1920 EVIL RETURNS you can easily add the name of Vikram Bhatt in the list of those famous film-makers who have now found a new style of making films on a fixed Template or Pattern. In clear words, after Madhur Bhandarkarand Parkash Jha, here is Vikram Bhatt with his new horror film made on a preset template to win over the audience. Now whether you want to be fooled again or not, the choice is all yours.\n",

            "The experience of watching AKAASH VANI gave me enough to think or write upon after a long time since BOL (2011). Though the film is not a masterpiece if you analyze it in cinematic terms, but on the basis of its subject and execution it strongly makes you question our own Indian social structure and WE The People accepting it blindly to maintain our so called social image in front of the others.The Review Promoted as a pure romantic film with a commercial angle, AV starts off well on a lighter note with the girl Nusrat (Vaani) impressing you right away more than the boy Kartik (Akaash). The word love is written on the screen from its first frame itself and their entertaining, likable romance draws you in till the intermission. Director Luv Ranjankeeps it realistic as seen in his PYAR KA PUNCHNAMA and that's the reason why the love story wins over the viewer reminding them of all those soft romantic films before the 90s. But the story doesn't progress much in the first half and the twist is just revealed before the intermission.In the second half, it surprises you with something very important & relevant, revealing an ugly truth of our society dealing with Arranged Marriage, Love Marriage and Marital Rape. Despite of its slow progression and few dragging moments the narration doesn't lose its grip mainly due to the brilliantly written dialogues by the director Luv himself and some splendid performances by the entire cast. For instance, you can easily feel the pain when Vaani says to Akaash, \"Yahan Jab Tak Shareer Par Nishaan Na Ho., Koi Maanta Nahin Hai!\" or when she calmly answers her father that, \"Aapke Kaaran Mujhe Kya Kya Sehna Parha Hai, Woh Main Aapko Bata Bhi Nahin Sakti\" Further the tense moments in this better half are handled well by the cinematographer too which forces you to give your full attention to what the characters are willing to portray, keeping the interest alive throughout.However watching a marital rape on the screen is not anything usual or amusing and thus the team surely deserves all the praises to bring up this hidden truth in a Hindi Film in such a subtle manner, which has been rarely done by others in the 100 years of Indian Cinema. In fact in the recent times I remember a film called MITTAL VS MITTAL(2010) taking up this issue as a cheap sexual gimmick to sell itself in the market and then another classic made on a related issue called MATRUBHUMI (2005) which also is a not to be missed gem without any doubt.The shocking drama in the script gets its full support from the performers and it's a Nusrat's film all the way wherein the girl even reminded me of veterans such as Madhuri Dixit in her difficult scenes of emotional pain and outburst. Kartik supports her well with confidence but the subject basically revolves around Nusrat's life and the trauma she is forced into by her own family. Along with the cute lead pair the director has very carefully chosen his supporting cast in which everyone has lived his or her role impressively especially the actors playing the couple's friends. So we have a great emotional & important film here conceived and performed well following a decent vision.As an essential requirement of a sensible love story, AV also has a fabulous soundtrack featuring 4 great songs with highly poetic & meaningful lyrics penned by the director Luv Ranjan himself again. Both the tracks and background score have been composed & arranged intelligently by Hitesk Sonik and I really wish the soundtrack was promoted more by the makers to reach their real listeners. The 4 worth listening songs are Ittefaq Tha Ek Mazaak Tha, Roomani, Bas Main Aur Tu and Tere Pyar Mein which have great lyrics reminding you of the famous GULZARISM loved and appreciated widely. For instance sample these few lines from one of its great songs,\"Soch Kar Main Jisko Hass Leta Hun, Ittefaaq Tha....., Ek Mazaaq Tha....., Tere Mera Naam! Tere Hi Pher Mein..Boodhe Ek Pedh Pe, Kuchh Lakeerein Kheench Di Thi Do Din Bhi Na Rahey Un Kharonchon Ke Nishan.......! Ittefaaq Tha....., Ek Mazaaq Tha....., Tere Mera Naam!Hence with a fresh breezy first half and an intense thought provoking second one AKAASH VANI can easily be called an important & well made project by the multi talented Luv Ranjan who undoubtedly has got the vision to give us something different and valuable. The film needs to be shown to every youngster above 18 as a mandatory clause and then a Q & A session should be held in colleges taking up the 3 issues discussed ahead in the other section of this article. On a concluding note, we definitely need more films like this as our wake-up call and the youngsters need to watch it in the theater to encourage its visionary makers.\n",

She is a cute two year old girl, who wakes up on the day after her second birthday next to her mother, unable to comprehend why she wouldn't wake up. She soon realises that she is all alone, her father is away and the mother is in deep slumber. Pihu is hungry, bored and hopelessly lonely.It's a social thriller that sends chills down the spine and fills you with compassion for the hapless child who bolts from one near disaster to another without supervision. It's a strong lesson for parents that may have failed to grow the maturity needed to handle young children - their actions may have grave consequences. Pihu is the only live character in the film and she steals your heart - it's not acting as it's not possible for her to be directed. Bravo Vinod Kapri for the sensitive and tactful handling of Pihu. Go for the innovative subject with an utterly believable plotline. 8 STARS!\n",

Ek Paheli Leela made some space in the promos by its entertaining and really good songs, but still on the expectations it didn't had much fate. But Bobby Khan as a director did a really good job and made Leela a Surprisingly Good Movie. Really Entertaining, I must say. Its a good pace movie with its own thrills, which should be credited to the writers. They have written a great, interesting, and a twisting climax. Seeing two faces after a long time was great, Mohit Alahwat and Jas Arora after such a long gap. And thumbs-up to Jas Arora for his performance as Bikram Singh, when you have considered to be as chocolate boy in raster years. Sunny has again done a hard working job to improve herself as an actress, and praise her for that. The most beautiful highlight of the movie is the Cinematography and Choreography of the songs. Hats-off to the person who is behind the camera. Specially frames in the desert are really great.

Even more so to someone who's been a 70s or 80s child. And really really very much to someone who's into trivia. And lastly to anyone who's been a young man in this country, wondering how to get the girls :) That being said, I'll list out some of the things that I loved about the movie --- 1) Look and feel: The movie has been shot remarkably well. The credits, the sets, the production.. it's all classy. Very nicely done. 2) The 80s feels: I do not know what the India of the 80s was like, but I was struck by how nicely they've tried to live true to the movie's setting. There were certainly things that I could relate to, having seen small town India in the 90s :) 3) Narrative, Editing & Direction: I cannot recall a single dull moment in the movie.

            "'Aiyyaa' is a film that redefines zany, whacky, and crazy, or should I instead say 'Wakra'? It's leading lady – a librarian in an Art College in real, and a Bollywood Diva in her fantasies - Meenakshi (played uninhibitedly by Rani Mukherjee) and her acute sense of smell and by connection, unfathomable attraction to the tall, dark, and handsome art student Surya (a delightful Bollywood debut by Malyalam star Prithviraj Sukumaran) and maddeningly Bollywood fantasies drive not only her, but also those around oscillating between sanity and the puerile.Be it her motor mouth mother who keeps laughing and telling all and sundry about how perfect a bride her daughter will be, her father, surrounded by innumerable mostly dysfunctional telephones who has the quirky habit of smoking 4 cigarettes at the same time, her jobless class 10 failed brother 'Nanu' who loves dogs and is dogged in his hate for humanity, or last but not the least, her blind grandmother with her golden dentures who keeps zipping around the house in a motorized wheelchair and passes expert comments on everything.Add to that a crazy co-worker 'Mayna' who is a cross between Lady Gaga and Bugs Bunny. Be it her crazy Lady Gaga inspired dressing, bad Bollywood dancing, maddening fondness for John Abraham, or overall behavior with those around her. She really is as whacky, if not more than Meenakshi's family.The only sane person in her life is her forced fiancé – Madhav Rajadhyaksha (played aptly by Marathi actor Subodh Bhave) whose logicality almost threatens to overpower the smelly attraction Meenakshi has for Surya. And therein lies a terrible tale.This is a classic example of too many ingredients confusing the cook. For, while several sequences stand out for their whacky quotient, the overall picture is one of incoherence. The story and plot are as weak as Meenakshi's knees every time she spots Surya. The funny lines, superb acting, excellent choreography, and beautiful music are somehow thrust at the background every time you desperately hope and wish to hear the mostly silent Surya speak. His body however speaks, rather screams, every time he enters a fantastical dream of Meenakshi and ends up displaying some groovy dancing, a chiseled body complimented by a shaved chest, and six pack abs that stand out in stark contrast to his unkempt chest hair ravaged painter avatar in the real portions. But for the most part your heart might actually go out to the more earthy suitor of Meenakshi with his love for the kind of romance exemplified by Farroukh Sheikh and Deepti Naval.If you shirk your nose every time you catch a rerun of MTV Fully Faltoo, this film might be the smelliest thing to have entered your nostrils. If a great story and plot are those that drive you, this film is likely to be a huge let down. But if you are one of those who are ready for some zany humor, this indeed might be the film to catch. Though a better script/story/plot rounded with some crisp editing would have done this film a world of good, it stills holds its ground for several reasons. Watch it for its characters, presentation, dialogues and crazy sense of humor (thanks to National Award winning director Sachin Kundalkar), whacky lyrics (Amitabh Bhattacharya), fantastic music (Amit Trivedi), exuberant choreography (Vaibhavi Merchant) and last but not the least, for Rani Mukherjee.Be it her enacting of iconic songs and dialogues of Sridevi, Madhuri, or Juhi, her attempts at learning Tamil, her overpowering melodrama about everything happening to her, and for her trio of terrific dance performances - a luscious Lavani, a Silk Smitha inspired 'Dreamup Wakeupum', or her fantastic Kamasutra inspired Belly Dancing in 'Aaga Bai'. Rani is fantastic or should be say 'Wakra'? Go decide for yourself.\n",

            "This is the story of former Headmaster B.V Pradhan and his wife, Parvati, an elderly Bombay couple who are still mourning the death of their only son, who was murdered in a mugging incident in New York. Their grief is immense, and each one of them deals with this tragedy differently. While the husband finds no hope in life and cannot see himself dealing with this situation, the wife does not lose faith in God and is convinced that her son will be reborn soon as suggested by a respected pandit. The couple, quite short of money, decide to rent their late son's room to a paying guest named Sujata, a budding actress who is having an affair with Vilas, the son of an influential politician. Life changes afterwards for the old couple. When Sujata finds out she is pregnant, Parvati considers it as the answer to her prayers, thinking that the child Sujata carries is the reincarnation of her son. But Vilas refuses to take responsibility, while the headmaster and Parvati decide to support Sujata no matter what. When Vilas' father gets to know about this, their life turns into one big nightmare. That's when the film turns from a drama into a semi-thriller.Saaransh is an interesting watch, and is definitely one of Mahesh Bhatt's finest works. It is poignant, involving and moving. The script is very genuinely written, and the execution is quite well done, albeit a bit exaggerated at times. Bhatt presents Bombay as a very dark city of corruption, danger and violence, where life can be really miserable for the elderly and the poor. Old people are shown to be given no respect, and the police is presented as corrupted and careless. But this very depiction actually helped to highlight the courage of this old couple to face them all and stand for what they believe. The film worked more as a drama rather than a thriller. The suspense did work, but the film's main theme, which is the pain of losing your child was much more powerful. One could really feel their pain and understand the headmaster's despair and attempts at suicide, as well as Parvati's fervent and self-convincing beliefs. The film is full of touching moments, all of which are very easy to relate to. That's all due to the well-written dialogues, the simple sets, the limited number of songs which too play only over montage sequences, and of course the lack of overdone melodrama.The portrayal of BV and Parvati's relationship is heartwarming. They are there for each other, and that's what gives them the strength to struggle and go on despite the pain. These two remarkable elderly characters are played by Anupam Kher and Rohini Hattangadi, who ironically had not even reached their thirties at the time. People unaware of their real age could easily think their real age is as presented in the movie, and this explains why they were often typecast in such roles in mainstream Hindi cinema afterwards. This is actually Anupam Kher's first film, and his performance easily ranks amongst his best. He is phenomenal in this role, getting everything about his character absolutely spot on, whether it's his expressions, his body language or his emotional outbursts. Hattangadi is marvelous as Parvati, the optimistic, decisive and supportive wife, who finds solace in her beliefs and prefers living in her own bubble rather than accept reality as it is. Sony Razdan is too well cast and does an excellent job as Sujata.Saaransh is a great emotional drama. The film's ending is, as in most of Bhatt's films of those times, fantastic. It makes one understand that life is to be cherished, even in the most dire of circumstances.\n",

            "1st watched 10/14/2001 - 8 out of 10(Dir-V. Shantaram): Very interesting story about a reformer who takes six murderers out of jail to try and prove that they could function working their own fields and taking care of their own farm despite their evil pasts. Filled with up-tempo musical numbers despite it's very serious story make for a varied movie experience. The basic theme here is forgiveness over and over again and how the kindness displayed to them eventually changes them but not without many trials. These trials make up the rest of the movie and fill in where the musical numbers are not there. I would have liked to see the English subtitles in place during the music just so I could understand instead of guessing what they were singing about but this isn't the fault of the movie just those who distributed it to English speaking audiences. If there is a copy with this added I'll watch the movie again and enjoy it that much more.  But even without this, this is a movie that should not be missed by those who wish to expand their movie-viewing horizons to other countries that are not seen often in the movie world.\n",

            "I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there. Two words of advice to HR - give up acting and secondly, use chapstick.HR has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vamp crap. You can package the product as much as you want, but if there's no substance it won't hold. Don't waste your money...\n",

            "Unlike Bond and other detective movies, Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.\n",

            "Modern Bollywood horror films tend to unintentionally induce humor, and this fourth installment in the popular Raaz franchise is no different.Shaina (Kriti Kharbanda) and her husband Rehaan (Gaurav Arora) have just moved to Romania, the birth place of Count Dracula. While Shaina is hoping to start a family here, Rehaan is preoccupied with something, which the audience have to assume to be what the title suggests (a secret). He behaves like he has ants in his pants and refuses to help her with her mission despite of it being a tempting one. As one can predict, it doesn't take much time for Shaina to experience ghost- like occurrences in the mansion that they live in, and before soon, she is possessed with a so-called spirit. Rehaan regrets his recent rude behavior with his wife, and scrambles to make her sane again, with the help of psychometric, the only new and interesting topic in the whole film.I will say this straight out: there's nothing new in the film, which we could have easily guessed, given that the title suggests pretty much everything it had in store for us. Life of a seemingly happy couple turns upside down when one of them gets possessed whereas the unaffected one tries to pull some strings and chants \"Hail Mary!\" along with that weirdo of an exorcist to make the person sane again. Typical story-line straight out of the horror genre shelf, with some tweaks here and there in dribs and drabs. Emraan Hashmi comes out of a possible fugue state and enters the scene halfway and convolutes the plot just so people could distinguish between the films in the franchise in future. Otherwise, no one would be able to tell the four films apart from each other, save the mercy of the non-recurring actors.There are lots of problems (or errors, as I like to call them here) with the plot and the way the characters speak with each other. Of course, the CBFC was right when it accused the film of using f-words non-sparingly. The ghost in the film seems to be a real performer, providing glimpses of her repertoire while she is in the act of scaring other characters. Her diction is pretty narrow and words obviously hated by CBFC takes up half of it. The fact that the plot unfolds in an exotic place like Romania does not even start to help the film from slipping down the drain.Hashmi is the only bearable person. Poor man's Karan Singh Grover, Gaurav Arora, looks like he came right out of the Love Games (2016) sets and pretended he was kicking up a fight with his co-star of that film, Patralakeha. No chemistry between any of the couples in the film, unless you consider contrived scenes involving foreplay as romance.Hasmi's films are usually a one-time affair, but this one did not even get the songs right, which is a travesty.BOTTOM LINE: Vikram Bhatt's \"Raaz: Reboot\" tries to reboot itself by manually going to the Windows start menu, clicking on the Power option, and then confirming Restart. The only problem is that before it can complete the action, it gets the infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error, which can only be rectified if you \"shut down and then try again\". Skip it!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO\n",

            "I have seen Do Bigha Zamin many times ( at least five ) but never had a chance to write a review. Every time I see this movie I put my hats off to Mr. Bimal Roy as the director of this masterpiece. I have read comments about having the idea from a different film ( Vittorio Di Sica's Bicycle Thief ) But I can challenge a lot of director to copy any film they want and produce something like Do Bigha Zamin. The scenes of a village in Bengal and the streets of Calcutta ( now Kolkata ) in early fifties are so real - it just sends shivers through my body. I was a student in a Calcutta college during that period and the scenes from Esplanade area, with Metro Cinema, Chowringhee Road, the double decker buses, the trams and finally the human rickshaws were presented in such a way that I felt being there in that period. The poverty of the villagers and as well as the bustee dwellers were very realistic and the characters were portrayed and played extremely well. Some of the scenes like when Paro went to Meena Kumari to get a letter written, the short scene where Nirupa Roy complaining to Balraj Sahni that he does not love her are very touching scenes. One of the other wonders are the boot polish kid Laloo. I don,t know whether he is an actor or real boot polish kid in real life , but he displayed a wonderful piece of acting as the friendly companion to Kanhaiya ( Rattan Kumar ). Nirupa Roy as the wife of the peasant Balraj Sahani, Balraj Sahani himself and Rattan Kunmar all played their parts very well. I should also mention the role played by Rajlakhsmi Devi as the Bustee owner - what can be more realistic than that. Though the economic scene in India has changed over the last sixty years still there are a lot of poverty in India and peasants like Shambhu Mahato can be found all over India. I appreciate the director's last scene where it shows the family is still intact with hope for the future at the same time the struggle for survival goes on as they lost their land to the greedy landlord. I have the DVD and will watch it many more times.\n",

            "'Samay' is one of the best movies of 2003. It stars the beauty queen Sushmita Sen in one of the most meaningful roles of her career. She plays the role of an intelligent cop who is assigned the task of solving the murder of a wealthy businessman. She begins to unearth every clues linking her to the killer.But before she could solve the mystery of the businessman's homicide, another murder takes place. This time a leading actress of the film industry has been murdered. To make matters worse, a famous contact-killer of the city has also been killed.Each murder follows an interesting pattern-the first victim was killed at 12, the second at 3 and the third at 6. And each victim had a defective eyesight with a power of -2. Will Sush be able to stop the killer from carrying out one more crime with impunity or will she fail? The movie is extremely interesting right from the beginning. This is the first movie I have seen that doesn't follow the usual routine of useless songs and dance numbers. There is only one song in the movie, 'Laila Laila' but it was necessary to establish the moves of the second victim before she was murdered.'Samay' scores in almost every department. Cinematography was good and the editing was well-paced. The supporting casts were equally good as the lead cast. Sushant Singh was competitive and so were Dinesh Lamba and Rajesh Khera.As mentioned above, with 'Samay' Sushmita should easily win the critical acclaim that she has longed for from the beginning of her career. She was competitive throughout the movie. No actress can match her given the role of a smart and diligent cop in the movie.The only thing that I don't like in the movie is the climax which was heavy and unsatisfactory.Despite an unsatisfactory ending, watch 'Samay' for pure entertainment.I rate it 8/10.\n",

            "Seeta Aur Geeta is according to me one of the best comedy films ever made in India. Apart from its wonderful screenplay, exceptionally funny proceedings, and the fantastic blend of comedy, romance and action, there's another very good reason to watch it which is also the main reason: Hema Malini. Ramesh Sippy makes a wise choice by casting her as she brings the film to life with her natural charm and beauty. Without a doubt, the script is another winner, and technically the film was quite innovatory for the time. The result is a picture that is terribly entertaining and memorable.Seeta and Geeta, both played by Malini, are identical twin sisters who were separated at birth. 17 years later: Seeta lives unhappily with her paternal uncle and his cruel wife in her deceased parents' mansion, and is literally treated like a slave, while Geeta, who was stolen by a gypsy couple at birth, lives happily a poor lifestyle with her mother. Seeta is presented as a shy, traditional and highly reticent girl, while Geeta is a bubbly, energetic, brave and vivacious girl who works as a street dancer to feed herself and in her free-time is a real prankster who indulges in playing marbles with kids.The comedy of errors begins when Seeta, unable to tolerate her ill-fate any longer, runs away from home, and the two estranged sisters accidentally swap places. This is done through a series of scenes which are full of comedy and humour. The police station sequence is awesome, to say the least. The moment we see Geeta hanging on to the ceiling fan with such comfort is unforgettable. But the greatest fun happens in the big mansion, where the aunt, her brother and daughter think they can maltreat Seeta again. What they don't know is that it is not Seeta, but Geeta! And what happens then is such a hilarious show to watch.It must be noted that it's not just about the comedy; the movie has depth even in the dramatic portions. Seeta's torture is successfully disturbing, and there you can see a great deal of dramatic tension which is often overlooked. Some of the scenes in which Geeta finally makes justice may be entertaining, but they are much more than just that. See Geeta's interaction with her grandmother, the moment she makes the old woman take her real place in the house, the moment she stands up for the servant when he gets physically abused, or the one when she breaks the norm by refusing to count the money brought by the lawyer, placing full trust in his services. You will understand what I'm referring to.Hema Malini, in one of her finest performances ever, is simply splendid and marvelous. She gets two completely different roles to play with very distinct temperaments and personalities (one is a dramatic role and the other is a comic one), and she plays them so brilliantly, skillfully and convincingly that it's impossible to believe it is one woman playing these two characters. As a kid I actually used to think these were two different women who were just similar looking. She is moving and compelling as Seeta, but it's the character of Geeta that remains with you forever, because it shows the most colourful shades of her personality and utilises her superb comic timing to the fullest.The rest of the cast members, including Sanjeev Kumar and Dharmendra, support well. Kumar never ceased to impress with his natural ease and here he is very likable. Dharmendra does exceedingly well as the lonely drunkard. Roopesh Kumar is also well cast as the villain. The elderly women -- Pratima Devi as the grandmother and Radhika Rani as Geeta's foster mother -- are very good, but undoubtedly it is Manorama who stands out as the twins' cruel, evil and hilarious aunt. Her plump, amusingly hypocritical, heavily made-up and caricaturish Kaushalia is according to me one of the most memorable and funny characters in Hindi cinema history. Manorama is just exceptional in a wonderfully acted comic role, which significantly contributes to making this film the classic that it is.R.D. Burman's music is outstanding. All the songs are lovely, from the happily exciting \"Oh Saathi Chal\" to the catchy \"Zindagi Hai Khel\" to the ballad \"Haan Ji Haan\". And speaking of modern, the film portrays the modern-day India very well. Ramesh Sippy's direction is excellent, ditto for the cinematography, the editing and the action. The camera work and the stunts were definitely ahead of the times. The movie never gets boring; it is fast-paced, engaging and interesting. Many films with similar story lines have been made before and after, but frankly they all pale in comparison to this one. Seeta Aur Geeta is one of the best-made Indian films of its time, one of the most accomplished entertainers - a masterful work of timeless proportions.\n",

It was so comical, especially Shahrukh and Mohnish Behl's. It's funny to see everybody like ten years younger. This movie is so slow and unbearable. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. Nothing happens in like over half-an-hour, and then all of a sudden, some major event takes place so abruptly, that you don't have time to register what happened. The movie makes no sense whatsoever. All the important things happen so hastily, and you're left to get bored the rest of the movie. The script is terrible. The songs were the only good part of the film. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place is because I thought, How can I not watch a new SRK flick? Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.\n",

            "After Chota Chetan and Halo, Makdee is one of the finest children films to have hit the Indian screen.Entirely set in a rural backdrop, the movie enthralls the viewer from its very first scene where a minor thief is chased by the villagers and soon after whisked by a spider-woman aka Makdee (Shabana Azmi). No one in the village dares enter this Spiderwomen's mansion for the legend has it that whoever enters the mansion comes out as an animal. Enter twin sisters Chunni and Munni (Shweta Prasad) who are like any other Bollywood twins  bindaas and darpok respectively. Everything goes fine until when one of Chunni's pranks leads Munni into the haunted house where the witch turns her into a hen. To get her sister back Chunni has to deal hundred chickens with the Makdee in exchange.The climax is a surprise where the fairy (oops! witchy) tale turns out to be a conspiracy theory. But the surprise is not much pleasant, as the supernatural element is lost here. The movie still has its moments of ham-free humour and at times horrendously scary ones too (do accompany your kids). The narration is effective and editing perfectly crisp (just 95 minutes runtime but a pure delight).Shabana and the other Makdee (MAKrand Deshpande as the mean butcher) are amazing. Master Alaap Mazgaonkar makes you laugh with his funny face and gestures itself. The movie undoubtedly belongs to Shweta Prasad who gives the best performance of the year (her talent has been much aptly explored than her minuscule bit in the television soap Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki). Kareena and Esha are recommended acting lessons from this little wonder.Finally hats-off to director Vishal Bharadwaj for daring to attempt an offbeat theme  a children's film (when everyone else is busy with crappy love stories) for his debut venture and moreover extracting stupendous performances from the child artistes. He perfectly sets the difference between children films and childish films.At last Indian kids have something sensible and more interesting to watch than Shakalaka Boom Boom and Shaktimaan.\n",

            "This movie is about a Dysfunctinal Family but Not just any Dysfunctional Family. It is about the Family of the Father of our Nation (India) although, the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how The Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son would try to get close the Mahatma would come between them. This is a beautifully done film. Akshaye Khanna has proved himself to be a Top Actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala who mainly stars in Plays-Gurukant Desai's lawyer in Guru has portrayed Gandhi wonderfully.(as a real Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God) Shefali Shah the girl from Monsoon Wedding has also done a really good job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This Movie is touching and so is its soundtrack \"Raghupati Raghava\" sung in a very unique manner.

One of them considers the other his teacher. The junior has so much admiration for the senior that he has renamed himself Banke Bihari (Jatin Goswami) out of respect for his guru, Babu Bihari (Nawazuddin Siddiqui).A weird self realization takes over Banke when he learns that Babu gets paid Rs 25,000 for each murder while he gets only Rs 8,000. That turns their conversation towards inflation and how it has become difficult for hired guns to operate with honesty. In an inebriated state, they challenge each other to murder three people.

Lack of research work is major drawback of this film. First they tried to compensate it with a love track which is also very boring. Love track worsens it further and applies break on already slow movie. There is nothing in the name of story, screenplay, just an information. Dialogues are impressive. What was the inspiration or idea behind making a plane is not there except that an Indian wanted to make it. Execution and obstacles both looks very unreal and childish. Somehow after watching this movie you start doubting that is it fact or fiction as they have presented it in film. Person is genius to think about making a Airplane but not even think a bit about how to control it or land it, trying comes after. Safety measures would have worked or not its another thing but not even thinking about it is not digestible. Premise is Maharashtra but you cant find it neither in language nor in set designs, only speaking few Marathi words do not justify it. Costumes are so bad that the jail dress looks like as night suit. Background score gives feeling that it is not proud of India but dedicated to a particular religion but suddenly took a U turn and started giving feeling of another religion then a tasteless combination of both. Cinematography is good but it is obsessed with pigeon, candle and focus shifting. Performance wise Ayushmann Khurana looks as if he is smiling in sad scenes.

            "After having a successful turn with Kya Kehna, Kundan Shah and Preity Zinta reunite for another picture that revolves entirely around her. This is a film that has it all: comedy, drama, emotions, romance and values. It is portrayed quite well all through, but it certainly wouldn't have worked if not for Preity Zinta. Don't know what it is about her. Watching her on-screen is a refreshing, encouraging experience. Her bright smile, her easy charm, her strong and natural screen presence, and her real-life happiness that translates so naturally onto the screen, all make you believe that life is beautiful. Even when she's sad and you see tears in her expressive eyes which naturally sadden you as well, you cannot but feel optimistic. She switches sorrow with happiness quickly yet convincingly. This is not just the beautiful character she's got, it's Preity herself. Not once has she been called a bubbly and vivacious actress. Her ability to inject even the saddest of characters with her natural zest is unique and commendable. Not many actors can do it, but Preity can.Preity plays Shalu, a girl who is the product of her father's extramarital affair, and who was adapted by her father's wife (Rekha) after his death. Unaware of her identity, she often wonders why her mother does not show even remote affection for her while clearly doing so towards her sister Nimmi (Mahima). Yet, her love for both her mother and her beloved sister is immense and unconditional. As a matter of fact, the bonding and camaraderie between Shalu and Nimmi is one of the most beautifully portrayed sibling relationships and rarely done so convincingly in mainstream films. Shalu never for one moment begrudges her sister for being their mother's preferred child. On the contrary, she is presented as that happy-go-lucky girl who is full of life no matter what. While troubled by her mother's cold and aloof attitude, she does not spend time crying for all ill fate; she fights for her happiness and makes her best to prove her worth. Later in the film, her ability to sacrifice her own happiness for her sister and family brings a new dimension to her, and while it could have made any other actress look cheap and pretentious, Preity is compelling and moving.Shalu is a very simple yet extremely memorable role, and she's unlike any leading lady you've seen in Hindi movies. She is very much a real person, who wears regular everyday clothes (western but not in the glamorous or vulgar sense, as one would imagine), rides a bicycle, slides down the staircase banister, confronts her mother's political rivals, has absolutely no qualms about lying when applying for a new job or trying to get what she wants, and sometimes even likes to play pranks on strangers. Indeed, a character archetype that would be considered too racy or even unseemly for leading ladies just a few years back. But here there's no contradiction between Shalu's independent nature and her commitment to her family. Shalu, if you like, is your girl-next-door, but not the naive one; she is a young, strong woman who knows her mind but has her values intact. Preity integrates her boyish charm into Shalu's mini-negative shades, providing some moments of light, comic relief, as in the scene where she misleads Arjun Rampal's character on his way to the company, or the ones where she mistreats him (\"Hey Driver! Ksh! Ksh!\"). Even the early sequence where she feeds her mother's political rivals a peppered pastry (by the way, the instance when they have smoke coming out of their ears is redundant and annoyingly embarrassing) is entertaining.Rekha is known as one of the greatest actresses, no doubt, and she is restrained and dignified here, but like the beautiful and talented Mahima Chaudhary, she suffers from quite an underwritten role. Mahima, whose mesmerising, impossible beauty is really a work of heavenly art, is lovely and radiant in her part as the kind Nimmi who totally matches her sister's selfless love. Generally speaking, both Rekha and Mahima do really well with whatever little the script gives them, and even the guys, Arjun Rampal and Jimmy Shergill, are competent, but at the end of the day all four of them are merely the background for Miss Preity Zinta. Preity may not be as beautiful as the other ladies; she is neither as dramatically accomplished as Rekha nor as attractive as Mahima, but it's her film all the way, and it never feels wrong that she is the centre of attention. She makes the best of this author-backed role, playing it with spontaneity, energy, depth and sincerity, and, in turn, making Shalu authentic, charming and very easy to relate to. Actually it just never feels like acting, this performance is just real and completely unaffected throughout, and towards the end she really outdoes herself in a couple of hard-hitting scenes. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role of Shalu, and while sadly it never got the amount of notice it deserves to begin with, I have no doubt it has won many hearts and will continue to do so.Dil Hai Tumhaara is not a great film but it is a heartwarming family drama which was made in the most traditional way. Fans of mainstream Hindi films will love it. The last few scenes become increasingly and typically emotional, but they are moving enough and effectively bring to a positive ending. You just feel its profound, unrestrained Hindi film style all over, but it works. All the songs, without exception, are melodious and beautiful. Among my favourites, \"Mohabbat\" is catchy and exhilarating, \"Chayya Hai Jo Dil\" is beautifully sensuous, \"O Sahiba\" is poignant, but it is \"Dil Laga Liya\" which provides the best and most moving moments of the film. The songs are actually very well pictured on-screen, some of them even carry the narrative forward, and all of them are consistently used to showcase Zinta's star quality and her different states throughout the story. Indeed, Zinta is the main and perhaps only reason to watch this film, and if you ask me, it is reason enough.\n",

The trailer was interesting and so is the film. The journey taken by father and son (Lalit Behl and Adil Hussain) is beautifully depicted as the bond grows strong as they spent more time together.

Though the subject of death is serious, the film boast off some satirical moments to keep up the light moments. There is a scene when father is terminally ill and you feel that he is about to die showing the last moments between father and son. Surprisingly, he survives the illness proving that you cannot control Death but it will ultimately control you. The film also succeeds in giving message to take care of old-age parents the same way they take care of you when you are growing up.The second half tends to drag a little bit and could have been made better. However, the beautiful background score along with spectacular capture of ghats of Varanasi will keep you engaged. Shubhashish Bhutiani, as a new director and writer, has the potential to make it big while the performances by the star cast is simply superb.Overall, a beautiful journey with heart-warming moments and superb background score is a must watch. Excellent 4/5\n",

            "This movie is a scene to scene copy of Denzel Washington's \"Man on Fire\". They took the whole movie, added songs to it and a little twist in the end. Other than that, each scene is a ditto copy of the original movie. The irony is that Amitabh Bachchan, who plays Denzel's role in this movie, said in a promo that \"Please watch this movie on big screen and stop piracy\"! What a joke! The film itself is a violation of many copyright laws! On top of that, the script writer(script translator), claims that he wrote this script two years ago but Amitabh didn't like it, so he added a new twist in the end and then Amitabh agreed to do the movie. Watch the original movie \"Man on Fire\". One of the best performances by Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning.\n",

            "'Revolver Rani' is a proper Bollywood satire, consisting of intelligent writing, dark humour and terrific parodies. And I never expected Hindi Cinema to properly pull off such a thing. Other than the smart screenplay, it's Kangana Ranaut's terrific acting prowess which makes the satire effective. The films takes a lot of hilarious jabs at mob rivalries, politics, religious and cultural issues, Bollywood industry, and most of all, our very human nature.Kangana plays the role of the lead protagonist Alka Singh, who is a gun-blazing mob-head and political leader. Brought up without parents, and only by her uncle, she's a cold-hearted leader seduced by an aspiring actor only for his gain. It's the political rivalry between the two mobs which forms the basic premise of the story. The supporting performances are quite commendable, especially that of Piyush Mishra, who plays Alka's uncle.And people who are calling it a remake of Kill Bill are out of their minds. Other than one or two inspired moments from the Taratino Violence saga, the movie is completely original.The movie can only be enjoyed by people who can understand political satires and like black comedies.\n",

            "Hats off to director Mr. Nikhil Advani, who choose a tough path of making a meaningful film rather than following the common path of making a commercial cinema. Making an animation and meaningful film is complete risk in Bollywood but he took the challenge and proved himself right. This film is sweetly entertaining. Camera angle used in story telling keeps the pace of film on very good note. Animation is done creatively. Especially the bee animation is mind blowing. Most of the voice dubbing is done by known bollywood actors but Govinda's voice is superb. Wow, you can't stop smiling to hear him. He is brilliant. Rest Akshay Khanna, Boman Irani, Urmila Matondkar and Saurav Shukla are also fine but Govinda is outstanding. Story, screenplay is very good. Dialogues are fantastic. Great work by writers team Mr. Nikhil Advani, Girish Dhamija, Suresh Nair and Milap Zaveri. They have even touched a very sensitive issue of Tiger saving in a scene, which was heart touching. 3D impact is not up to mark but when subject and narration touch your emotions, you don't bother about other things. Music score by Shankar Ehsan Loy is very good. You would feel that you are simply watching a typical Bollywood movie. Even animated choreography justifies it. Overall, it has all ingredients of a good film, drama, emotion and entertainment. Please go and watch with your lovely kids. They will enjoy as well as you.\n",

            "Well, Dil Ka Rishta is a poorly written melodrama which offers nothing special to its audiences except for some moments here and there and a beauty named Aishwarya Rai. The story is clichéd and pointless, and the proceedings are nothing but ordinary and uninteresting series of events which make absolutely no sense. At times I felt it was just made for the sake of making. The film's music is also not particularly good, which is a great disappointment since I've always liked Nadeem Shravan's compositions regardless of how much I enjoyed a film. The title song is nice though. The film stars Aishwarya Rai in the leading role of Tia. She is beautiful, that's something that has been said a million times already but it's not enough to carry the film, especially considering that her acting is not very impressive in this film and she is just okay. See movies like Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam to understand how the combination of her beauty and acting makes wonders. Arjun Rampal is also okay though in his favour it can be said that he tried his best. Talents like Isha Koppikar and Paresh Rawal are once again wasted, and sadly so. To sum it up, Dil Ka Rishta is a forgettable film which could be easily skipped or avoided.\n",

Series than myself- I realize Paul Fusco was a big fan having created the series however I never would have allowed this stink-filled script to destroy the laugh filled memories of the Alf Franchise. The first couple of minutes between Alf and Beverly Archer(Harriette Byrd in past episodes) was funny but then the film isn't about Alf so much as Military abuse of authority and the love story of two young Doctors who befriend Alf while he is in captivity with the Alien Task Force. The story line is beyond awful and filled with straight line after straight line. The rest of the original cast is gone- and how many laughs did we get from Max Wrights' dead pan deliveries and exaggerated befuddlement? There were so many alternative stories after the final T.V. episode why Fusco chose the worst possible direction is beyond me (maybe he was hanging with Jerry Stahl at the time of conceiving this project) I say to anyone who in later years discovers the Alf television show to stay away from this movie- it is lame unfunny and a pile of steaminess. I compare it to the let down of Highlander 2- it's that very very very bad.\n",

            "Jaanam Samjha Karo is a very nice watch for the entire family. Urmila Matondkar plays Chandni, a young girl who works as a nightclub dancer and singer to feed her family. She meets a handsome womaniser named Rahul, played by Salman Khan. Rahul's grandfather, played by the great Shammi Kapoor, comes to visit him and keeps insisting that he finally get married, and Rahul asks Chandni to pretend to be his wife. She does so, and his grandpa is charmed by the young girl who has great values. Rahul does not take Chandni seriously, but she falls in love with him. But then, when his grandpa leaves, she decides to do the same. Will something or someone change this? Go and watch to find out. The film has everything a Hindi commercial flick of its sort needs: very melodious songs, charming romance, good stars, nice story, solid dialogues, amazing locations and many emotions. Salman Khan and Urmila Matondkar have a very good chemistry together. Shame they didn't work as much together. Khan is very good as Rahul, but the film belongs to Urmila, who is wonderful in an all-out mainstream flick. She manages to make the sensitive Chandni a real woman of substance with her intense style and forceful dialogue delivery. Shammi Kapoor is very, very likable as Rahul's grandpa. The film is light and entertaining, it does get a bit overdone at times (though I still can name a few filmmakers who would have turned it into an unbearable soap), but is generally an interesting watch despite some of its flaws. I recommend.\n",

            "Aa Ab Laut Chale is one of the most under appreciated films of the 1990's. The film really deserved to do much better business than it did, something I would attribute to some very poor marketing and release timing. Anyhow the film itself is quite entertaining and although as most Bollywood films it is bereft with cliches and an oft presented story line, it still succeeds in keeping the viewer interested and entertained. Rishi Kapoor in his directorial debut has done quite a competent job and I give him credit for not letting the film from becoming overly melodramatic as most such films from Bollywood. Almost all in the cast do a pretty competent job, although no one really stands out as brilliant. The music is quite good grows on you the more you listen to it. Rajesh Khanna in a non publicized 'sort of comeback' role, performs well but is hampered by a limited role. All in all it is one of the really better films of 1999.\n",

            "This movie is an ambitious daring film for its time. Although the whole story and dialog is reminiscent with a theatrical (broadway like) play where costumes, symbolic acts, and singing dialogs reveal the story. It must have been extremely hard to orchestrate into a film, and unfortunately with little success. The nice thing about this film is that symbolism is well crafted and touch upon relevant issues in every country but mostly India. I started noticing the symbolism in simple things attributed in the movie which shows the director's appeal for an intellectual audience. Another nice thing is that the film makes use of Shah Rukh Khan's exuberant energy in a satisfying manner. The acting was well for the genre of the film, but very theatrical like and at times you feel the un comfortable switch between screen and theater actors which makes it hard to move through scenes. The songs are bad but its inevitable when many critical story and thematic words are being used. Deepa Sahi is not the perfect choice to pair with Shah Rukh. She constantly looks like his mother rather than his love interest. She can't carry the character at all and over-does it many times. Their pairing in the two movies they did together must have been of the worst i have ever seen for Shah Rukh.. and i have seen them all. But i guess she is the director's favorite (or upper hand) and i can't think of another actress for the film, but i know any younger, more Indian girl would have been better. Many actors in this movie are recognizable as supporting role actors, so this film must have been a break in their struggling period. This is a somewhat black comedy but it is not a comedy. Its an over dramatized to fantastical measures to fit the critical issues it is addressing. Overall, it is worth a watch if you like Shah Rukh Khan, symbolic films, or a brief encounter with India's struggle for life is an artistic way.\n",

            "'Dus Kahaniyaan' is very much a collection of 10 shorts. None of the stories have anything to do with the other. 6 directors tell their story in 10 short films but only a few are worth watching.Apoorva Lakhia's \"Sex on the Beach\": These days one can only expect sleaze where Dino Morea is concerned and this one provides that. It looks like the sleazy version of a story from 'Darna Mana Hai' except this one is boring. Tarina Patel in a cheap bikini trying to pull off Ursula Andreas's famous walk-from-the-sea scene is laughable. This is the worst short of them all.Sanjay Gupta's \"Rise & Fall\": I don't understand why Gupta chose to tell this uninteresting story that has been told x number of times already. Well, it is quite known that Gupta is a hack so nothing new there. Sanjay Dutt is decent and Sunil Shetty is bad. The cinematography is good but the action sequences are overdone.Sanjay Gupta's \"Strangers in the Night\": The twist in this one will make viewers laugh. From erotic it turns to preachy. Why were these two people having this conversation? Mahesh Manjrekar was lame and Neha Dhupia was alright (she looks sizzling).Hansal Mehta's \"High on the Highway\": Another pointless uninteresting story. It tries to be dark but ends up being too messy. Jimmy Shergill hams when he's screaming but otherwise he's okay. Ditto for Masumi Makhija.Sanjay Gupta's \"Matrimony\": This is a poor adaptation of Roald Dahl's 'The Colonel's Coat'. It lacks the wit of the original short story and the characters aren't that interesting. Arbaaz Khan fails to impress while Mandira Bedi and Sudhanshu Pandey are just okay.Jasmeet Dhodhi's \"Lovedale\": What i liked about this one was Anuradha Patel. OK, she was there only in one scene (and does a good job) but it's remarkable to see how little she's changed in 20 years (I last saw her in 'Ijaazat'). The story is nice but seems a little too rushed, hence unbelievable. Anupam Kher is forgettable. Neha Oberoi looks sleepy and Aftab Shivdasani is average.Sanjay Gupta's \"Zahir\": This is one of those stories with a message. It's not as engaging but what makes it watchable is Manoj Bajpai's performance. The actor displays Saahil's easy-going nature, his loneliness and his sexual frustration with tremendous ease. Diya Mirza shows improvement as an actress.Meghna Gulzar's \"Pooranmashi\": A tragic tale of a mother and daughter. It's one of the shortest stories but also most effective. Amrita Singh is fantastic and Minisha Lamba is really cute and does a fine job. The story is a little predictable but this one engages far more than the other seven mentioned above.Sanjay Gupta's \"Gubbare\": A touching story. The story sounds familiar but the dialogues seem genuine. Gupta does a good job with this one. Nana Patekar is wonderful. Rohit Roy and Anita Hassandani are very competent. This is a nice one.Rohit Roy's \"Rice Plate\": Save the best for last. This one is the best among the 10 shorts not only because of two of the most accomplished actors, but also because of the way the story is told. Roy tackles relevant issues concerning religion and prejudice but he does it with a wonderful balanced sense of humour, that doesn't prevent the message to get through. It's great to see Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi work together after years. Azmi is hilarious as the eccentric Brahmin while Shah downplays his part with dignity. Rohit Roy shows great promise as a director and perhaps this is a career-path he can consider. This one is a treat to watch.On the whole, it is the last three shorts that I liked the most while the rest did not make much of an impression but one big flaw is that none of the stories are original and most of them have been plagiarized. I'd say watch it only for the three good.\n",

            "Ardh Satya is an excellently made film. Govind Nihalani leaves no stone unturned in his portrayal of the trials and tribulations of the main character Anant Velankar. He never wanted to be a policeman, but he reluctantly accepted the job because circumstances forced him to as his domineering father did not give him any other option. Now, as a policeman, Anant is honest, hard-working and justice-seeking. No, not at all what we get to see in mindless action films with their exaggerated portrayals of policemen going all nuts over their profession and their fake patriotism being the main issue. Here you will not see any of the silly action sequences or the caricature villains. Ardh Satya is a realistic film, its authenticity is more present than anything else in it. It's a true depiction of the life of an Indian cop and it does not submit to stereotypes, which could have been the easiest way to go.As Anant, Om Puri plays a man who tries to fight criminals and those who break the low, but ends up having to fight against injustice within the system itself. This movie is just his story, not necessarily as a cop. It's about his dedication to his job, his frustration, his deterioration and fall from grace. Nihalani directs this feature with great integrity, and Vijay Tendulkar's script and dialogues are fantastic. Anant's relationships with those who surround him are aptly portrayed. The sequences showing his interaction with Jyotsna, a young lecturer of literature, are stupendous and are of the best in the film, right from their first meeting which opens the film to the time when they are already considering a future marriage. There isn't a lot of romanticism about it, but there's a lot of humanity and respect. Even the portrayal of his relationship with his parents, in spite of the minimal screen time it is given, is spot on and is very troubling.Ardh Satya is a one-man show, and needless to say, it is Om Puri who dominates the proceedings with his heartfelt, brilliant performance as Anant. Puri is an actor who has very rarely delivered something unworthy, although he has been given stuff unworthy of his talent. This performance ranks amongst the finest works of his illustrious career. He captures Anant's honesty, determination, anger and devastation with sheer intensity, and is always moving, credible and convincing. The acting in general is very good in this film, but the rest of the cast are just here to support him, and they do it well. Amrish Puri, as the tough, violent and authoritarian father, is unsurprisingly excellent. He manages to convey a lot of his character's essence through just a few scenes. The same can be said about Sadashiv Amrapurkar, who does a lot with so little. Shafi Inamdar is also pretty good as Anant's boss.Last but certainly not least, Smita Patil is first-rate in a role that was totally in need of someone with her intellectual capabilities and would have turned into inconsequential by a lesser actress. This is not at all one of those powerful author-backed roles she was known for playing, but it's still a very special one in her career. She does not try to impress or steal the show. As Jyotsna, she is natural, pleasant and exudes a certain warmth that is missing in the film. Above all, she had the ability to listen. I highly recommend you to observe the scene in which Anant shares with her his deep devastation towards the end. This scene, devoid of clichés, is one of the finest in the film, showing Om Puri's highpoint but at the same time Patil's wonderfully unconventional reaction of just being there, quietly listening and ultimately lending him a hand of support. The film's climax is most unexpected, and Ardh Satya is overall an excellent, involving movie that is highly recommended.\n",

            "Despite the great success of this film, Chandni is quite frankly one of Yash Chopra's weakest films in terms of script. I mean, it's too typical to be convincing: a girl loves a guy, then he has an accident and becomes invalid, he doesn't want her anymore because he thinks she is too good for him, she leaves, she meets another guy who falls for her. Before they marry, the second guy meets the first guy, who all of a sudden is no longer invalid, and as expected they become friends. That's when we get a very typical love triangle and some annoyingly melodramatic proceedings, more tears than real emotion. The climax and the ending are predictable to the core, and in many instances throughout the film the dialogues are quite cheap (\"Oh my love for her made me a normal person again\").But the film is not that bad after all and has good points too. It flows well, the music is beautiful and the film is well-located. Sridevi is the main highlight of the film with her natural acting, trademark saris and well danced song numbers. One particular instrumental dance number to which she dances in the fields is astonishing, and she looks so smashing hot! The film is considered to be a classic today, and I do understand why. This clearly is not because the film is exceptionally good, but the fact that it brought a huge welcome change to commercial Hindi cinema after several years of mindless and violent action films. The film re-introduced romantic musicals which were endearing and visually beautiful, and were somehow lost and assimilated in the 1980s. It's great that the one who reintroduced them is Yash Chopra, the one who actually makes them best.\n",

A very weird season with aliens, the devil, a angel, and some very twisted nuns. I feel like the ending definitely could have been better but other than that this season really didn't disappoint.Season 3 (coven) 9.1/10 Is a great season ! Tarissa farmiga and Evan peters really didn't disappoint. I loved every minute of this season and it is one of my favouritesSeason 4 (freak show) 7.7/10 This season was a step down but still really entertaining Emma roberts character was a let down and I didn't like a lot of the characters. I did love the fact pepper returned and Finn witrocks performance was excellent. This season had one of the best endings but overall wasn't the best seasonSeason 5 (hotel) 8.4/10 I know a lot of people didn't enjoy this season but I found it really great. The first few episodes were a big let down but the rest was excellent. Evan peters character was really well acted and I really enjoyed lady gaga's character.Season 6 (Roanoke) I honestly couldn't watch this season. I watched the first few episodes and it was a big disappointment.from what I've saw I'd give it a 5.0/10Season 7 (cult) 7.9/10 There is a lot of controversy on this season but I thought it was great. The first 4 or 5 episodes aren't great but I really enjoyed the rest. Its got a crazy ending and in my opinion Evan peters deserved a Emmy for his performance as KaiSeason 8 (apocalypse) 9.1/10 Absolutely brilliant! The return of one of the best seasons, coven and murder house, and they handled it great unlike a lot of shows returning something would do. Evan peters character was a let down because it was a very average character and was only in a few episodes, except for his performance as tate Langton, this was one of the best seasons and didn't fail to entertain me. On of the most twisted endings this show has hadSeason 9 (1984) 7.9/10 A very enjoyable season but did get a little boring they made most of the season 1 night. And Emma roberts character was extremely boring and generic. I was really disappointed Evan peters wasn't in this season. Montana's character was one of the best this show has had.

            "Sunil Darshan's Ek Rishtaa presents the ultimate big wealthy Indian family with all its ups and downs and their struggle in times of happiness and in times of hardship, The movie is quite watchable for the most part but its execution is at times overdone although it's more realistic and not as melodramatic as that same year's Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, which dealt with a similar subject, though the latter is definitely a better film. Just like K3G, Ek Rishtaa is primarily centred around the relationship of a father and his eldest son, their conflict of minds, resulting dispute and ultimate reconcilement, only that here the problems begin more because of conspiracies and misunderstandings. The movie shows how domestic peace is destroyed with the entrance of new members into the family, but the better part of the film shows how the family reunites and everything is settled when turbulent times of crisis seem so disruptive that they bring them together before it's too late. Some of the film's dialogues are very good but some are very theatrical and the same can be said about the proceedings.Two of the biggest pluses of the movie are the music, composed by Nadeem-Shravan, and the multi-starred cast. My favourite songs in the movie are \"Mohabbat Ne Mohabbat Ko\" and \"Ek Dil Hai\" which are melodious and beautifully shot. Where acting goes, Amitabh Bachchan is excellent as the proud father, and Raakhee does very well as his supportive wife in a role that finally does not require her to lose her mental sanity. Akshay Kumar gets a very good role and he plays it with evident dedication and sincerity. I never saw him taking a role so seriously and he is very good in many parts, though sometimes he is a bit let down by the script. Karisma Kapoor is okay but in some scenes she totally overacts. The scenes in which she asks her husband not to return home was quite ridiculous because I could not see the logic behind them. Juhi Chawla is generally credible but I really wondered why a woman would remain with a husband who destroyed her family. Mohnish Bahl is average in a negative role and the rest of the cast are mostly so-so.All in all, Ek Rishtaa is a generally watchable movie despite its flaws. It is nowhere a great film, and its depiction makes it look rather dated and reminiscent of those family films of the 1960, but I recommend you to watch it for the songs, for some of the performances, particularly Bachchan and Kumar's working chemistry, and for its message which conveys the importance of unity and togetherness. This movie, along with Jaanwar, is the best of Sunil Darshan, who is otherwise known for his abysmal movies.\n",

            "\"It horrifies me that ethics is only an optional extra at Harvard Business School\". - John HarveyFinally, a refreshing film that deals with disgusting realities of some of these top-notch private schools in India: donation issues, discrimination against children based on their parents' financial status, the obnoxious atmosphere that reality TV shows create in a school's learning environment and unbridled interference by corporate trustees in school affairs. The message of Pattshaala is simple - left to its own devices and without proper checks and controls, the teaching profession, one of the few remaining noble professions in this country, can also become victim of the same corrupt mindset that presently plagues other institutions especially corporate ones - putting profits before people, considering the end more important than the means and the top-down strategy of creating an environment of fear by dangling the carrot of money and the threat of expulsions. The film is indeed a hard-hitting commentary on the impact that can take place over an entire organization (in this case, a school) when the leader (the Principal, played by Nana Patekar) decides to compromise core ethical values, and buckle under outside influence to create an unlivable atmosphere in the school, for both students as well as teachers. Against this backdrop, a lone protagonist (played by Shahid Kapur) resists, rising up to unify all teachers and students in questioning the decisions of the management and Principal, and giving a live demo to their pupils that passive resistance is the only way to achieve social justice. An oft-quoted liner from the film, \"The age of revolutions is not been relegated to the past. It can occur anytime, anywhere today.\" Indeed, for too long we Indians have relied on Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose and other charismatic leaders of the independence era to find our ethical compass as a nation- fact remains, with each passing generation, we need a new set of leaders, young and dynamic, who are able to selflessly dedicate themselves to refashion the youth's moral fabric. And let me add, such people do exist. But, the media largely ignores their contributions, instead focusing on uninspiring and irrelevant stories that glorifies all sorts of scoundrels I see on TV today.In summary, Patahshaala is a must-watch film, and a real exercise in coming face to face with your moral backbone. The film poses an interesting set of questions - what should one do when faced with dilemmas that are faced by the school principal depicted in the film. Indeed, the author is of the opinion that ethics should be a compulsory subject in all primary schools of the country, and also institutions of higher learning, no matter what the stream is, technical or non- technical. Well, we do have something called \"social studies\" in schools but in my opinion, the subject can be broadly restructured to incorporate a strong ethical element, that too with practical lessons. Past studies has shown that if children are exposed to ethical decision- making through intensive class- room discussions, they're more likely to grow up into well-rounded citizens as adults, and question the wrongs and moral decay in society. Performances by all lead characters were good, and thoroughly convincing. A few characters, such as that of the repugnant school administrator were a bit over-the-top and exaggerated, but understandable from the point of view of the script - there's no point in showing such characters in grey. Their underlying motive is abhorrent, and should be exposed in the true light.\n",

I first took a look at the cast list and was quite impressed with the star list. With names like Sonali Bendre, Aftab, Fardeen Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Twinkle Khanna, and Dilip Tahil, I was amazed to see a multistarrer of such proportions. What really excited me, however, was the director. E. Niwas who had directed the flawless Shool a year and half ago was also directing this film. I immediately rented this one out with high expectations. And, to say the least, I'm not really disappointed, though it could've been better. Story: Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega sums up the entire story line. Starting out with hilarious narration by Paresh Rawal, we learn the problems of the main protaginists and their stories. Sapna (Sonali Bendre) is a really bad artist, but Prakash (Saif Ali Khan) has fallen in love with her for the money. They wed and Prakash gets everything he wants, except respect from his baoji (Dilip Tahil), Rajiv Kapoor, a wealthy industrialist. He plans a new website, but is unable to get funding from Rajiv. Meanwhile, Rahul (Fardeen Khan) is already in love with Anjali (Twinkle Khanna), but is unable to hold onto a steady job, and thus is unable to pay the rent for his apartment, owned by Anjali's Tamil-speaking father. Rahul lives with Harry (Aftab), a lazy man who wants to become rich without working. And so begins the story. Somehow, fate conspires and brings Rahul and Harry to Prakash, where Prakash devises a plan to get money. It involves kidnapping Sapna, and holding her ransom to get money from Rajiv. Each have their own uses for the money. Prakash to start a new business and earn respect. Rahul to get a job (one which requires a bribe) and to pay off the landlord. Harry to travel the world and pay off Aslam Bhai (Johnny Lever), the local chor, who wants to become an actor some day.The story is quite interesting and compelling, but inside all the pretty wrappings, it comes down to a \"man wants to marry woman, but father disagrees\" story. Still, the story is pretty interesting and makes the movie fun to watch, with a bunch of twists thrown in for good measure. Rating: 7/10Acting: LKLKBK comes out quite well in this department. With a multistarrer cast, one would expect it to excell, however. Twinkle Khanna is given almost nothing to do, other than look pretty. Sonali Bendre is ok, but all she does is whine and cry (and look pretty). Saif surprised me. I usually dislike his acting, but his comic timing in this movie was great. He was especially memorable in the scene where he tries to fake sadness and anguish. Fardeen Khan is pretty good, playing the part of a man in need of a job convincingly. Aftab, however, is the big surprise of the movie. After seeing him in Kasoor, I couldn't expect a good comic performance from him. How wrong I was. Aftab is extremely funny in this movie, with a more subtle humor than one would expect in a typical film. And Aftab along with Fardeen make an extremely funny team throughout the movie. Johnny Lever is also funny in his parts, especially his acting scenes and his meetings with Aaj Kapoor. Dilip is, of course, great as the objectional father, and is funny at times. Rating: 9/10Direction/Technical editing The direction is excellent, with scenes flowing extremely well. E. Niwas has proved his excellence as a solo director, ready to take on the previous greats of Bollywood. However, the editing is a little weak. Some of Johnny Lever's scenes are a tad longer than required, and other scenes are a tad short. Rating: 9/10Songs: If LKLKBK has a weak point, this is it. The songs, composed by Vishal Bhardwaj are boring, and most are worth skipping. The picturization for a few songs are good, but nothing new. The only song worth watching is Aslam Bhai, both for its picturization, and its fun lyrics. Rating: 5/10Favorite Scenes This movie has several great scenes, but three really stick out as the most hilarious: The Sonali kidnapping scene, the Saif crying scene, and the Aslam Bhai \"acting mechanics\" scene. Also, for some reason, the scenes where the landlord keeps switching between Hindi and Tamil (between Fardeen and his family) is fun to watch. Rating: 10/10DVD review This is where the film (not necessarily the movie) truly faultors. The DVD is pure BS. Sure, it has the standard Hindi movie features of song and chapter menus and subtitles, along with an extremely fun-loving \"Making of...\" feature, but Video Sound needs to learn how to make DVDs that people will enjoy. You see, the problem is that when you start the DVD up, you have to sit through ads. 10 minutes of ads! And, to make it worse, they're all the same. Half are ads for Tum Bin, and the other half for Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ka. They're not even midly entertaining to watch once, and watching them everytime you start the movie is absolutely rediculous. They're impossible to skip over, even after trying all possible tricks to get p a s s e d it. Thus, I can only recommend this DVD for a rent, and nothing close to a purchase (unless you have that much patience). Rating: 2/10Overall: This is a great movie to watch a few times. It's extremely funny with more intelligent humor than your average movie (similar to Hera Pheri in that aspect). Not a movie to be missed, but I would recommend leaving this in the store due to the horrendous DVD. Rating of movie (not an average): 8.3 Rating of movie with DVD (not an average): 7.1\n",

            "Similar stories have come up, but this strains on medical negligence. The secondary aspects are various forms of crime that are ubiquitous and known. But what is unique here is the topic and the makers have carved it well to touch where it hurts.Cast performance is very good, especially Kay Kay Menon showing absolute genius. Editing & music is a let-down. The underlying relationships actually worked against suspense plot. Dialogs are worn-out. Certain sequences were useless but still the screenplay keeps the viewers hooked, just because we want to know what happens next. It is a very fine thriller based on borrowed factors.BOTTOM LINE: A engaging watch and a must for budding doctors. Recommended! 7.0/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "Hum Aapke ... is basically a case of real talent gone to waste. The plot is interesting and even intriguing but at the end, the film disappoints, even by Hindi movie standards, with a stagnant, slow-moving screenplay and overdone performances.To give credit where credit is due, Kajol's performance is great and she could be said to have carried the movie on her back. Her character was portrayed beautifully and complemented everyone else's. The biggest flaw in the movie was the ending, which was over-dramatized and took away from the movie instead of adding to it. At the end, Kajol's character still remained misunderstood. From the beginning, the audience is led to believe that Anil is finally going to come around, but it wasn't really clear how his character felt and how and when he finally did come around. It seemed as though he decided to go back to his wife, not because he fell in love with her, but because of the gratitude he felt towards her, which does not address the void Kajol's character was feeling throughout the movie. A potentially good plot gone to waste.The comedic subplot was repetitive and completely unrelated to the movie; hint: keep your thumb on the fast-forward button.The songs are mediocre at best, and the first one (which includes a Hindi rap) is off the charts as far as horrid music goes. This movie is worth a watch only if your other choices are unavailable.\n",

            "This film was more slapstick than horror, but it also had charm. I don't believe this film was meant to be a serious comment on the British Asian way of life, just a wry look at the lengths this mother would go to in order to secure a husband for her daughter. The characters were engaging, making me want to know what was going to happen to them all, and I never yawned once, which is a good barometer of an entertaining film in my opinion. Some scenes had me wanting to jump up and join in, while another was an obvious homage to a 70's horror movie, but with an amusing twist. If you want cerebral,don't bother, but if you want to have a laugh, go for it.\n",

            "In 2000, Khalid Mohammed, a famous film critic, directed a movie called Fiza. Fiza is one of my favourite films, and I particularly loved the great performance of its leading lady, Karisma Kapoor. In this film, Khalid Mohammed assumes a part as a writer. The one who directs this movie is none other than Shyam Benegal, one of India's all-time best filmmakers, and the one who plays the title role is Karisma Kapoor. This is the third movie in the unofficial trilogy of Benegal movies scripted by Mohammed, all of which are partly fictionalised true stories centred around Indian Muslim women who made a lasting impact on Mohammed's life. The first movie in the trilogy is the brilliant Mammo, which was based on Mohammed's beloved grandaunt, and the second is Sardari Begum, titled after a popular Thumari singer of his mother's era. Both characters actually appear in this movie. But here Mohammed tells the story of Zubeidaa Begum, who was his real mother.Zubeidaa Begum was the daughter of a famous filmmaker and an aspiring actress. When her father, who disapproved of her dreams to pursue an acting career, found out she was acting secretly in films, he arranged her marriage to Mehboob Alam. However, right after Zubeidaa gave birth to a baby boy, they divorced. Zubeidaa was a charming, high-spirited, incredibly honest and rebellious woman who refused to live her life according to traditional mores and was constantly in search of happiness. One such opportunity presents itself in the form of Maharaja Vijayendra Singh, the prince of Fatehpur, who is already married to a much older Mandira Devi. Vijayendra instantly falls for Zubeidaa, and she leaves everything behind her, including her little son whom her father does not allow to take, to enter his house as his second wife. The story relates Zubeidaa's trials and tribulations in the big house, her loneliness and yearning for her son and for her husband, who has very little time for her.The story of Zubeidaa is convincingly narrated and is efficiently presented through flashbacks as told to the character of Riyaz, Zubeidaa's elder son who is now a journalist trying to find some documentation of who his mother was. He is surprised to hear that she was a charismatic woman who lived life to the fullest, and the movie is authentic enough to make the viewer feel a connection to the story and to its main protagonist. Unsurprisingly, Shyam Benegal's direction is excellent and he unusually accepts many of the ingredients of mainstream Hindi cinema, which certainly sets this movie apart from his previous directorial efforts. He is aided by Mohammed's script, Javed Siddiqui's fantastic dialogues, the terrific sound design, the wonderful cinematography, and of course the art direction; the sets, the costumes and the props all successfully capture the atmosphere of the 1950s. One cannot go without mentioning A.R Rahman's music which gives life to the film. \"So Gaye Hain\" is the finest song in the soundtrack and its melody is really calm, haunting and melancholic.The one who is most responsible for making Zubeidaa the movie that it is and the character so memorable is unquestionably Karisma Kapoor. After delivering an all-time great performance as the main protagonist in Khalid Mohammed's Fiza, she is now cast in the role of his mother to deliver another performance of equally high standards. Shyam Benegal once frankly stated that he actually had not seen a single movie of hers before, and therefore he directed her with utmost guidance. Kapoor's portrayal is indeed heartfelt, real and powerful, and she displays Zubeidaa's feisty nature, determination, yearning, anger and frustration with energy, depth and conviction that make her really easy to relate to. Manoj Bajpai is very fine as Zubeidaa's loving husband. Rekha is superb as Mandira. She is amazingly restrained and graceful and is mysterious enough to make one wonder what her real take was. The supporting cast includes Amrish Puri, Surekha Sikri, Rajit Kapoor and Lillete Dubey, and all of them manage to leave a mark.Zubeidaa's ending is really poignant, but its melancholic and bittersweet feel actually explains why Zubeidaa Begum will be remembered. It's great that Mohammed decided to immortalise his mother even though he sadly did not even know her that much in her life and her portrait existed in his mind only from stories he had heard from those who knew her. Anyway, kudos to Mohammed, Benegal and Karisma Kapoor for making Zubeidaa the entertaining and moving picture that it is.\n",

            "Hrishikesh Mukherjee could never disappoint. Nor could Gulzar. Here Mukherjee directs a film scripted by Gulzar and the result is an excellent film in all respects - real, intelligent, moving. The movie starts well and keeps growing on you as it proceeds. This is a story of two brother-like friends, Somu (Khanna) and Vicky (Bachchan). Somu lives a poor lifestyle with his mother and sister while Vicky is the son of a wealthy businessman who runs a huge factory in Bombay. When Vicky's father has a heart attack and is advised to take bed-rest, Vicky takes his place. He has a confrontation with the union leader, Bipinlal, as a result of which a strike takes place and he is forced to apologise in public. He confides Somu about his humiliation, and the two plan to take revenge on the poor honest man. Somu poses as a labourer in the factory, befriends his fellow-workers, wins their confidence by arranging them several contrived benefits, and ultimately takes Bipilal's place as the union leader. But while the mission gets completed, Somu finds it difficult to leave. He gradually gets close to the people and gets increasingly involved with their life troubles, which makes him look at things differently.This social drama is brilliantly written - an interesting story, a tight conflicted script, awesome dialogues. Mukherjee's direction is excellent as always, and the film is brilliantly executed. The depiction of poverty and hardship among people from the lower middle class is spot on and at points really manages to tug at your heartstrings. That makes it easier to understand Somu's involvement with the world of simple villagers, a world he actually belongs to but an involvement which could smash his friendship with Vicky. This conflict of interests is well brought out by Mukherjee. The film of course presents a clash of opposing economic worlds, but it works essentially because of the human relationship between the two friends, which is extremely well done. Somu and Vicky are very different, the former being soft-spoken, simple and generous, and the latter being hot-tempered, proud and a bit aggressive. Yet their friendship is convincing and it's clear that each one of them would do anything for the other. Rajesh Khanna plays Somu exceedingly well, and his character is very easy to relate to. But it is clearly Amitabh Bachchan's film. As Vicky, he delivers an impressive performance by creating a tough, dignified and stylish persona. His decisiveness, inner conflict, anger and care for a friend are excellently displayed, and everything--from his facial expressions to his line delivery to his body language--is incredibly forceful. Apart from Bachchan and Khanna, the cast includes many good actors, all of whom perform well. A very young Rekha appears in a tiny role as the sassy Shyama and she is very charming. Simi Garewal plays the intelligent and educated Manisha with grace. A.K. Hangal is outstanding and likable as Bipinlal. Om Shivpuri does a good job as Vicky's dad and he gets some of the better dialogues in this film. Raza Murad is wonderful as Alam, an alcoholic poet who befriends Somu. So are Durga Khote and actress Manisha who play Somu's mother and sister.Namak Haram is one of many great films made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and written by Gulzar, with a beautiful soundtrack composed by master RD Burman and some memorable performances. I recommend you to watch Namak Haram - it is entertaining, it is moving, it is heartbreaking, it is a classic.\n",

Raina is no Henry Fonda; but he's done a great job -- as has the rest of the very talented cast; and none more than the brilliant Pankaj Kapoor as the broken-hearted father/juror no 3 (played by Lee J. Cobb in the original) Ironically, what makes it work is the fact that it is such a complete plagiarism; it is guided entirely by Lumet's masterpiece in style and substance. The cast and the crew have done an excellent job with the execution; but they could have probably done it without the director. An interesting artifact of the plagiarism is that we have this movie about a hung jury -- when India doesn't have a jury system at all! Oh well! Given that Bollywood is all about plagiarism anyway; I guess we should be thankful when they occasionally do a good job of it!\n",

When big studios hav started making horror flicks like Insidious, Annabelle, The Unborn, The rite, Conjuring, etc. there is no chance of cheesy Hindi horror flicks like these. Anyways I gave a 6 jus for the effort. But some of the scenes were total rip off. Like the scene where the possessed person walks on both legs n hands (the unborn). Even the scene where the spirit enters the body while the person is lying on the bed (cannot recall the name). The mirror thing is getting monotonous. The concept of another world in the mirror is getting stale. The only movie which pulled off the mirror/another world concept was a segment from the movie VHS 2. Another rip off is the one when the images from the photos scream. The black eyes n sealed lips r too getting monotonous. I always wonder, y a possessed person has to do hyperextension of their joints. The movie has nothing new to offer. Worst were the cgi effects. The scene where Sharman n his girlfriend standing in a desert in the middle of nowhere. Too ridiculous man. Even one of my fav scene from one of my fav movie, The Shrine (the statue scene) was badly incorporated in this. The makers of this flick shud watch small budget horror flicks (indie horror) from Hollywood.\n",

            "For years, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam has been known as an inalienable asset in the history of the Hindi film industry, and not without a reason. The movie fully deserves to be called a timeless classic and its story is relevant and fascinating even today, almost half a century after its release. It is an artistic and intriguing presentation of the nature of passion and desire. Guru Dutt was a master of his craft. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is excellent in story, writing, execution and acting. The music is sublime, the sets are fantastic, and the movie exemplifies what true cinematographic excellence of those times was. It is shot beautifully, with a background score that enlightens the film's melancholic mood. The film is quiet, focused and balanced, and has a very subtle feel to it thanks to all these aspects. Abrar Alvi's direction is superb - he captures the atmosphere of those times with great skill, his script is marvelous, and many of his rich dialogues remain memorable even today and are often cited by lovers of Hindi cinema. All said and done, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam wouldn't have been what it is if not for the transcendent performance of the divine Meena Kumari. Her mesmerising beauty, grace and screen presence cannot be described in words, but to put it simply, when she was on-screen, no one else existed. Her portrayal of the tormented and deeply frustrated Chhoti Bahu is both heartfelt and artistic. Chhoti Bahu's desire to get her estranged husband's affection and become a mother and her attempts to please him by taking to alcohol only to become a fervent alcoholic herself and remain the same neglected wife, are all aptly displayed. Kumari plays the role with great mastery; her appearances in songs, like \"Piya Aiso Jiya Mein\" in which she dresses for her husband and particularly the seductive \"Na Jao Saiyan...\" are astonishing; her big, expressive and often tearful eyes, her brilliant dialogue delivery, her emotional outbursts, her breaks into anguished and sarcasm laden laughs, and ultimately her nostalgic monologue towards the end, are unforgettable.While Kumari dominates the show utterly, one must not forget the great job done by the rest of the cast members. Guru Dutt, playing the role of the innocent Bhootnath, who later becomes Chooti Bahu's confidant and close friend, acted like only an actor acting in his own film could. Rumour had it that he was actually the one who directed the movie, simply because the movie is identified with his own style of filmmaking. This rumour was disproved by people associated with the film, but Guru Dutt, the actor, still played his role exceedingly well probably due to his involvement with the film as its producer. My most favourite scenes of his are those in which we see Bhootnath as a middle-aged architect. There is a kind of yearning and sadness in his eyes which is real and easy to relate to. Waheeda Rehman played Jaba wonderfully and her character's transformation from an arrogant and careless young lady into a suffering and loving woman was natural and convincing. Rehman, as Chhote Sarkar was restrained and effective.As mentioned, Hemant Kumar's music for the film is great. Shakeel Badayuni wrote fantastic lyrics for the songs, and so every song has a story of its own and comes at the right places fitting the situations. Every song is very much a part of the narration and contributes to the story. Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle were the voices of the ladies, and did a great job. Among my favourite scenes in the movie is the one right after the \"Na Jao Saiyan...\" number in which Chhoti Bahu bursts out at her husband after he criticises her of becoming mad as a result of her heavy drinking, while she turns on him to reproach him for being the only reason because of which she sacrificed her basic values and all just to please him. A frequent quote in the film, that of Chhoti Bahu asserting that she is not like other landowners' wives, being much more devoted and caring, is very memorable, particularly because it's well delivered by the lady. All in all, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is a gem of Hindi films. It is an all-time great movie, and much of it because it has an all-time great performance by Meena Kumari.\n",

            "Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi beautifully recreates the Mohalla Assi in this religious/political satire based the novel Kashi Ka Assi. The neighborhood of Assi itself is the protagonist of this movie. The identity of Assi is not just defined by the fact that it is ghat along the holy river, rather it is the also the people who live in that locality. People participate in daily \"parliamentary discussions\" on the changing society and importance of culture at the only place in Varanasi that has democracy, Pappu's tea shop. The characters in the tea shop look straight out of a satire novel in Hindi. The conversations at this shop tie the whole script together and take the story forward. What makes it worth watching is the context that is set around it. It also tries to depict the impact that major religion- based political events had on the people of the society. The humor is very intelligent and contextual, since it is a satire.The story of the movie was a simple one, where a diligent and honest priest struggles to make ends meet, whereas other half baked gurus dupe the tourists to mint money and lead a comfortable life. It shows how westerners come to the city in search of spirituality and have no clue about what they want. How the city in its own corrupt ways connives to thug them, thereby destroying the moral fabric of it's culture one bit at a time. Ravi Kishan and other supporting characters deliver a wonderful performance as the whole locality revolves around these tourists.Sunny Deol as the righteous priest beautifully projects the perplexities that the character goes through as he comes to term with the practical challenges of life. However, it is Sakshi Tanwar, as his wife, who really delivers a stand out performance, questioning his eccentricities and still standing by him as a pillar of support. Together they go through their struggles, to find a way to live with their values in this world.The film got banned because of the cuss words used in the movie, but as a character says that in the culture of Varanasi, everyone is greeted with \"bhosadi k\" just like they are greeted with \"Har Har Mahadev\".\n",

While the blind boy is looking for his sister, he also is making his friendship with the crippled boy stronger each day.With some mind blowing music that brought out quite possibly Mohd.

Unlike Page3 and Corporate this one walks one the edge of being a serious documentary which is almost realistic and immensely enjoyable. It does make you think how fortunate you are for not being where the characters in the movie are. Having stayed in Mumbai for almost 25 years before moving to the states, I can really appreciate the work that has been put into it. Seeing foreign locales in every second movie that comes offshore (I am sick of it), it is nice relief to see Mumbai (even if it is elaborate stage) at its raw best (or worst?). Excellent acting by everyone but a special mention of Ranbeer Sheorey(I hope I got the name right). You can almost feel the character and feel relieved that it is just a movie. I think this guy deserves stronger roles similar to this. he is by far one of the most talented new faces that has come to Bollywood. I am trying my best to not give away any of the movie because I want people to be hit by it when you see it. To make long story short - you will not feel that you wasted your money if you see this movie in theater or at home. It is much better than many of the movies that you must have seen in recent times. Madhur - take a bow - you have more talent in you than you know - just needs a little bit more polishing and then you on par with any of the Hollywood directors.

The viewers are compelled to admit the follies and bitter treatment meted out to an innocent woman who ultimately resorts to find refuge in the filthy side of the world. By, coincidence, the most respected, wealthy and influential elite of the city also finds solace in the company of this woman. But something is common in both, i.e., they have been rejected from their homes and yearn to find shelter (physical for the poor and psychological for the rich).The song \"Chingari Koi Barhke\" is a classic masterpiece shrouding the excellent screenplay and cinematography coupled with heartrending acting of Rajesh Khanna who has proved that he is a SUPER STAR given his spellbinding screen presence. His brilliant and mesmerizing acting in the boat in a moonlit night speaks volumes about the subtle imagination of the director. The lyrics and music of this song can reverberate the emotions of even an extremely self centered person. Whenever, one watches this song ......one finds something latently vibrant which stirs deep inside the soul. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and Shakti Samantha supercharged the movie with this magically hypnotic song. THIS IS THE HIGH POINT IN Indian MOVIE MAKING. Believe you me, the direction, music, acting and cinematography in this song is very unlikely to be equaled in near future, given the prevailing temporal, crazy, puerile, showy, cheap, vulgar and synthetic direction, acting and main theme of the movies.Some of the very subtle and bitter human values and sentiments creep at the climactic end of the movie underlying the quintessential lesson for mankind to \"do good and earn virtue\".\n",

            "Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty have both acted in many mindless action films during the 90s. Both of them are good action heroes but both of them took time to get noticed and applauded by audiences. Initially, there films weren't anything great, but it those few films like Khiladi(1992), Gopi Kishen(1994) that got them noticed. Waqt Hamara Hai is the first time these two were seen in a movie. However, the film wasn't anything compared to Rajiv Rai's Mohra. With that said, the film was still better than other films like Hum Hain Bemisaal(1994) which was a dud despite some good action sequences. Their combination didn't have great movies but some were worth watching and in the 90s they acted in 4 films together. Waqt Hamara Hai(1993), Mohra(1994), Hum Hain Bemisaal(1994), and Sapoot(1996). From this list, only Hum Hain Bemisaal was a flop at the box office.Waqt Hamara Hai isn't anything novel but it isn't a bad movie for its time. Obviously people from this generation will not like movies like this. However, for a 1993 release, the film isn't bad. I tend to like films from the 90s so this one wasn't a painful watch for me.Waqt Hamara Hai has a simple story and for an action film, the story is predictable and extremely typical. The first half is all 90s college style with Akshay shown as a troublemaker who cheats his parents and gets his pocket money. Sunil is shown as a typical smart student who Akshay likes to bother. After a major fight, both become good friends. Then the film shifts from the initial comedy and romance to action and saving India from a nuclear weapon type thing. This Krypton thing is what the villain wants and he also wants to hunt down the minister of India. Akshay and Sunil with their girlfriends Ayesha and Mamta are the ones who will stop the criminals. While Ayesha and Mamta dance, Akshay and Sunil fight. This is how the rest of the movie goes, and the end is predictable. However, one would not expect the hilarious finale of Akshay cutting Rami Reddy's head of. That scene is stupid, it's like Rami shoots Anupam Kher and makes a run for it on his bike. However, Akshay takes a blade and swings it towards Rami's head. The bike moves and Rami's head falls off. However, Anupam survives because he had something hard to ensure the bullet didn't hit him when it was fired.Direction by Bharat Raghachary is OK, he handles several scenes in both halves well. However, the first half is slow and it is the Krypton twist which gives the film a boost from the initial slow and boring moments. Bharat did a better job with Takkar(1995) a Sunil Shetty film which flopped.Akshay Kumar does what is required of a 90s action hero. He shines in action scenes, his mischief act is hilarious. However, he overdoes the comedy at times. Sunil Shetty makes you smile and ridicule him at the wrong places. His acting wasn't that great and Akshay has an edge over him in this film. In Mohra, Sunil had an edge over Akshay because his acting was much better in that film. Before Gopi Kishan, Sunil wasn't much of a good actor. Even in films like Dilwale(1993), Ajay Devgan was the reason of the film's success. Ayesha Jhulka's pairing with Akshay has clicked quite a lot. Despite acting in flop films like Dil Ki Baazi(1994) and Jai Kishan(1994), they have Khiladi(1992) and this film to their credit. Their chemistry was better in Khiladi though. She looks beautiful but her role is limited. Mamta Kulkarni also looks beautiful but her role lacks the meat. Anumpam Kher is good, he provides us with light hearted comedy scenes. Rami Reddy plays the villain, he does a decent job. The rest provide functional support.Music was good, Haan Ji Haan Maaf Karna was a big hit, other songs like Kami Nahi Hai Ladkiyon Ki Sehar Mein and Kachi Kali Kachnar Ki were good songs but were just like fillers. Action is good, and it is the main plus point of the film. However, the climax has Filmy and stupid action especially the ending when Rami Reddy looses his head. That end scene is unintentionally hilarious.On the whole, Waqt Hamara Hai is a fairly good film with some clichés. The film does drag with comedy and romance in the first half. However, that is forgiven with some good elements like the comedy which is good in the first half.\n",

            "One of Gulzar's finest works (well, in his case every film is one of the finest) is called Koshish. This is a realistic tale of a deaf couple, played to perfection by Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bhaduri. The film shows how handicapped and limited people learn to live life to the fullest despite and against their difficulties and defects. They suffer but they love life and try to see their cup as half full. The film follows their life experiences during a period of 25 years or so, presenting their fears, their love, their ups and downs, and their struggle with the tough reality, always overcoming the obstacles with a smile.Only two hours long, this cinematic piece is thoroughly beautiful and moving. Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bhaduri bring two accomplished performances much ahead of those years, played with impressive simplicity and ease. Kumar leads the show, and Bhaduri provides great support. Dina Pathak is also very compelling as Jaya's mother. The film has several heart-breaking moments, which I won't reveal here. It may seem too dark at points. It is naturally devoid of songs or comedy and is very focused, which makes it a tad too serious, but it's artistic and brilliant and should appeal to any sensitive cine-goer.\n",

            "Aarzoo is an awful film. It is terribly made and more terribly written. The entire idea of the film is one old cliché, and the amateurish dialogues do not really help to elevate its level. The story follows a typical love triangle affected from past incidents (blah blah blah...), and the film takes inspiration from different Hindi films, for instance Sangam. The film stars Akshay Kumar, Madhuri Dixit and Saif Ali Khan, all of whom get let down by the poor and overly melodramatic script. I really wanted to see Kumar and Dixit working together, as they worked before partially in Yash Chopra's bright musical Dil To Pagal Hai and both were good, but here - their romance is unconvincing although it started well at the beginning. I also expected to see Akshay and Saif, who had played brothers or good friends many times in such entertaining films as Yeh Dillagi and Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Ironically there was an action scene in this one in which they fight with some gangsters in a club and you could here the famous tunes of both these films in the background. Anyway, all the actors fail here, though Madhuri does do a good job for the most part. The film's second half is simply unwatchable, and the final sequences are boring, cheesy and ridiculous. Aarzoo means \"Wish\", and I really wish I had not seen this one.\n",

            "At last - I've finally got round to it and managed to see a \"clean\" copy of Pakeezah! Up until now I've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off Dubai TV sometime in the '90's, with quirky English subtitles, dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own. Having thought the world of such a poor (and short) copy I find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought possible.This was the lovely Meena Kumari's film from start to finish, and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on, finally realising it in 1971. What a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards, and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in Pakeezah, necessitating a body double. In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.The story of Purity versus Adversity I can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it, but I'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in India. It's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message, an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too. But to me it's the peerless golden music by Ghulam Mohammed as sung by the incomparable Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding. I've seldom heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack. Singin' In The Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah has my favourite music - yet Lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her. The only pity is that the also unique Mohammed Rafi only had the one song in here, albeit a classic duet with Lata. Because of all this but not blind to its faults, Pakeezah is my favourite Indian movie, filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur. At the very least watch Pakeezah for a taste of what Indian \"pop\" music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines, the Bollywood Beat and bhangra.\n",

It's always interesting to learn about the animation of other countries and this film, apart from being a well known piece of Indian animation is actually part anime as it was literally collaborated on my Japanese animators. It's weird, because I know little about the relationships of those two countries. I know very little about Hinduism, but am always glad to learn something new. This movie features the tale of Prince Rama fighting against the evil Ravana. I know little about the actual Ramayana poem, nor about the Vedas or any of the Hindu holy text in general.The only thing that was familiar to me was the brief mention of chakra, which has been referenced in various anime. Well, it only fits as it is part anime. I think it's great to see a movie that combines two Asian countries. The animation in this film is absolutely gorgeous. You can definitely see some anime influence but it's still unique to the style of India. I love how Rama is actually smart and attacks Ravana while he's regenerating. Granted, he couldn't just do that forever, but he's smarter than most protagonists. I am glad to watch this movie to understand HInduism more.I remember taking a course in religion awhile back, which is probably the most familiar I am with Eastern religion. I think it's great to learn about other cultures. I don't know if I'm offending any Hindus with this review. I just wanted to watch a great movie and that's what I got. The designs are all great. It's hard to really praise the plot or anything because it's based on a classic piece of literature I am not familiar with. I always want to learn about other countries, especially the ones that have over a billion people! ***1/2\n",

            "Getting straight to the point, what makes 'Chaalbaaz' immensely enjoyable is Sridevi. Displaying her comedic skills to the max, she proves again why she's among the best. Dual roles weren't anything new to her and here she plays mirror image twins. There's the tough kickass no nonsense Manju and her (separated at birth) pushover sister Anju who's brutally abused by her maternal Uncle. The story falls on the lines of 'Seeta aur Geeta'. Those were also the days when Sunny Deol was quite likable as an actor that he would do a little more acting than the over the top action sequences. Rajnikunt isn't bad either. Anupam Kher and Rohini Hattangadi are good as the caricature evil Uncle and Aunt. Shakti Kapoor is quite annoying and a young Aftab Shivdasani is unintentionally funny. One ought to keep in mind that 'Chaalbaaz' is a masala entertainer and not to be taken too seriously. On the down side, many of the songs are terrible but there are a few that are worth watching only because of Sridevi's dance and comedy. On the technical side, it's not very impressive as cinematography, sound and lighting is quite poor (which was the case with most 80s commercial Hindi films).However, 'Çhaalbaaz' provides plenty of laugh out loud moments to make it worthwhile and that is due to the divine Sridevi. Thanks to her, this one woman show is worth watching.\n",

            "I had thought I was consciously going from one disaster flick to another, from the latest that Hollywood has to offer, to what Bollywood has on its plate. The trailer would have suggested that it's in line with Hanuedae with copious amounts of flood waters wrecking havoc on the man on the street, but this was actually quite the disastrous picture in itself.It's a romance story, with little time devoted to its gimmicky backdrop with the 2005 Mumbai flooding. Unlike similar plot devices in various disaster films, this one could have done away with its gimmick, but what would remain is an uninspired piece of romantic drama that neither sizzles nor touches, but contains every conceivable cliché offered by any mediocre television drama. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they fight and we find out whether they reconcile under a heavy downpour. Making things worst is that the characters have absolutely no chemistry, and you'd be rooting for them to stay apart since staying together had proved to be difficult.Emraan Hashmi continues to play the artist type as Akshay the painter (he was also a painter in Raaz: the Mystery Continues), who thinks the world of himself and refuses to compromise his art nor to eat the humble pie. He falls for rich girl Sanjana (Soha Ali Khan) and they decide to move in together in a swanky Cape Town apartment. Being without of a regular job, we know who will ultimately be forking out dough for bills, and this damages his big male ego. Multiple fights ensues, they split, and meet again some 6 years later, where the film began, aboard a business class section of the airline. Yep, ego boy finally made good, and is contemplating against his ego how to woo his lady love back, except that this time the heavens so wish to rain on his parade.The narrative gets told in flashbacks, which I thought the backstory would be over and done with by the time the intermission rolls along. Unfortunately not, as it continued to plod on. The story by Ankur Tewari failed to realize how to cut its losses once the appeal of the lovebirds no longer hold, and the focus could have been on how damaging the disaster is, no thanks to inept, lazy and incompetent staff at a meteorological station who seemed more concerned with who's making money from the in-house gambling table. Then again, perhaps the lack of a fat budget had prevented that aspect from taking place,and what resulted in were a couple of CG wide shots of the city drenched, and a couple of archived newsreels to tell you just how bad the situation is.For a set action sequence – check this – we have a bus turning slowly to its side in a manner which defies the laws of physics, just because a tree branch had punctured one of its windows, and it seemed like the end of the world for all on board, who had so far been mulling around just waiting for the rain, and the flood waters to stop and recede, which the latter did so under miraculous circumstances actually. And what about the inexplicable rush of a towering body of water into a building floor which is higher than what the level of water on the streets is currently, just to see capture sheer horror from the faces of our lead characters? And to top if off, some melodramatic moments you see coming from a mile with regards to water, and power cables.For what it's worth, Tum Mile could have been a wonderful comedy, but it decided to focus on the insipid relationship between two uninteresting couples in their tiffs and attempts at reconciliation. The result? A total washout.\n",

            "Suneel and Dharmesh Darshan brothers who came into the film making business with blockbusters like Lootere, Raja Hindustani, Dhadkan, and hits like Jaanwar, Andaaz and a few others. But, Suneel just like his brother ended his career with 2 back to back disasters Mere Jeevan Sathi and Shakalaka Boom Boom. Mere Jeevan Sathi can be put in Darshan's worst romantic film and this one could be his worst action film. Coming to Talash, the film is typical, boring, no good reasons for it to be even an average hit. The film is the typical action which Darshan must have copied from another director because his films are natural and this one feels like a typical delayed 90's film. There is no acutual story to tell, his sister gets kidnapped, his dad dies, his mom becomes insane and he teams up with his cop friend and guide to find his sister, take revenge and kill the enemy? How many times have we seen such typical films. I think the 90s was filled with these typical movies but they had good handling. But, this movie has been badly edited and it looks like it was rushed. The action scenes are done to death and the addition of unusual violence in the climax doesn't impress anyone Darshan. The film is so bad it makes you cringe,though this released before Akki's Hatya which was a disaster, it seems to be even worse. Performances are average, Akshay does OK, Kareena back then was terrible, Ashsish Vidyaharthi is always the typical cop in a Suneel Darshan action movie and his role can be played by anyone because he has the same dialogues, he basically sleepwalks in his role and this role of his makes his role in Mrityudata a classic.

It is only when calm, rational, moral Sunny Deol loses his temper that he emerges as the leader of the three and balances the comic triad.

It offers nothing new in terms of storytelling, but its still fun to watch, as it stays true to the genre & delivers exactly what it promises: Time-Pass Entertainment.'Policegiri' Synopsis: A tough cop comes to a new village to clean the dirt, but faces a mighty opposition in an evil politician. 'Policegiri' is old wine, in a new bottle. Luckily, the film works, because it entertains at most parts. The First-Hour is engaging & very progressive. The Second-Hour, however, loses pace & the war between the good & bad, gets monotonous. Its never boring, but it doesn't engage as much as the First-Hour does. The Adapted Screenplay offers plenty of action, blood & gore, but lacks sharpness in the Second-Hour. Dialogue will be loved by the masses. K. S. Ravikumar's Direction is over-the-top. Cinematography & Editing are standard. Music by Himesh Reshammiya & Meet Bros Anjjan, is good. Action-Sequences are awesome. Performance-Wise: Sanjay Dutt is in form. He enacts the tough cop effortlessly. His Fans will love him, once again! Prachi Desai gets limited scope. Prakash Raj is the same as he was in Wanted & Singham. There's no novelty as far as his character & performance are concerned. Manoj Joshi is efficient. Rajpal Yadav & Rajat Rawail don't raise many laughs. Mukesh Tiwari, Murli Sharma & Raju Mawani are perfect. Om Puri is adequate.On the whole, 'Policegiri' will work strictly for those who love vintage masala films.\n",

The story revolves around what happens when his character Amrit is mistaken for a wealthy man named Mr. Sinha's son in-law. Sinha opposed to his daughter Juhi's marriage to a man named Vijay, and she left home. Years later, when Juhi already had a son, Sinha started missing his daughter and asked her to come back. On her way to visit her father, Juhi's husband is killed in a train accident, and Juhi disappears. The little kid is found alive and Amrit is brought to Sinha's house, mistaken for Vijay. From then on begins a chain of lies, and Amrit cannot reveal his true identity because it could kill Sinha. At that time he falls for Juhi's younger sister Reshmi. But some time later, Juhi is returned home, and she is diagnosed with temporary amnesia. That's the basic story of the movie, and it is an okay 80s fare, which would be enjoyed by lovers of Hindi cinema only. The dialogues, the proceedings and almost everything else in the movie wavers between good and bad. The only thing that is consistent in it is the music. R.D Burman creates another brilliant soundtrack which gives the film a certain charm the script did not manage to give. Songs like \"Jeevan Ke Din\" and \"Kahin Na Jaa\" are classics. Rishi Kapoor is quite good in his leading role. Tina Munim is lovely and hot. Pran is good as usual, so is Amjad Khan, and Sarika is wonderful as Juhi.

            "I generally avoid films about politics, because I find that most of them are stereotypical and one-sided, but this one is directed by Gulzar so it can be nothing but excellent. I followed this belief of mine, and I was not disappointed. Aandhi is not at all a film about politics. Politics is just a part of the story, it's just a profession of a woman in this film, which is used to show her power and to show how a profession of this kind may trouble a woman's personal life. This is a film about love, marriage, romance, human nature, pride, separation, ego, forgiveness and reconciliation (in chronological order).Aandhi is about Aarti, a woman of strong character who has ambitions to become a politician like her dad. She falls for a common hotel manager named JK, and decides to tie the knot with him, much to the displeasure of her father. After marriage, Aarti tries her best to balance between her political work and responsibility as a wife/mother. However, as time goes by JK feels he becomes inferior to her even at home. Differences lead to intense arguments and subsequently to a break up. Many years later they meet again when she is already a big political leader. And a new relationship begins as they reminisce their life together.I was completely engaged by Gulzar's superb direction, his extraordinary story-telling, and his realistic portrayal of human relationships. We see neither bitterness nor anger between Aarti and JK, but only a renewed and mature relationship based on understanding and fond memories. The film is extremely well-written, so are the characters. The story unfolds interestingly through flashbacks and the connection between the past and the present is brilliantly displayed in the film. There is a very impressive attention the director pays to details. Gulzar's dialogues are exceptional, and he writes beautiful lyrics to the songs.Suchitra Sen and Sanjeev Kumar give two powerful performances. Sen is astonishing as Aarti. We see so many sides of her personality, and this difficult role is played with complete ease and precision by this phenomenal actress, including dialogue delivery and body language. This is a performance with a great mix of toughness and vulnerability. Sen displays both coolness and a pinch of arrogance while playing the strong politician, yet convincingly switches it with warmth and cordiality when she becomes a suffering woman or a wife. The ever-great Sanjeev Kumar is (unsurprisingly) nothing short of excellent. This is another outstanding performance this unforgettable actor added to his vast repertoire.The film is both a drama and a romance, and one aspect that significantly contributes to this is RD Bruman's fantastic soundtrack. \"Is Mod Pe Jaate Hain\", \"Tum Aa Gaye Ho\" are wonderful songs, but the one that makes the greatest impact is \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se Joi\", for its melodious tunes, fantastic lyrics, but most importantly for the amazing scenes it carries. I consider the sequences shown through this song the best scenes of the film. They show moments of interaction and painful feelings of missing. These are poignant and memorable moments, and the same can be said about the film itself. Aandhi is a gem. That's it.\n",

Hence, he does not want his younger, and in his eyes, naive brothers to go after women. So, he stops them from any female contact whatsoever. But the inevitable happens, and they fall in love one after the other. What ensues is all sorts of hilarious situations - an enormously funny boxing match (between the eldest and the youngest brother, played brilliantly by Kishore Kumar) where the referee (Anup Kumar playing the middle brother) gets knocked out, crazy detective routines, an out of this world car race and the typical climax - a fight sequence.This movie stands tall amongst the greatest comedies ever, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Singin' in the Rain, Modern Times etc. Shows you that you do not need to get obscene or profane to get laughs! And believe me, this one gives you more laughs than you can handle!!!\n",

            "Some producers like Gowariker (Swades), Bhansali (Black) mature with each film and \"Kisna\" is a fine example of how a producer the caliber of Subhash Ghai sink with each film to the point of decadence. The Story is a figment of fiction in Ghai's mind. Only in his mind do we see \"Lady Catherine\" (when did she get knighted? did I miss this Ceremony?) donating enormous amount of money (like zillions of crores) to charity, still she has some loose change left for the child dancers. Only in his mind do we see Kisna, killing his kith and Kin because he promised his mother that he would get Catherine to Delhi-but I missed the part where his mother told him to sing romantic duets on the way. At one point he says he is saving Catherine from the evil Prince-which one is it? or do we care at this point? Ghai, who is credited for the story and direction, makes a mess of both. The direction is disjointed. The Debutante,. Isha Sherwani, is incredibly co-ordinated (if Ghai, has his way, her Career will be on hold meditating at the end of the rope.) She and Hrithik Roshan would make a great dancing couple in a Musical, if only a good producer could take a hint. Antonia Bernath must have graduated from the \"Aishwarya Rai School of dramatic acting\". She speaks Hindi with a Cockney accent-and this get to be painful and ridiculous after a while. Vivek Oberoi, this guy has no Screen presence for a leading part, he should confine to playing hoodlums in movies like \"Company\". The music is good-specially the last duet is an absolute melody. The Production values are good as in a Ghai Film, but everything else is atrocious.\n",

            "What can I say about Kache Dhage? Have seen it many times. Every viewing enriches the experience except that the suspense in the climax will no longer be there. This film is dominated by its music and the story becomes weak before the music in spite of being good on its own.Songs just fit into the film very well. The haunting music composed by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with the right dose of Punjabi words in the songs is the best thing happened to this film. The image of Punjabi songs, at least for me, was only \"balle balle\" type of songs. However after I discovered the treasure of Punjabi poetry in Nusrat's other compositions, I decided to learn Punjabi one day. The songs of this film are definitely and definitively representatives of the wonderful Punjabi poetry.If I remember what I heard on TV correctly, the music for this film is as such not composed for this film but the film makers took the music of Nusrat and ACKNOWLEDGED/credited Nusrat for his music. This honesty is reflected in every department. Unfortunately, Milan Luthria could not live up to the expectations of people like me with his other offerings Chori Chori and Deewar, given the promise of his talent that was present all over Kache Dhaage. I recommend this film very strongly. God Willing, I would own a DVD of this film soon.\n",

            "Indian filmmakers have been taking inspiration from Hollywood flicks but very few such filmmakers openly admit it. Director Ravi Chopra (son of the legendary film director - late B.R. Chopra) saw a Hollywood movie - The Towering Inferno (1974) and got inspiration for making an Indian movie. He openly admitted this fact also. The Towering Inferno was based on the plot of the fire in a building whereas Ravi Chopra decided to make a movie on an incident of burning of a running train. And he made a brilliant movie whose climax (the train on fire) is simply mesmerizing and by inserting all the regular Bollywood formulae according to the taste of the (Indian) public, he finally served a Masaala flick to the Hindi movie audience.The Burning Train is the story of three childhood buddies - Ashok (Dharmendra), Vinod (Vinod Khanna) and Randhir (Danny Denjongpa). Vinod and Randhir were at loggerheads even in their childhood and the rivalry continues even after their growing-up and becoming employees of the Indian Railways. Ashok has been in love with Seema (Hema Malini) but gets heartbroken when she leaves him due to his losing his wealth and becoming poor and vanishes from his life. Vinod marries the love of his life - Sheetal (Parveen Babi) and gets a kid but his family life is not pleasant because he is not able to give sufficient time to his family due to extreme busyness. Randhir's jealousy towards Vindo has not only carried over since their childhood but it has deepened in adulthood due to Randhir's losing out to Vinod for Sheetal's love also.Why Vinod is not able to devote time towards his family ? Because he has been relentlessly working upon his dream project of making a magnificent train for the Indian Railways. The train is all set for its inaugural run from Delhi to Mumbai when Sheetal finally leaves Vinod's house and highly sad Vinod moves to the control room of the train to take care of the technicalities, sending his friend and colleague Rakesh (Vinod Mehra) to Mumbai by flight to welcome the train there upon arrival. Ashok and Randhir are also on the train due to different reasons. There are different kinds of passengers on the train including a small time thief - Ravi (Jeetendra) and a young girl - Madhu (Neetu Singh) who is escaping from a marriage being forced on her by her family.The drama gets a boost when Ashok comes across Seema in the train and to avoid her, gets down from the train in the middle of the journey only to find Randhir in a bar who tells him that he has kept a time bomb in the engine of the train to sabotage the train and taint the repute of Vinod. Now starts the tussle between the baddie and the heroes to save the train which is set on fire after the explosion and with its brakes also failing, is going to meet its disaster and the death of all its passengers. The prolonged and thrilling climax leads to the happy ending of the movie.The movie has all kinds of regular Bollywood formulae, entertaining the typical Indian movie buffs but its essence is the climax which justifies its title. The climax is pretty long and sensational. It's technically superb and contains several twists and turns, making the final part of the story of the movie a see-saw. It's full of not only action and thrill but also sentiments and music. It containscertain tear-jerking scenes too. Several character artists have got ample opportunity to leave their mark in the final sequence of events.Though Ravi Chopra had got the inspiration for making this movie from The Towering Inferno, by default perhaps, it gives glimpses of the Titanic mishap also (the Hollywood movie - Titanic was made much later than this movie) in which the inaugural journey of the ship fails and that journey contains all kinds of RASAs of literature - romance, sentiments, humour, action, thrill just everything. This way, similarities can easily be seen between The Burning Train and Titanic.The music of R.D. Burman is not great but not bad either. The songs appear good to ears when listened to during the movie. However the Qawwaali - Pal Do Pal Ka Saath Hamaara Pal Do Pal Ke Yaarane Hain is a memorable one both in terms of the lyrics and the melody and also the picturization.The Burning Train boasts of a great star cast, viz. Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Vinod Khanna, Parveen Babi, Jeetendra, Neetu Singh, Vinod Mehra, Danny Dengjongpa, Simi Garewal, Asha Sachdev, Romesh Sharma, Padmini Kapila etc. I give full marks to director Ravi Chopra that he did justice to all the characters and allowed every one of them to leave his / her mark in the story. All of of them have done pretty well though footage awarded to them varies from character to character.All in all, it's a highly entertaining movie with technical excellence which I unconditionally recommend to movie buffs of all categories. I wonder why this movie was commercially unsuccessful despite all the necessary ingredients of success. Perhaps it was ahead of its time. Indian audience did not like such movies those days. However now the taste of the Indian audience has changed a lot and I believe, if B.R. Films decides to re-release it, it will get the love and appreciation of the Indian audience.\n",

He carries this movie really well.Giselli Monteiro - By far the WORST actress alive today. I cannot understand who actually approves her for auditions for movies, her expressions, acting skills are horrible. I hated her in Love Aaj Kal and hated her even more in this one. Her voice was super annoying, she's not as pretty as she thinks she may be. Bottom Line: SHE IS NOT MEANT FOR ACTING!!! AND For some ODD reason she's too damn Overrated!!!Zoa Morani - Total Hot new package in bollywood with great acting skills. I hope she continues to pursue in upcoming movies.Satyajeet Dubey - At first I was like Oh no, but as the movie progresses he totally surprise the heck out of me. His character was really lovable and his personality made it even more lovable. Great acting skills. Hope to see him more.Overall: The movie worth one time watch. Not even close to 3 idiots level.

            "Hate Story 4 created a lot of buzz because of its erotic posters and over 35 million people viewed its trailer. However, the trailer for the film showed mostly erotic content and its storyline seemed to walk on the same path like the previous films of the same franchise.This is the first women-centric film of Urvashi Rautela but she failed to do justice to her role. Urvashi performed wonderfully in bold scenes and dancing moves but other than that she could not manage to give good expressions in the film. The famous tv actor, Karan Wahi has an image of an innocent guy and he is not fitting in his role in the film.The music of the movie is very good which is the specialty of the Hate Story franchise. The new versions of the two old songs \"Aashiq Banaya Aapne\" and \"Naam Hai Tera\" are simply amazing. Other songs are average in terms of their composition.The Director, Vishal Pandya should have tried a different strategy than the same old style like in many erotic thrillers. The film is slow on many occasions for no reason. Vishal Pandya could have made it better in its direction by introducing some unique elements in the film.There is nothing new in the script and also the storyline of the film is very predictable. It's that in spite of 2 men and one woman, this time it is two men and two women. The story could have made more interesting to introduce new twists in the movie.Overall, we can say that it's below average performances by the actors and the concept of the film is similar to other erotic films.

            "Ab Tak Chhappan (2004) is a movie that stands all by itself; it doesn't need a sequel nor can a proper sequel be made out of what was left at the end of the film. So even if this is a daunting effort, the tediousness will bore you.Now, the plot of this much-anticipated sequel is hauntingly similar to its prequel. All-star encounter specialist Sadhu Agashe (Patekar) comes out of retirement and rebuilds his reputation as a maverick. The sidekicks are new, though the attention-seeker that was played by Yashpal Sharma then is now played by Ashutosh Rana in a seemingly absurd role. The same phone conversations with an overseas gangster, collateral damage, raw language, camera work, and Patekar's distinct talking style are all reminiscent of the brilliant movie we adored a decade ago, but twenty minutes later, the narration fails to arrest our senses. Slowly though, the tension picks up, but soon fades away. We end up feeling displeased.Had most of the previous cast brought back, this could have been made into a much better thriller, but given that Agashe is fighting the bureaucracy this time, all is built on stinking stones of predictability. The scattered sequences and bad editing further adds to the damage done to the original film. Moreover, the climax goes slightly overboard, dealing and being priggish about the current state of politics.Patekar is brilliant as always, and he does a splendid work. Rana is wasted and I wonder what Gul Panag as a crime reporter was doing in the film. She barely had a role to play and is only found shouting.BOTTOM LINE: If you loved the 2004 film, you may give it a try, for it is an average thriller. Otherwise, skipping wouldn't be harmful.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity/Vulgarity: Medium\n",

            "Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan were considered a hit team after the superhit Yeh Dillagi(1994) and hit Main Khiladi Tu Anari(1994). However, their next set of films failed to deliver and Tu Chor Main Sipahi(1996)felt like a bad rehash of Main Khiladi Tu Anari with average handling.Tu Chor Main Siphai(1996) is a mediocre action comedy with Akshay as the hard boiled cop and Saif as the buffoonish thief who later masquerades as a cop in a village. The starts of well with Akshay's typical cop act and the scenes with Anupam Kher are funny but over the top. The comedy works well in places but Saif as the King robber is stupid. He dances like an idiot for no reason, he slaps a girl for not knowing how to make food, and he robs like some moron. The film starts going downhill with several stupid comedy scenes but some scenes (Akshay coming to know that his girlfriend Tabu's father is the same commissioner who is troubling him) shine. The second half fails to entertain with Akshay catching Saif and then Saif catching Akshay and getting him out of his way. However, Saif shines as the cop and he is really good in these serious scenes. The village part of the movie provides a so called story which saves the movie from being a terrible cat and mouse movie. The rest is average with good action and silly scenes but the spoof of Deewar is silly but funny.Direction by Guddu Dhanoa is average in parts, he hasn't handled the film properly with some scenes being good while many being over the top and stupid. His Elaan(1994) was much better and this one pales in front of it. Music is okay with no memorable tunes, the songs just distract the movie and the worst part is that none of the songs are chartbusters.Akshay Kumar repeats his Main Khiladi Tu Anari act and does well but it is nothing new for him. He shines in action scenes and his expressions are just fabulous. The only part where he fails is comedy and his Laalu act(same type of act from Sabse Bada Khiladi) is annoying. Akshay was not known for his comic timing before Hera Pheri(2000). Saif Ali Khan is average in comedy scenes and awesome in serious scenes. His scenes as the police officer are good and the scene where he survives the attack from the bandits is well acted by him. Tabu is good in her role but the other actress fails to deliver. Anupam Kher is funny but he overacts terribly in some scenes. Deven Varma is good in his role and his Deewar spoof scene with Anupam Kher is funny.On the whole, Tu Chor Main Sipahi(1996) is a mediocre fare at it's best, it is nowhere to the awesome Main Khiladi Tu Anari(1994). However, this flop film is still better than Keemat(1998) and Aarzoo(1999) which were awful Akshay-Saif films.\n",

And what I loved about it is Paresh Rawal, Ravi Kishan & Vivek Oberoi with his charming style (after Jayantabhai debacle) and Arshad Warsi. Sanjay Dutt imitates Salman Khan of Dabangg and is a total waste. Minnisha Lamba is useless but Divya Dutta is good enough.The script is exponential just like in mathematics and plot points are assumed. There are no proofs for the screen-playing events while the theorem is poorly executed. The lead role-players are like superheroes who can defy gravity anytime & anywhere. Director has wasted all his resources. I think he was in dire need of giving us this crap that he totally lost it. The same dialogs, the same item numbers (there are 2), the same narrow deep cleavages, the same unexposed love-making, same songs for every lead actor and finally, a predictable story... well ZG is not a shocker but it could be considered as one of the disastrous movies of 2013.BOTTOM LINE: Zila Ghaziabad is such a movie, which if not made, would not have made any difference.

There is little evidence of any further imagination on display. The constant references to Yashraj films annoy. The voice work is unremarkable and both Kareena and Saif seem to be essentially reprising their well known off-screen personae. Only Javed Jaffrey leaves an impression as the villain Charlie Anna.

            "DHAAI AKSHAR PREM KE is a hopelessly contrived and overly melodramatic musical romance from Bollywood, yet it deserves attention because of its central performance by the reigning queen of Bollywood, Aishwarya Rai. The beautiful Rai is seen to much better effect in such exemplary romantic spectaculars as HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM, TAAL, and DEVDAS, but she is quite compelling here playing a girl hopelessly in love with a man pining for someone else and ultimately forced, as she is in so many films, to marry a man she doesn't love.A perennial staple of the melodramatic form is the misunderstanding that escalates to a point where it becomes too late to tell the truth and straighten things out. Here a young college girl from a traditional family, Sahiba (Rai), is rescued, first from attackers and then from a suicide attempt, by Karan (Abhishek Bachchan), a young army captain on leave. He takes her home to her family's rural estate and is assumed to be her new husband and welcomed enthusiastically by all the relatives but the girl's angry father, Yogi (Amrish Puri), who had opposed her going away. With each heart-warming ritual and ceremony, Karan becomes more and more a part of the family even though he is in love with a girl back home and eager to get back to her. Gradually, Sahiba grows to love him and eventually tells him so and begs him not to go.To make a long story (167 minutes) short, Karan runs out on Sahiba only to learn that things at home are not what he thought they were. He returns to Sahiba's home to reclaim her, only to find her about to be married to the son of one of Yogi's business partners. Things take a particularly egregious melodramatic turn when two characters resort to some old-fashioned villainy (all that's missing are twirling mustaches), including tying up two of the protagonists to posts in a factory which is then set on fire. Having proved himself a man of action battling terrorists in the film's opening sequence, Karan gets an opportunity to be a two-fisted, pistol-shooting hero again in the film's implausible finale.With the exception of a magnificent ceremonial number performed by Rai and a number of ornately dressed back-up dancers at the film's midway point, the songs are rather simply staged and consist largely of fantasy duets performed by Rai and Bachchan against exotic Indian backdrops and such far-flung locations as Scotland and Switzerland. The abrupt changes in setting (and costume) are rather jarring and tend to break the mood of the film and slow down the narrative.The film remains worth seeing for Rai's moving portrayal of an anguished village girl who is both eager to break out of her traditional family structure yet is clearly nourished and empowered by the strong support she gets from her mother, grandmother, aunts and uncles. Rai's expressive eyes and mouth convey in heart-breaking fashion the gradual buildup of love for the man who rescued her and her anxiety at the prospect of him leaving. Even amidst the outlandish turn of events on display here, Rai proves what a superb film actress she is, expressing a full spectrum of emotions, from joy and contentment to fear and suicidal despair, never once striking a false note.\n",

            "What is it about? The story is a love triangle between Mahinder (Nasseruddin Shah), Sudha (Rekha) and Maya (Anuradha Patel). Mahinder is an ostensibly ordinary photographer. Sudha is his equally ordinary, understated and understanding wife. Maya is Mahinder's sensitive, enigmatic, complex and impetuous ex-girlfriend with an extraordinary gift of poetry. When the film begins one night, we meet two of the three main characters- Mahinder and Sudha in the waiting room of a train station in the middle of nowhere while it rains relentlessly outside. It is immediately apparent to us that these two characters have shared something in the past as there is an unmistakable sense of familiarity and an edgy chemistry between them. Then, through a series of sporadic flashbacks, we are transported to the past where we find some answers to our questions Mahinder was expected to marry his childhood friend Sudha but while he was away from home, he had fallen in love with Maya (titled so aptly as she would later play the 'other woman' and hence symbolizes selfish greed for the protagonist, Mahinder) and Mahinder confides in Sudha that he wants to get married to Maya. Circumstances however act against his wishes and Maya disappears and he, having thought that she had walked out on him (something which is never confirmed in the film), ends up marrying Sudha. However his old house is where the more vivid memories of Maya can be found. Her flavor through the windows and her demons under the carpet; she is omnipresent- in the nooks, crannies, cobweb ridden closets and basements, her memories linger on and she lives on between Mahinder and Sudha like those articles of old furniture one develops a sentimental fixation for and hence, neither is ever discarded. Long gone are the days when he used to revel in his reveries about her but some of the memories still linger on like the rain's aftermath. You know how the tumultuous waves of the capricious oceans return and bring to the shore an unmistakable sense of sweet sad Deja Vu and so, one can almost hear the patter of Maya's feet upon the antediluvian seashore of Mahi and Sudha's house. And the imprints made by the patter of her feet upon the frivolous sand of time and the echoes of which can still be heard in its corridors. They are part of a different dimension where time, space and place were of no consequence and they live on still, in the house of memories, ever so fraught with her undeniable presence It is this state of turmoil that Mahinder finds himself to be in. He has to make a choice. Should he stay on with the sweet reality of Sudha or try to grab the beautiful, mirage like illusion of tempestual, blissful happiness in Maya? He opts for the latter and more self destructive path and then something happens which is not revealed till towards the end of the film Why is it so good? Ijaazat is simple, yet layered, subtle yet profound and overwhelmingly poetic. This is probably the best script/screenplay Gulzar has ever written. Every single dialog between the characters is worthy of interpretation, worthy of quiet listening. It makes you wonder, what was said, what was unsaid, what was implied, what was hidden, what was meant I especially loved the way the characters are written and developed. Its hard not to empathize with all three of them. Everyone has given a brilliant performance. Through simple acts like hanging a towel, combing one's hair, fiddling with a light switch; character motivations are brought forth in a stunningly unique and beautifully subtle way. The dialogs are scattered with poetic verses that are both pleasant and profound. Some examples- Sudha: \"Kya Ghar Abhi Bji Wahi Hain\" Mahinder: \"WAHI Toh Kuch Nahin Raha Par Haan, Hai WAHEEN, Usi Jagah\" & Mahinder: \"Yeh Duniya Bhi Toh Ek Waiting Room Hi Hai\" Ijaazat.A remarkable story of two lovers whose love story was incompleteA movie about love- lost, found and lost again. Poignantly poetic and tremendously metaphoric with allusions of the concept of a Waiting room and the illusions of Maya, Ijaazat has a classic absorbing story, stunning performances, outstanding poetry & beautiful rhythmic music. The passion between Rekha and Naseerudin Shah and between Naseeruddin and Anuradha has been dealt with amazing finesse and sophistication. The songs \" Mera Kuch Saaman\" and 'Katra Katra' are amazing in its rendition and also the perfect embodiments of the situation between the protagonists. Someone rightly said that he film takes off from the moist surreal world of olive branches dripping with Gulzaresque poetry and goes right into the hearts of the characters. The film sees them all- the pure and serene Sudha, an unsolvable cipher like Maya and the tragic Mahinder- through a beautiful albeit maudlin prism. This is a kind of lost love in the true sense of the world. Not only was their love incomplete in the film but more broadly, this movie is also representative of a time bygone, an innocence lost. The heart just doesn't beat anymore nowadays like it used to in the environs of films like these. Back in the days when the pace was slower, the skies bluer, and there was still some magic left in the innocent charms and affairs of the resplendent heart. Ijaazat is an unusual and ingenuous movie in the sense that it sees sophisticated poetry in the most ordinary situations, lives and events. An affair to remember. indeed!\n",

            "This film, called TEEN KANYA in Bengali and TWO DAUGHTERS in English, was made six years after Ray's first film, PATHER PANCHALI (1955), which was the first of the famous APU TRILOGY. Having finished that trilogy as well as another of his haunting masterpieces, THE MUSIC ROOM, Ray turned his attention to two wonderful short stories by Rabindranath Tagore, so that this film is therefore a diptych, composed of two separate films of those two stories. The first of them is entitled THE POSTMASTER, and most of it is filmed in and around a small hut inhabited by a young man who has just become a village postmaster. Along with the hut and the job, he has acquired a servant named Ratan who is a 10 year-old orphan girl who never knew her mother and father. The previous postmaster beat her and treated her badly, but the new one is very kind, and she becomes attached to him. This is the first time she has ever allowed herself to feel anything for anyone, in her harsh young life. The story is one of the saddest and most heart-breaking ever filmed. The intensity of the acting by the young girl, played by Chandana Banerjee, is one of the most powerful child screen performances in the history of world cinema. This young girl only made one other film, KAA, in 1966, and after that, nothing is recorded of her life or her fate. She was able to convey so much with her eyes without speaking, that it was like cinematic telepathy. The ending of this film is unforgettable, and will haunt any sensitive person always. The second film is not a sad story but an odd and amusing one. It concerns a girl in her late teens who is a wildly eccentric tomboy. She and her family live in a shack by the river bank, having lost their home and all their possessions in one of the many floods which continually afflict Bengal (the stories are set in Bengal). She likes to run wild and free, swing from the trees, play with the boys, run and hide in the forest, and always goes barefoot. She is brilliantly played by the young actress Aparna Sen, whose first adult part it was (she had appeared in one film previously as a child). She went on to become one of India's most famous serious film actresses, and has appeared in 62 films, including others by Satyajit Ray such as DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FOREST (1970) and THE MIDDLEMAN (1976). She also appeared in James Ivory's THE GURU (1969) with Michael York and Rita Tushingham, as well as James Ivory's BOMBAY TALKIE (1970) with Felicity Kendal. In this film, Sen evokes the mystery and the animal energy of the wild young creature in an unforgettable portrayal of a girl in rebellion at becoming a woman and a wife and thus forfeiting her freedom. These days the film should be adopted by feminists as a manifesto statement. Satyajit Ray was notable for making many films sympathetic to women, girls, and children, and he had a rare understanding of the vagaries of feminine psychology. His films are often as much psychology lessons as they are high art. And he had the ability to get his actors and actresses to give of their best, and then more besides. Certainly, Ray's films are some of the most emotionally moving and psychologically profound works of cinema ever made. But in addition to that, they are technical masterpieces as well. For this film, Ray was director, producer, writer, and composer of the music. Ray was certainly one of the three great Bengali geniuses of the 20th century, another being Rabindranath Tagore himself, and the third being unquestionably Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, the scientist who collaborated with Albert Einstein, and after whom Bose-Einstein Condensates are named. (But if you have never heard of Bose-Einstein Condensates, you are forgiven, as they are highly technical, and even most physicists have never heard of them.)\n",

            "The basic premise is regardless of love-marriage or arranged marriage, divorce is the final destination for sure as much as death or taxes. Govinda keeps popping-in and out at regular intervals on the screen to prove his point, add fuel to the fire in the lives of couples and keep his chimney burning. The casting is perfect. Govinda reprises Partner Salman Khan. Fardeen & Genelia are well suited for the modern couple while Tushar & Prachi for the traditional. Anupam Kher was wasted. Vikram Gokhale had an extended special appearance. Darshan Jariwala gets in the skin of the character as orthodox patriarch.The songs are just about okay, Pritam should stop using too using too much of English language in a Hindi film. In his second outing Rumi Jaffery attempts a David Dhawan/ Priyadarshan. Having established himself with the credentials of a writer, Rumi seems to have a bit lost when it comes to wielding the megaphone. The basic flaw apparently is the slow screenplay. In addition, a taut job was warranted by the editor. The tongue-in-cheek humour was pretty much coming. It also takes a perfect dash of slapstick to strike a balance for a good comedy, which was missing too (should have taken cue from David Dhawan/ Priyadarshan). Having said that there is better quality of tongue-in-cheek humour on telly, so how do you make a movie stand a notch above? Abbas-Mustan as producers should have kept a tab on the proceeding.\n",

Something very deep inside me has changed after watching this movie, something that is now open, and that is my view on the others, judging someone, for me now, is as simple as understanding love...

            "Vikram Bhatt's 'Creature' is ambitious, but its also flawed & unbelievably predictable. Sure, Bhatt creates a monster that does scare you, but a disappointing romantic-track & lack of drama, spoils the fun. 'Creature' Synopsis: A newly opened lodge in the deep forest of Himachal Pradesh, is haunted by a creature. But, the owner of the resort, decides to take matters in her hands & faces the enemy. 'Creature' begins well, with the opening sequence leaving an impact. The fear of the Creature is nicely build up, but the romantic-track involving the protagonists, is disappointing. Also, there is a lack of drama in the narrative. In short, 'Creature' only works when the Creature appears on-screen. Sadly, there isn't much of the Creature, either.The Screenplay isn't without merit, but adding a dull romantic-track, certainly could've been avoided. Bhatt's Direction is good, as ever. He creates a world of fear most convincingly. But the Screenplay lets him down. Cinematography is fair. Editing could've been crisper. Music by Mithoon is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Bipasha delivers sincerely. Imran Abbas Naqvi needs to groom himself. He's raw. Mukul Dev deserved more footage. Deepraj Rana is alright. Aparnaa Bajpai is decent in a cameo.On the whole, 'Creature' is a watchable fare, at best.\n",

            "Well, another of those crude and pathetic movies of the 1980s which today are sadly often cited as the worst examples for films which stamped this decade as the most terrible period in the history of mainstream Hindi cinema. From Kalu to Kaalia, from an innocent guy to a sophisticated gangster, and there you get another Bachchan hit. A clichéd and done-to-death story, a poor script filled with mindless action scenes and many melodramatic proceedings. It's a pity, considering Bachchan's achievements in the 1970s, when he proved his merit as an excellent actor and a star deserving of the resounding success he attained. Actually, here too Bachchan is not that bad; he is of course let down by the script but he also rises above its weakness in several sequences. It's just the choice of this film itself which disappoints (and he would appear in many movies unworthy of his abilities later in the decade). Where the film manages to provide some fun is, first, in the music. Well, that's to be expected when the one responsible for the soundtrack is R.D Burman. Secondly, the sequences portraying the romantic relationship between Bachchan and the exotic beauty Parveen Babi. These are the only worthy moments in the film, which also include the hilarious (not unintentionally, for a change) scene in which Babi breaks an egg on her own head, thinking this would help her to make an omelet. Babi's presence is one of the few positive aspects in this film. The film also has Asha Parekh, who is quite okay, but at times gets also a bit melodramatic, which is of course not her fault. To sum it up, Kaalia is just another wannabe gangster movie with the most predictable twists and neither Bachchan nor any of its other good points save it from being a cheapo.\n",

I think it's just the times we're living in - movies such as Aashayein fare poorly at the box office because majority of the people neither have the patience nor have the IQ to watch such movies.This is the 3rd movie of John Abraham I have watched after Kabul Express and New York, and he has just continued to show what a tremendous actor he is. Despite his other masala movies, he seems to find an off-beat movie and leaves his mark. Anaitha Nair acted excellently in a role that was very different than her role in Chak De India. She fit greatly in her role of a hospice patient. Supporting cast of Farida Jalal and Girish Karnad filled in their roles well.The little boy Ashwin Chitale's role was mystic and portrayed well. Music was by and large melodious and lyrics were fresh (change to today's bollywood junk).

            "Controversial, graphic, violent, unsettling, disturbing, devastating & disgusting but an underrated cinema nonetheless that dares to explore the darkest side of adult industry, there's no denying that A Serbian Film is destined to upset majority of viewers with its gross, sickening & utterly discomforting subject matter which is exactly its motive but looking beyond its on- screen depiction of every taboo, it's also a pretty bold piece of filmmaking.Set in Serbia, the film tells the story of Milos; a well-past-his-prime porn star who's happily married & has a son but the family is going through financial difficulties. Contacted by one of his former colleagues who has a job offer for him, Milos is introduced to the new director & finally agrees to participate in an \"art film\" only to discover that he's been drafted into making a pedophilia & necrophilia themed snuff film.Brilliantly directed, fairly performed, effectively paced, superbly handling the elements of suspense & featuring many deeply disturbing sequences from start to finish, A Serbian Film is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the easily distressed or even a completely normal human being plus its so-called political allegory is nothing but an excuse to justify the pervertedness depicted here as the only reason why this film exists is to shock the viewers in the name of art.Yet, a story like this needed to surface on the screen not because it has a motive but because it represents a far darker side of world which most people choose to ignore, despite being aware of its existence. On an overall scale, A Serbian Film is an extremely unnerving story about porn industry but is definitely not porn plus it isn't afraid to jump deep into the abyss & bring everything to the surface, which it manages to do in an unflinching manner.Yes it's going to leave you emotionally scarred & No, you don't have to watch it just for the sake of it. Make your mind multiple times before you hit the play button and for those who think they can handle this stuff, just when you'll be thinking that this sadistic experience is finally over & you're almost out of this dark tunnel, the final line just before the end credits will do enough damage to break all hell loose.

The most sensational dance number ever to open a serial killer movie \"Jan Pennechaan Ho\" and the fabulous Glomesh Ganesh in a gold Lame dress, Zorro boys and India's answer to Little Richard kick start GUMNAAM off to a musical start start unmatched in movie history. There even seems to be the wives and aunties of the producers as chorus girls, all out of step in their purple frilly dresses - and Zorro masks. Not even the superb 1955 plaster nightclub decor (made in 1965) or the (laughing bird) Kookaburra sounds (often heard in Tarzan films) clutter this most exuberant of nightclub dance numbers. The lead singer even throws himself on the floor and convulses - all in tune! The \"Anything Goes\" opening of INDIANA JONES TEMPLE OF DOOM can't even match this for 'out of your seat' shocko bizarro, because from then on GUMNAAM busies itself with a literally 'and then there were none' plot. There is a haunted mansion, ghosts and nooses from nowhere. The Mantan Moreland style kitchen hand Mamood, has the other major dance number, a tiki-himialyan Esther Williams inspired heavenly fantasy of meeting dancing virgins atop a spearmint plaster stairway held up with dancing plaster fish. All to tikka tikka boo bongo music Just beyond belief. What about the Two drunk girls who decide to sing about how funny it is to be drunk in a haunted house with a killer on the loose!

'Karzzzzzz' is trashy cinema alright but it's not among the worst to come out this year. Most of it is unintentionally funny and it is just plain silly. Himesh Reshmi is quite bad (but he's not the worst actor around). His wig is quite amusing. His voice is not. He plays the reincarnation of Ravi (played by B-grade actor Dino Morea). Urmila Matondkar makes the best of her one-dimensional Kamini. It's good to see her in a full-fledged villainess role again. If only it were in a better movie. The makeup department does a good job in making the old Kamini look like a plastic beauty with hints of aging compared to the young babe of 1976. I still don't understand why an actress of her calbire would pick such projects. If you're only going to do a film or two per year, might as well pick something worthwhile. Though I can see why she would choose the role as it is an interesting part it's just that the film is too bad for one to take notice of acting. That Shweta Kumar has nice eyes (certainly better looking than Khansika Potwani). The other cast members are forgettable. The abysmal songs deserve to be skipped and that's what I did.

            "Just as the title offers, \"Woh Lamhe\" has many exciting moments to offer. I wouldn't say it's a great film but it should provide a very decent watch to its viewers. Supposedly based on Mahesh Bhatt's relationship with popular actress Parveen Babi, the film shows Babi in a rather negative light through Kangana Ranaut's schizophrenic young actress Sana Azim, and follows her relationship with a young filmmaker named Aditya who she falls in love with (that's supposed to be Mahesh Bhatt). A relationship starting off with a collaboration on a film is followed by a live-in relationship, where the young filmmaker is exposed to Sana's insanity. She is haunted by a woman who warns her that everyone wants to kill her. Quite expectedly, Aditya is presented as a kind-hearted and supportive man.I don't know if this portrayal of Parveen Babi's life is correct, but it is certainly unpleasant for those who have known and liked Babi throughout the years. It is not the first time Bhatt wrote a film with a character based on Parveen. His 1982 masterwork \"Arth\" had a similar character named Kavita played by Smita Patil. While Patel's Kavita was a half-backed role in the film, here we get to see this character as the film's protagonist. But unlike Arth, this film was made a year after Babi's death, so one can never know if the characterisation and the story are completely correct, though we all know that it's just based on this relationship and is not a lifelike depiction of it. Whatever there, the film is very alluring and visually pleasing, although it gets to be a bit disturbing at some points.The film belongs to Kangana Ranaut, who is astonishing as Sana. This is another role showcasing her talent in playing emotionally disturbed characters, and despite her very young age, she handles the rather complex character with great ease and looks beautiful and mature. Shiny Ahuja provides good support but at some scenes annoyingly overacts. The direction is quite good, and the film is enjoyable, interesting and has some fantastic tracks composed by Pritam. Every song has something nostalgically melancholic about it, which makes it memorable and ear-pleasing. Woh Lamhe is definitely worth watching, and not only once.\n",

            "It was clear from the beginning of the series that the story had been fairly carefully mapped out. The early ambiguous characterization of the Taelons became clearer as their motivations were revealed, and the righteous fear of the Resistance was confirmed; such gradual exploration of a complex storyline is one of the best elements of Sci-Fi television (I have no idea what semantic distinction is supposed to exist between \"science fiction\" and \"SciFi\"--fanatics are always inventing new layers of obfuscation to objectify their opinions). Unfortunately, E:FC has suffered from apparently unplanned cast changes: the departures of Kevin Kilner after the first season and Robert Leeshock after the fourth (though both have made brief return appearances) have plainly disrupted the story. The latter disruption has sapped the drama of its narrative drive, unfortunately; Jayne Heitmeyer's Renee was fine as a secondary character, but just doesn't have the stuff to carry the show. The introduction of the Atavus has the feel of last-minute scrambling too. The Taelons were a deft, sophisticated creation of a fascinating mind, while the atavistic hybrid that succeeded them would be more at home in a cheap horror story. If I'm wrong about the ad hoc storytelling, then Gene Roddenberry's bible wasn't as good as I had thought. In either case, the final season of Final Conflict has been a distinct disappointment.\n",

            "Sion Sono's \"Bad Film\" is an exploration of human nature in cultural conflicts. The central themes are racism, homosexuality and violence. The characters are marginal misfits who make mayhem in various neighbourhood of Tokyo. The central dilemma of the high-density Chinese immigrants who are perceived as a threat especially as the 1997 Handover of Hong Kong to China is looming, coupled with the more comically-toned fear of \"Blacks\" for their hypothetically huge penises and ensuing vagina-stretching paranoia for the poor Japanese girls from their \"protecting\" male counterparts.The long movie follows a rather typical gang attacks gang pattern with periods of peace and respite, but despite its shortcomings and simple story, it shines with bouts of beautiful artistic cinematography (especially for the budget and guerilla-style street film-making) and engaging, endearing and strange characters. It also showcases Sono's humour, innovation, eclectic vision and symbolic synthesis.The soul-searching in society's fringe is evident and the sedated pace allows for much reflection. At part life-affirming and at parts looking- glass alarming, this examines the essence of being alive in our melodramatic times.The racist dialogue is consistent with typical bigotry, ignorance and fear anywhere in the world, but there is a well-researched and executed scene where the two warring interpreters discuss the merits and underachievements of China versus Japan in a more didactic and less derogatory way which is extremely effective. The other memorable scenes are the visceral eye-stopping \"Slap Scene\" and the various non-sexual lesbian scenes between the two \"Juliette & Juliette\" of the rival clans. The music and editing work well in most part and the ending brings closure to this epic episode, while not necessarily inducing change like epigenetics.So this movie is no clear masterpiece as Canadian \"Crash (2004)\" did much better (and more subtly) evaluating our remaining racist societal compass, but it certainly pushes the boundaries in a beautiful and thoughtful way. All and all, it is a worthwhile, if at times long, watch. It enviably sits in the same decadent universe as Sion Sono's \"Hazard (2005)\" which takes place in New York, versus the elaborate erotic worlds of \"Strange Circus (2005)\" & \"Guilty of Romance (2011)\" but does not completely achieve greatness like \"Noriko's Dinner Table (2005)\" and \"Cold Fish (2010)\" which are more refined on almost every level.\n",

            "In the 1980s, Amitabh Bachchan starred in several movies, most of which were action films and most of which I personally disliked despite being his fan. Aakhree Raasta is actually one of the better action movies he appeared in at that time mainly because of its well-written script and of course his own presence. The movie does have some typical action scenes and an unrealistic portrayal of corruptness and injustice, but the entire revenge track is entertaining and is interesting to watch. One has to remember that while the movie tries to show substance by portraying one man's pain, it is still a masala movie which in general is not to be taken seriously.This is the story of David, whose young wife was raped by a corrupt politician, committed suicide, and David himself was accused of murdering her and got jailed for 24 years. As he gets freed, he is determined to take revenge on the three men who are responsible for his imprisonment: the rapist, a police inspector, and a doctor, all of whom had testified against him in court. But a young police inspector is there to try to stop him, his name is Vijay, and he is actually his son, who never knew of his real father's existence, being brought up by David's best friend Mahesh.Where melodrama and romance go, the movie is a bit lacking and overdone though it has its moments. I mostly liked the sequences showing the interaction between the old Bachchan, namely David, and Sridevi's Vinita, who plays his son's love interest. There was something moving in it, which showed his humanity and her understanding of his longstanding pain. But the movie mostly works as an action thriller. The way David plans to kill all three of his enemies is fantastically done, and the many scenes of suspense are well handled, creating an entertaining picture for the family.The main reason the film works is without a doubt Amitabh Bachchan's performance. He plays the two characters very differently which makes it difficult to believe that it is actually the same person. The one who gives him full scope to win is the David character. He is totally convincing while playing a fifty plus-year-old man and is likable and moving. Sridevi is very funny as Vinita, though sadly her voice is dubbed (but let it be, the dubbing artist is none other than the great Rekha, and she does it excellently). Anupam Kher also provides some comic relief, and Jaya Pradha does her brief role well.The film's ending is excellent and some of the songs are nice, particularly \"Gori Ka Saajan\". Aakhree Raasta is not a particularly great movie, but it is an enjoyable one, mainly watchable for Bachchan's memorable performance.\n",

            "(Sob Sob Sob)I was DYING to watch. So finally, I watched it last night. And I have never cried so much in a movie. In one word, I would have to say that this movie is BEAUTIFUL! This movie is groundbreaking; this movie has a \"realistic\" look at a gay couple and handles the subject of Aids with sensitivity  which has never been in any Indian movies.Story is simple, Nikhil is diagnosed with Aids and his parents disown him. He goes to his partner (soul mate), Nigel. He is treated like a criminal and is locked in a dirty room for months before the lawyer fights for his rights. He has the freedom to live freely and lead a normal life, like any other person. Now, he has no parents, no job, and no life. Only support he has is of his beautiful caring sister, Anu (Princess), Nigel (Boyfriend), and Sam (Brother In-law). Story doesn't focus how or why Nikhil has Aids. Movie focuses how a family and society reacts to the decease. Nikhil is humiliated, once who used to be a star of the town and now he is an outcast. Movie has more of a documentary touch to it (meaning people speak to the camera about Nikhil). We can all relate to this movie. This movies hits home because, we, once in life has had the perfect life but one day everything changes  everyone you loved is gone This is how I related to the movie. Also, haven't we done something wrong once in our life, that have made are parents embarrassed or mad at us. Don't we all have our soul mates? Don't you have a brother or sister who would do anything for you? Movie is about LIFE! Movie shows courage, strength, and weakness in all characters. This movie is filled with beautiful moments ~ just to mention few: 1- When Nikhil's dad comes to meet him after 2 yrs, Nikhil asks for his dad to tell him, please tell me this is a nightmare and it'll pass.2- When Anu comes with a rakhi to Nikhil and the words \"agle rakhi mei tumsei ..\"  realizing that there might not be another Rakhi for her. 3- When Nikhil and Nigel have a fight and Nigel takes Nikhil to the beachthere are glimpses of the past Nikhil & Nigel hanging out at the beach, which shows a healthy Nikhil but now, Nigel is holding on to NikhilNikhil can highly walk or stand. 4-A mother says to her son, I wish you had died when you were born. 5-When Nikhil dies in Nigel's arms. Sanjay Suri as Nikhil, shows his emotions flawlessly. Sanjay plays the role of a man who is gay and in the closet, a swimming champion, a guy who is so pressured by his dad, an artist, and a weak sad, strong, human being. Juhi Chawla -She adds the smile in the movie. She oozes happiness and hope and courage in the entire screen she is present. She is one of my favorite actresses. She stands by her brother when no one is there for him. Purab Kohli - I personally think, this movie belongs to him completely! He is the best. He is an openly gay man. He portrayed the role of a gay man who is loosing his soul-mate so well, that I had to take a double take as to if this was really happening to him. His eyes expressed more than he even spoke. His smile showed how much he misses his boyfriend. His frustration showed how he is missing having Nikhil by his side now. Like, I said about Sanjay suri, Purab is also an excellent actor  I became his fan right after Supari & Bas Yun Hi. I am looking forward to his future projects. ONIR, the director, writer, producer He is the best! He handled the subject of Aids very well. He showed utmost sensitivity and sincerity to a gay subject line. He showed \"realistic\" issues and realistic characters. I am very much looking forward to any of his future movies. Music by Vivek Philip is so beautiful and moving that any time I hear just the \"la lal lllaaa..\" I get a lump in my throat. Lyrics by Amitabh Verma are so beautifully written and are so relevant. Those words will haunt you After you see this movie, you'll feel like someone very close to you just left you..I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE & CD TO YOU ALL! It's a MUST FOR Everyone! PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AND IT'S MUSIC! WE NEED THESE KINDA MOVIES MADE IN India. I, for one, am very very tired of watching \"masala\" type movies. They are not only annoying but make you feel like an idiot sitting in the theatre watching people cry over meaningless emotionless scenes.I simply LOVED THIS MOVIE and it's very tough to put my thoughts about this movie in words, so I had a tough time writing a review on it. So I hope I did my best to promote this wonderful movie. This movie is not to be MISSED by anyone.

            "Dilip Kumar is Anand, a man who is rushing to the train station to meet his wife and kid. On the way his car breaks down and he has to seek shelter in a dilapidated mansion. There he begins to have memories from a past life and remember and retells his life as Deven an accountant for the rich and cruel Ugra Narayan (Pran). Deven meets the shy village belle Madhumati and a romance grows. But there is past bad blood between Madhumati's father and Ugra Narayan. Ugra Narayan's nefarious plans involve separating the two lovers and the outcome is dire. Deven is devastated until he meets a girl who resembles his Madhumati. Who is she? What role will she play in his life? Will Madhumati and Deven be united in this or a future life? The movies weaves a beautiful tale of the past and the present and has a twist on the reincarnation story.I was never a huge fan of Dilip Kumar but here he is stunning. Exceptionally good looking, understated in both the romance and the sadness but never wooden. Vyjayanthi as Madhumati uses the finger to the lip and wide eyes to convey her innocence and it does work to a certain degree. But in her other personas she is fabulous, and can she dance!! Johnny Walker is kind of annoying, but strangely enough he is the only actor who won an award in this film! Pran is the quintessential villain in the era when a villain was needed in every film. He plays the bad man quite well and with a certain emotional depth - he first invites Deven as a friend but is spurned and you are left to wonder if he and the story could have taken a different trajectory had his offer of friendship been accepted.The direction is superb. Bimal Roy tells the tragic tale of Madhumati in a very matter of fact way that still manages to engage the viewers' emotions - the moody way the mountains are shot with a mist enveloping the tragic lovers, the shadows and light in the forests, the precipice that immediately tells you bad things will happen. Hrishikesh Mukherjee edited the film, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Ritwik Ghatak wrote the story and dialogs - this is an assemblage of talents that delivers the goods in an exceptional way.A discussion on Madhumati is not complete without talk of the songs. Shailendra wrote the lyrics and Salil Chowdhary composed the music. The movie almost begins with that mother of all road songs Suhana Safar Aur ye Mausam Haseen. Then, in a very unusual twist, as it ends there is the start of another number - the haunting Aaja re Pardesi! There is the folksy Daiyya re Daiyya re Chadh Gayo Paapi Bichua (you might laugh at the lyric subtitles - they do not get the point) and the stage number where the scorpion is imagined! Then there are the peppy Dil Tadap Tadap Ke and the Zulmi sang Aankh Ladi, the soulful and sad Toote hue Khwabon Nein. Each song is a gem and the soundtrack is worth buying.This is a fine golden oldie, worth many a repeat watch.\n",

I consider this one to be a masterpiece. \"Jimmy, jimmy - acha acha acha!\" - this song is still remembered throughout the former Soviet Union, though 20 years have passed since the film was #1 in national top. Indeed, Indian producers far outsmarted Walt Disney in silly-story-making, with far lower budget. Who knows what globalization issues will produce in the next few years? If Indians win the movie entertainment market, this film may hold the place of Casablanca. As a matter of fact, both Casablanca and Disco Dancers are full of clichés and national vision of the outer world, so in this point of view Disco Dancer is a masterpiece again.\n",

            "What on earth are these movie-makers thinking?!? Just put in few hot scenes with romantic songs and people will merrily watch the film with their mouths open? Forget about horror, this film glorifies the cheap mentality of Indian film makers. In fact I am the biggest fool to waste my time on these crap films. Horror genre is losing its hold day by day not only in Bollywood but also in Hollywood. I know it is difficult to bring up an entirely original horror story these days, but at least deliver a few scares (even jump scares would do).Here a writer Kabir (Habib Faisal) goes into the wilderness of Jammu to write a novel. No prize for guessing that he stays in a creepy lakeside lodge. The lodge is managed by a single woman Meera (Sapna Pabbi) whose husband Jaidev(Gurmeet Chaudhary) is ill. Soon our writer starts experiencing spooky activities like seeing scary reflections in glass, opening doors, etc. which were more comedy than scary. The wheels wear off even before the ride begins. The suspense and reveal behind the scary events was hilarious. Actually number of times I laughed at the scary moments is more than the number of times I was scared. Not a single moment was scary. By the time we reached the climax ridiculed with pathetic CGI and absurd ho-hums I was least bothered.With forced romance and songs (a few good ones thanks to Arijit Singh), Khamoshiyan is just another horrex film of Bollywood which I should not have bothered to watch. After the horrendous 'Alone' just a few weeks ago, we have another one in the same month. How desperate can these film-makers be? 2015 so far has been really pathetic for Bollywood with horrible duds like 'Tevar', 'Alone','Dolly ki Doli','Hawaizaada' and now 'Khamoshiyan'. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this crap. RATING: [0.5/5]\n",

The acting in Ajooba is like that of most 1990's Indian movie (maybe better). An up-side to this classic is that it stars many well known and good Indian actors such as Amitab Bachan. The one thing that attracted me to the movie was an outstanding setting in a desert; making it relate to the old \"Arabian\" tales such as Aladdin which are recognized world-wide for their adventure, love, and humor. The theme of a betrayed pure good fighting ruthless bad catches my eyes as one of the many beauties of Ajooba. Although it maybe lagging in FX (c'mon, 1991), it is a story, that if understood, catches the hearts and ears of its viewers.\n",

            "Salman Khan started off with a supporting role in a relatively lesser known film called Biwi Ho To Aisi(1988). Khan had a supporting role here and unfortunately, the film did not do much for Khan. This was no big deal as Khan became an overnight sensation with his next release. This was the blockbuster, Maine Pyaar Kiya(1989). Khan's Baaghi(1990) released after Maine Pyar Kiya(1989) and it did good business at the box office. Baaghi tells the story of Saajan Sood, a collegian. His father is a colonel from the Indian Army. His father expects him to be a military official but Saajan has other wishes. Saajan has fallen in love with a girl named Kajal. His parents are shocked when they find out she is Paro, a brothel girl. Saajan has a big argument with his father; he ends up leaving his home. He tries to free his love but the brothel owner, Dhanraj, will not let Paro leave. Will Saajan be able to free his love from Dhanraj's nest? Will Colonel Sood accept a brothel girl as his daughter in law despite the fact that she is helpless and wants to lead a normal life? Will there be a happy ending? To find out, watch Baaghi.Baaghi is not a bad film but it is not anything great. It is nothing more than a typical romantic action film from the 1990s. However, it is one of the more popular, more successful, and better romantic action flicks from the 1990s. The film has a script that has been narrated before. Salman Khan and Javed Siddiqui's script is alright but the film's direction rises above the script. The film's direction ensures that the script was executed properly for the most part.Deepak Shivdasani's direction is decent but it is not anything exemplary. The film is decently handled and it works for its time but sometimes, the melodrama goes way too overboard. For example, Colonel Sood's argument with his son, Saajan, is too overdone. It could have been better directed. However, there are not too many of such overdone scenes which explains why the direction is decent.Salman Khan was quite raw during his initial time in the Hindi Film Industry. However, he has not done a shabby job. He has acted decently but at times, he looks a little uncomfortable with emotions. He improved through time and has given exemplary performances in films like Tere Naam(2003) and the most recent, Bajrangi Bhaijaan(2015). Nagma looks beautiful and has done a much better job here when compared one of her next films, Yalgaar(1992). She brings in the right emotions and is quite restrained in several scenes. Kiran Kumar as Colonel Sood does not have much to do but he is good. He only irritates when he has to shout and scold Salman Khan. Raju Shreshta, Salim Khan Ding-Dong, and Pradeep Singh are funny as Salman's college mates. They do what is required. Shakti Kapoor repeats his villain act but does manage to impress. He has done such roles so many times that he can do this in his sleep. Mohnish Behl is alright. Mac Mohan is wasted in a small role. Beena Banerjee is alright. The rest provide decent support.The film's music by Anand Milind was a major highlight. Ek Chanchal Shok Haseena is a decent song but it is not as good as the awesome, Kaisa Lagta Hai. The song that got Abhijeet famous was Chandni Raat Hai and it was pretty good. Amit Kumar's Tapori was added to the film much later and it became a big success. It was the peppy number which was quite foot tapping for its time.Action by Raam Shetty is realistic without too many weird punches and kicks. The action is even more real because Salman Khan is not shown as an invincible person. He tries to fight in certain scenes but he gets overpowered. He is not shown as someone who can easily take on 5 thugs and this is good because Salman Khan was no Dabangg back then. He was no Sunny Deol, an action hero who the invincible action hero image fits really well. Raam Shetty had kept this well in mind while he choreographed the action sequences of the film. Therefore, Raam Shetty has done a good job.A.Muthu's editing is functional. It is nothing to shout about as the film does drag in certain portions. However, it is no big deal as this was a common problem with Hindi Films in the 1990s. All the other people involved in the making of Baaghi have done a decent job.On the whole, Baaghi is a watchable movie but it is nothing special. It is flawed but decently directed. However, this is not Deepak Shivdasani's best directed film even if it may be one of his more successful films. He has received more praise for successful action films like Bhai(1997). However, it must be said that Baaghi is a better romantic action movie than Shivdasani's Pehchaan(1993) which was deeply flawed and hard to digest.\n",

            "I guess when a director (that too as acclaimed as Tapan Sinha) starts off with a script as strong as this one, the expectations are bound to be high. And to our very good fortune, the end product lives up to its expectations. The story is that of a doctor(Pankaj Kapur....FYI...Ek Doctor Ki Maut means 'Death of a Doctor') who is trying to find a cure for leprosy.The trouble is he works for a Government Hospital, and all the research is being done at his home laboratory. With no one to support him except his wife(Shabana Azmi), he has to fight his way out of the system to get his work noticed.Ultimately when he actually finds out the cure, due to lack of proper facilities, he publishes the paper a bit too late. Some other researcher from another nation had already presented the cure.All through the movie the doctor(played as convincingly as possible by Pankaj Kapur) has to fight the press(who think he is playing a con), his fellow doctors(to try to suppress him and later try to steal his invention) and the bureaucracy and red tap-ism of the system.By the end of the movie one becomes hopelessly frustrated with the system and begins to feel the pain and anguish of the doctor. As the movie ends on a tragic note, one is left to wonder how many other doctors, scientists, inventors of India(or other such corrupt developing nations) have missed out on their chance to fame and glory.Its a movie made from the heart.

By the way in Lagaan and in Awwal Number, the sixer off the last ball is hit by the same batsman ,Aamir Khan .America have been making those MLB based films for ages where the lead guy from a struggling team comes in the end and hits the home run,kisses his girlfriend and goes home , so i guess this was not a bad attempt from Dev Anand..

            "'Keemat' is a typical 90's 'so bad it's funny' films. Director Sameer Malkan tries to cash in on the 'Main Khiladi Tu Anari' success by repeating Akshay and Saif, this time opposite hotties Raveena and Sonali. Over the top comedy, dishum dishum (to those who are unfamiliar with the term, it's the sound that used to happen when people got beaten up in Hindi films), a nice dose of sensuality and ridiculous plot with over the top dramatic moments...it's got them all. Let's get to some of the good stuff. I quite liked the songs. 'De Diya Dil Piya' is a sensual song from Alisha Chinoy's part but Sonu Nigam kind of takes away the sexiness from that number with his too innocent voice. 'Koi Nahi Tere Jaisa' is a ripoff. The other songs are pleasant to the ears but weirdly picturized. Anyway enough with the music. Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan are back in their Anari Khiladi mode, this time with an added touch of Sholay's Jay and Veeru and some homoeroticism. At least people now know that these two will perform striptease to the extent of covering their privates with banana leaves while dancing together on some lake. Raveena Tandon is ravishing, sexy and funny. The (intentionally) funniest scenes were with her and she brings the film slightly to the likable side. Sadly her role is limited. She and Akshay also have a great chemistry as has been evident in few other films too. I wonder why this pair was never chosen for good films. Sensational Sonali Bendre has a smaller role than Ms. Tandon. She certainly looks sizzling but is over the top with acting. Moushumi Chatterjee stands out among the supporting cast in a non-substantial role. Anything else? Nah not really. The 4.5 word summary says it all.\n",

            "Watching Umrika at the VIFF this year has made up for the disastrous Beeba Boys. After getting a lot of critical acclaim in the festival circuits I was very intrigued to watch Umrika, but at the same time I was a little wary that the film might end up being a very indie artsy pseudo intellectual film. But thankful Umrika stayed very faithful to its subject, and showing a very realistic India. Umrika highlighted how poverty is in India,how people struggle to make ends meet, and how parents invest heavily in there children for a better future in a very realistic manner.Umrika's main crux is of how Indians, and especially those of the lower/middle population look up to America as place where lives are made, and how if one makes it to America its a dream come true for a working Indian. Dealt in a very simplistic, but detailed manner, Umrika tugs ones heart strings, and makes people realize how privileged we are. It also must be said that Umrika is film were the main protagonist is not on selfish mission but he is just trying to make his mother happy(like his father) but more on that later.Story wise the film is a about a boy named Udai who in the beginning of the film is leaving for Umrika( aka America) his parents are very proud especially his mom who's dream is coming true, he has young brother named Ramakant who is too young to realize what is going on. Udai's family is a very poor one, and they live off what they make daily. Udai's moms only solace was in the letters he would send from the US, and whenever he would forget to send a letter she would trouble the household. Eventually years pass Rama is in his late teens, and after his father dies in a accident, he finds out while inspecting his fathers belonging that his dad was sending letter on the behalf of his brother. Dumbfounded Rama, starts wondering what happened to his brothers all these years, he then making some excuse to his newly widowed mothers goes to the city to find out the truth of Udai. What happened to Udai, and where he is now forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise the film boasts of many good performances, but Suraj Sharma of Life of Pi fame steals the show the with a great mature and restraint performance. Smitha Tambe leaves a heavy impact in her mother act and Rajesh Tailang is also very good. It was also nice to see Prateik Babbar in special appearance.Umrika doesn't really have any major negatives bogging down the film. But the minor issues I had with the film is that I found the film pretty predictable, whatever twists or surprises the film had I could guess them miles away, so the film lost a bit of its novelty for me.I also found that at times I was missing a emotional connect with the characters, therefore even in the saddest scene I was left dull at times.But all minor blemishes aside the film works for many more reasons. The film is set in 70-80s India, and everything around the setting is pitch perfect. Whether it be the clothes, the dialect, the houses etc everything felt very real and raw. The films screenplay is very engaging, and Umrika is probably one of the most realistic films when it comes to portraying India, in thought, and in setting. And I'd like to highlight that the mother characters,and the way she is towards her children, and family etc is spot on.Overall I have seen many films on similar subjects like Umrika, but this film is a very different take, on the obsession to go to America. I found the film high enjoyable and real, but for the right audience, aka a western audience the film can open there horizons, and enlighten them about a true part of India.3.5/5* or 7/10\n",

            "K. Raghavendra Rao comes up with a comedy with a social message. What I dislike about most of Rao's films is that their execution is poorly done and outdated and their movies seem to be set during the stone ages (not literally) while the story is melodramatic as it can get. 'Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya' is not an exception in most cases except that it's set in a slightly more modern city rather than a retarded village from the 1980s. But, unlike their other films, this one is NOT a lost case because of the actors and the comedy.'Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya' presents relevant themes such as sexism, female emancipation etc. I liked that the story revolved around three wives trying to get a job while their sexist husbands strongly oppose this in fear of losing their manhood. India is modernizing more by each passing year but such things do remain a problem within some parts of the culture. The problem in the film is that things are a over-the-top and the characters aren't very well written. Himesh Reshammiya's music is forgettable.The comedic situations are hilarious (while the dramatic ones are overtly melodramatic) and the actors mostly do a great job. Juhi Chawla and Ketki Dave steal the show with their natural comedic abilities. Asrani is great as the sympathetic film buff boss. Govinda too is likable. He and Juhi are great as the ideal neighbour. I would have liked to see Tabu do more comedy but she's stuck with a serious role of which she does nothing short of a decent job. Even Johnny Lever (whom I find intolerable in almost every other movie) is enjoyable (though his character is hateful). A relative newcomer Isha Koppikar has a refreshing screen presence and holds her own while Chandrachur Singh and Vinay Anand are quite annoying.Thus, to conclude, 'Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya' can be said to be one of the better Rao films simply for it's laugh-out-loud moments thanks mostly to the talented cast (with the exception of some of those mentioned above).\n",

There are even some new additions, for instance Chunkey Pandey(apparently Rajiv Rai intended Jackie Shroff for his role but he turned it down).The music was fabulous, especially Saat samundar.

            "The title \"Ghulam-E-Musthafa\" translates into \"slave of God,\" and this epic study of one man's inner struggle with his violent upbringing versus his devout religious beliefs, is truly something to behold. Musthafa, as a young street orphan, is adopted by a political crime boss, whom the boy calls Abba, or \"father.\" The Muslim youth is trained to be a killer, and grows into a quiet, lonely man who knows little more than killing, and prayer. A volatile mix, and when a chance encounter with a beautiful nightclub dancer awakens human emotion in Musthafa, he is forced to re-think his life, and how Allah expects him to live. When a car bomb, planted by a rival crime family, takes the life of his woman, Musthafa takes it as a sign from God, and sets about changing his ways. But not before a deliriously stylish and violent revenge is carried out on the men who took the life of his beloved. As with many Bollywood films, \"Ghulam-e-Mustapha\" is rich with many different genres. Powerful drama, political espionage, and romance go hand in hand with comedy, brutal violence, and... musical numbers! However don't expect a light, sugar-coated film here; this is some serious stuff indeed, and the few music set pieces are cleverly integrated into the film without sacrificing authenticity; those segments are either nightclub performances or fantasy scenes, and the actors don't break out in song, rather the songs are there as a backdrop. The first portion of the film introduces us to the highly developed characters, and sets up the events to come. the second portion, when Musthafa moves into the home of a proud Hindu family, and the struggle that develops over religious beliefs and customs, is both fitfully funny and profoundly touching, and the final portion features some surprising violence, and a shocking ending that you will never forget. This one will be quite a discovery for fans of great, if obscure cinema, and it's topic of Islam is quite timely now. In fact 'Ghulam' serves as a beautiful example, and sheds light on the most misunderstood religion on Earth, by portraying a deeply sympathetic Muslim male, who has a profound love and respect for the lives of others, regardless of religion. In the tradition of DePalma's \"Scarface,\" \"Ghulam-e-Musthafa\" is an epic tale of violence, power, greed, and redemption.\n",

            "In The Movie Welcome 2 Karachi, The Actors Arshad and Jacky has done a good job but the story of the movie is really NONSENSE. The Movie is exaggerated so much that it should be given 0/10 Marks but due to the hard work of the actors and some good humor, I had to give it 4/10 marks. The Duo goes to the Indian consulate and even a very common guy is carrying a very heavy gun (Even Intelligence officer is not having that type of gun). The movie indirectly wants to say that almost every Pakistani is a criminal and everyone in Karachi is a terrorist. After that a war begins between the consulates of the rival countries. Jacky and Arshad are kidnapped in the movie while walking on the road. A Group of Pathans attack on Arshad for speaking Against Shahid KHAN Afridi (A Pakistani Cricket Superstar). Arshad Tries to steal a pizza but even in the Pizza Box, there are weapons. All These Things try to prove that There is no other thing in Pakistan but Weapons and Pakistanis don't have anything to do but terrorism. Apart from these things, the humor (as already said) was very good and the acting skills of Arshad and Jacky made me to give them a satisfactory marks of 4/10.If the film had a better story and if it had shown some reality about Pakistan and Karachi, the rating would be different. But Good Work by Arshad and Jacky.\n",

            "Bhanshali's much appreciated & popular blockbuster super hit 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' was totally inspired from this under rated film of 83. So I hope I need not say plot or theme of it. Film was neither gr8 nor poor but a well balanced film with refined performances of all three lead players. From the beginning of his career Anil Kapoor has shown his acting talent & here he is in one of the most memorable & lovable credulous character as Prempartap Patialawale(a struggling streetsinger Music Director). The film's first half represents his funny romantic affair with Padmini & I have never seen such a funny kissing scene in any bollywood film as funnily fixed between them on terrace. The character has verisimilitude with Sunil Dutt's golden comedy 'Padosan'. He is nicely co-operated with really praiseworthy child act of Master Raju as his assistant. Padmini Kolhapure has done most of the B genre bollywood potboilers in 80's but here she has seriously kept herself in a bubbly girl next door role & win sympathy for her act. Naseer is simply genius & he is the only mature lead character of the film & has done full justice to his role. The film projected a mature & situational love story without being too melodramatic; very rare in 80's revenge oriented films time. Director Bapu has aptly kept the first half of the film full of funny romantic situations & second half with sensitive & serious situational climax. Really, a well made love story, worth watching once.Ratings-8/10\n",

            "Every now and then you are suddenly hit by a movie that leaves an impression on you. This movie has the potential for the same.If I ever to describe the movie in one word - that would be \"moving\". It indeed moved me. After the movie my only response was silence. I just didn't know how to react. It was an experience - though a very real one. It was as if you are witness to the events and you feel so frustrated that there is nothing you can do about it.I could write about the story of the movie, however a part of the fun in the movie is the way the story unfolds itself. So I better keep mum on that. I would just mention that the story is set in Rawalpindi area of Pakistan and its the story about a mother and a son living there. Though its not a social statement, it touches upon the issues of religion, partition, coexistence, terrorism besides being an emotional and philosophical drama.On the movie making, I think its a brilliantly written script. A dialogue that I still remember from the film is when the mother says - \"If the son is not mine then who in the world is.\" It is a painful acceptance of the solitude and the loneliness of each and everyone of us.The acting is almost perfect. In fact it seems that there are no actors in the movie. Its as if real people are living those lives. I wonder how the director found such actors. Kiron Kher, in her central role as the mother, has outperformed herself. Her silence is so expressive, that she doesn't need any dialogues.On the whole I think the movie deserves great credit. I am terribly disappointed at the (current) 6.8 rating at IMDb. I realize that its a non-populist movie but I would have felt that anybody who ended up seeing the movie would be affected by it. As for me, I give it a perfect 10.\n",

The second half goes on and on, with the Paresh Rawal lookalike thrown in, there are several stupid scenes like Bobby blasting an ambulance with a remote control.etcDirection by DD is good Music is okayBobby Deol tries hard to get into a comic role, he is quite good though he overdoes at times Bipasha Basu is okay, Shilpa Shetty doesn't have much to do Shekhar Suman and his 6-7 different get ups do get overbearing but he does have his moments Paresh Rawal is decent but does annoy at times, his lookalike was not required.

            "Sorry bhai is the testimony to the fact that Bollywood is moving forward and the new crop of directors on the right track. The performances have all been wonderful. Sharman Joshi is developing as a good actor and if he chooses his films wisely he can one day become one of the best. Sanjay Suri proves that he is the best from among all model turned actors. The chemistry between Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi is better than what is between most actors and actresses today. They both look a very good pair on screen. Chitrangadha Singh is not only a good actress but is one of the most beautiful ladies of Bollywood and she proves that one can look sensual and hot without shedding clothes. Sharman Joshi has a tinge of comedy in his acting which is only going to help him achieve greatness.Now about the story and direction. The story is fresh and is shot beautifully. The family relations - between brothers, mother and son, father and son, husband and wife - have been portrayed excellently. There is not an instance in the film where you will get bored. A very good script supported by some really good performances makes Sorry Bhai a real good movie. A must watch.This year has given us some really good 'not so commercial' movies and Sorry Bhai can be said to be the top runners among them.It breaks my heart to see films like Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and other crappy movies like those getting nominated and winning awards just because they are made by a known director and are under a big banner whereas some really good movies and performances like this one just sits and watch. Its high time we have an Oscar like award for Bollywood movies where awards are given to performances, characters and not people who are influential.\n",

            "Here it comes again--Emraan Hashmi with chart-topping music, an interesting story, and of course the kiss. You'd think you've had enough, but this power-packed combination never ceases to entertain. The strength is basically in the story. Emraan gets lucky every time. Surprising though that no Bhatts are involved. I could've sworn this was a Bhatt film. Anyways, I must start out with the music, which is definitely the highlight of the movie. It is absolutely excellent and the best soundtrack of 2006 so far. Dino suddenly makes a comeback with 3-4 movies within a month after disappearing for like 3-4 years. He returns as a much improved actor. He suits his role of a serious, chivalrous man, as oppose to the wacky guy in Aksar's remix music videos. His acting has improved since his first (and last memorable) film, Raaz. Udita has also improved very significantly from her last film, Zeher. Emraan's his regular self. Cinematography is good. Ending is a bit disturbing but interesting nonetheless.\n",

            "Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear is an artistic though slightly simplistic work. I did not really like the film being in English but obviously it wouldn't have been possible in Hindi or Bengali, considering it's about a Shakespearean actor. The story is interesting, and the idea of taking an old, Shakespearean theatre actor (Bachchan) and casting him in a motion picture is intelligent. Not less impressive is that despite the film being entirely about Bachchan, all the other characters are well-written. Every character is portrayed as a struggling person. In his way to become a film actor, we meet several characters through Bachchan's Harry: his co-star, Shabnam (Zinta), a model-turned-actress who does not know how to act and what to do with her film career, and who has problems with her jealous husband; Siddharth (Rampal), an arrogant independent filmmaker; Vandana (Shah), Bachchan's mistress (double-meaning); and his confused nurse, played by Divya Dutta. I think the film was well written, although it does become a bit slow at times. Harry's character is wonderful - an artist who insists to work on his own artistic terms. I liked Bachchan's scenes, I liked the scenes of the three women who have a nice evening on the day of the film's release, I liked the scenes of Bachchan and Zinta together, their conversations about what acting is.Bachchan is extraordinary - one of his finest and most difficult performances ever. He is intense, generous, impulsive, and his English line delivery is spectacular. The film belongs to him completely, although the rest of the cast do a good job. Preity Zinta is extremely vulnerable as Shabnam. She lets go of her bubbly, vivacious image completely, and is portrayed as a very conflicted woman throughout. Although she gives a fine performance, I don't find it up to the level of her work in her commercial films - I generally prefer her in roles of vibrant and strong women who are full of life. Anyway, I liked the scenes in which she smoke anxiously, I liked the scene in which Bachchan teaches her how to release tensions by screaming, and she breaks down (this scene has appeared several times in different films), and she was particularly impressive in the film's last scene. Shefali Shah turns in a brilliant, exceptional performance, not that I expected any less from her. Arjun Rampal and Divya Dutta are very good as well. I knew from the very beginning that this film would not work for the wide audience, it's a film for people who like artistic films and festival stuff. This is not a particularly entertaining film, but I enjoyed it mainly due to Bachchan's performance.\n",

            "Vishal Pandya's Wajah Tum Ho starts off as a crime thriller, sporadically turns into a song and dance fest and in the end tries to be a suspense story with further twists and turns. With so many confused aspirations, the film becomes a garish hotchpotch. All shortcomings of a film can be forgiven if it manages to entertain. But Wajah Tum Ho's just isn't able to cut it on that front. Even the songs Pal pal dilke paas, Mahi ve and Aise na mujhe tum dekho are cheap knock-offs. The movie offers generous helpings of eye candy but little wajah (reason) for recommendation. I would advice everyone not to spend cash especially during Demonetization in India. I give 1.5/5 for this insane mystery thriller.\n",

            "I had seen this movie as a kid, but all I remembered was the climax scene, because it was so powerful. I saw it recently and enjoyed every moment of it.The story is set in colonial India, when the British have disarmed the people, and continue to oppress villagers, through tax collectors called \"subedars\". These subedars in turn lust for more than the tax. The movie is about one such subedar, who while on his routine tax-collecting tour to a small village, gets attracted to one of the women. The woman, Sonbai, is married, but her husband has just left for the city in search of a better job. Sonbai(played excellently by Smita Patil) refuses to give in, and while escaping the subedars men, takes shelter in a spices factory.The gate-keeper refuses to allow the subedars men in, and is determined to protect the honour of Sonbai. Here the cowardice of the fellow villagers surfaces, who decide that it is better to give in to the demands of the subedar, than to face his wrath. The movie successfully conveys the cowardice of oppressed men who cannot even think of rebellion, and even beat up their wives when they protest against their decision.A brilliant film.\n",

            "Prakash Jha's Dil Kya Kare is overall an interesting and moving dramatic feature. The film starts with some rather twisted proceedings and works as a semi-thriller. It is later when it efficiently turns into a serious drama dealing with the complexity of marriage, relationships and family values, provoking different moral thoughts from its viewers. Dil Kya Kare is made quite convincingly, and the narrative style is generally very good, though as expected from Prakash Jha, he mixes the usual Hindi film ingredients with realistic situations. The film does tend to drag at points, mainly because some of its sub-plots and attempts at comedy are redundant distractions from the main issue. It is of course Jha's effective portrayal of the characters, their trials and tribulations, their conflicts and their ultimate obligation to solve their dilemmas and take crucial decisions, that elevates it to an altogether higher level.The acting is definitely one of the reasons Dil Kya Kare remains steadily believable and riveting. Ajay Devgan is very good in a controlled performance as a man torn between his wife and his past lover, unable to choose one. Kajol delivers another excellent and heartbreaking performance in a role that is contrary to her own image of an assertive, headstrong and vibrant girl. As Nandita, she is unusually inhibited and subdued and plays the role with subtlety, sincerity and depth that make the viewers really sympathise with her character. Mahima Chaudhry is the complete opposite of Kajol here, but hers is perhaps the most impressive performance in the film. She is terrific in an impulsive, unrestrained and compelling portrayal of a woman who is defied by her own insecurity and fear of losing her family. Chandrachur Singh is given very little scope to make an impact and he is okay.Dil Kya Kare wavers between a thought-provoking drama and a typical tearjerker, but it is effective enough and is generally engaging and touching. The music is also very well composed by Jatin-Lalit. The title song and \"Do Dilon Ki\" are my favourite songs - very melancholic and melodious. Towards the end, the movie becomes very intense and as mentioned, the climax may certainly extract different moral views from the audience. The ending is really poignant and sad, but it brings the film to its much-awaited solution, which is not perfect but it is probably the way most people would want it to be. Lovers of Hindi family dramas will most certainly love this movie. I recommend you to watch Dil Kya Kare, mainly for its innovative story and convincing performances from the main cast. It is not flawless, but it is a worthy picture nonetheless.\n",

            "A very funny movie. All politics aside, fob, abcd, Indian Ameican, these are obviously hot bed issues that stike a chord in each viewer making it impossible for them to watch the movie in its on immensely well crafted, fun, colorful, and musical environment. Practically ten minutes of this film is a man splashing around in a tub, not being Indian, or American but simply being a grown hairy man getting as much fun out of a tub full of water and not taking sides in the epic battle between the new and old groups of Indians ( it would seem from reading some of the pathetic reviews in this collection of reviews the the battle is epic) It seems that this was a topic the filmmakers probably did not think would be so emotional.But once again so much of this movie doesn't really even play into that debate and really just attempts to create some fun and silly moments, like Kal's dance for Janvi. When its does take a stand and get on its soapbox it does it in such a clever way that the Shalllow Indians, who feel the film pokes fun at them, watch the movie don't even notice the scene where PRYIA in JANVI's documentary, reveal the filmmakers true feelings about the whole \"Can Indians get along debate.\" In this scene it seems like PRYIA really does have a mind and she realizes that the struggle Indians have now is nothing compared to the Civil Rights Struggle in the US only 40 some years ago --she admits, and the filmmakers through her, that the battle for who is the coolest is not important when one thinks of the struggles of minorities in this country in the past and all the people who have cleared the way for \"PRYIA\" to worry about how she may be seen as a freak for the color of her eye-shadow and not the color of her skin. It also shows that some of the worst hatred in minority groups exist within the group itself as those who adapt and adopt the culture of the new environment immediately pick on members of their own group who do not fit in. But these are heavy issues and to attempt them in a comedy is bold and i think the filmmakers succeed in showing how this happens and DO NOT TAKE THE SIDE of the person who picks on members of his/her own group, --that is why the club owner is, in the end, exposed as THE BAD GUY. In fact --he is really the only bad guy in the movie. the guy who owns the club and throws the parties but does not want any \"real\" Indians to show up is the one everyone can agree is the \"loser.\" But when it is not smartly dealing with these heavy topics , the film is a very silly and funny movie that cracked me up.\n",

            "It's a rare occasion when Bollywood decides to junk those six pack, rock solid abs, and that shapely hour glass, proportional figure, from its leading characters, with superstars idolized by millions cast as lovers and setting the stage for an incredible love story, for something that's more grounded to earth. Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is that love story about middle aged singles finding each other serendipitously, and falling in love in the process. Without much fan fare, without incredible trips to far flung reaches of the world. Just in and around your neighbourhood, when you least expected.Boman Irani is probably best known by most for his role as the principal in 3 Idiots, and he's arguably just about being one of the best character actors in Bollywood, despite having to usually play someone's dad in his movies because he's middle age. Here he reclaims the leading role as Farhad, the singleton who's way past mid life, and constantly being egged on by those in the family, either with love or being mocked at, to get hitched. It's just that he doesn't have much luck at the romantic front, and his job as a salesman / consultant at Tem Tem's Bra and Panties Shop, doesn't endear him to the opposite sex who are looking for a partner with a more glamorous job to boast about.But his honesty is just about that primary trait he exudes, coupled with that filial piety that's overlooked, with Daisy Irani and Shammi playing his mother and grandmother respectively, almost always threatening to steal the show with their comical timing and personifying the loveliness in a zany household, ribbing Farhad for this single ways, yet eager that he soon finds a soulmate after failed attempts at variations in matchmaking. But the expanded household sometimes got in the way especially with its rather feeble attempts at jokes, such as an Uncle's probable Alzheimer's induced infatuation with Indira Ghandhi, that may be cute in the beginning, but got a little bit tired when it stayed past its welcome in the narrative.Still, the revelation here is Farah Khan. Yes, THE Farah Khan, who had masterfully choreographed item numbers in countless of Indian films, as well as turning into a filmmaker, being in the director's chair for films such as Main Hoon Na, Om Shanti Om and Tees Maar Khan, the latter which I enjoyed even if it got ravaged by most. She goes in front of the camera as the spinster Shirin, who got amused by her first encounter with Farhad at the Tem Tem shop, before as the story would have it, like Romeo and Juliet, become his only love sprung from whom he should have hated, being responsible for ordering the demolition of an illegal water tank that Farhad's dad had installed in his family home. This sets up for the perennial war between the would be daughter-in-law with her potential mother-in-law, if the blessings to get married do come.Being the rookie actress, her rawness does get noticed, but somehow this was somewhat refreshing, rather than the countless of flawless performances put in by the Bollywood idols that put them too high up on the pedestal. Director Bela Bhansali Sehgal had worked the chemistry and pairing between Boman Irani and Farah Khan to wonders, and their starring opposite each other in many courtship scenes, while expected in its development, turned out as what would be best thing about the movie. Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is as simple as it can get in storytelling terms, with the director applying uncomplicated techniques that won't distract the audience, and sometimes, plain vanilla is something that works best, even when the thin story tried its best to stretch itself toward the two hour mark. For a Bollywood film, the songs here didn't quite stick after the end credit rolled, and while Farah Khan does show a knack for dance (for sure, right?), Boman Irani did look a little bit awkward here when required to perform.And for all the singles out there, with paunch, belly and all, perhaps this romantic comedy will provide that glimmer of hope that all is not lost. It addresses the constant pressures one may get from well meaning family members, even drawing upon real world scenarios such as the protection of one's clan or turf through population numbers, without which some heritage would be lost. Or addressing the habit of judging someone at face value, or profession, and drawing all sorts of conclusions from it. A lingerie salesman you say? I'm sure some would jump at the opportunity without hesitation!\n",

And when we see the movie, it seems to be having no soul with only a good body with branded clothes. Its like a Mannequin, stylishly dressed, standing in the show-window but having no soul, no life in it.That's how we should describe Mission Istaanbul. Few months back, same was the case with \"CASH\" & \"TASHAN\". Director Apporva Lakhia has made films which are always good in parts and are shot brilliantly, but they lack in the scripting department.In MI also there are only stunts shot lavishly and too many action sequences without any base in the script. The movie revolves around a very thin plot line of a News Agency / Channel which is also the headquarters of the Terrorists activities. And one hero goes out to set them straight with the help of another.The entire star cast acts as they are featuring in a great action trend setter movie, but i bet they themselves must have guessed after the preview that it was all going to be a disaster.There is simply nothing to talk about or discuss as a reviewer. The film lacks in most of its departments from scripting stage to the acting. Its just a time pass action flick and that too for the smaller centers. At times these kind of movies make you think that how much resources, efforts and hard work goes in vain when the makers come up with such final products having excellent body but with no life in it.Its time our filmmakers should move ahead and stop wasting resources on mindless action flicks.

It crafts a morally dodgy portrait of the 'godmother' of Nagpada, Dawood Ibrahim's tough-minded sibling who ran the dreaded mafia don's crime syndicate by proxy in the 1990s and the nineties without ever being brought to book. It falls off the deep end in the process. Shraddha Kapoor, for whom this is meant to be a career-altering outing, bites off more than she can chew. When she delivers her vapid lines, it is hard to tell whether she is biting or chewing. Seeking to convey menace and power via a darkened skin tone, puffed-up cheeks and prosthetic enhancements around her jaw, she hisses and growls to no effect, making rather heavy weather of carrying the flimsy film on her shoulders.\n",

            "First of all, this is among my dad's favorite movies, Amitabh and Mahmood being his favorites. I, being a late 90s guy, didn't have much thrill to watch this one considering it's way too old. However, I gave it a try after convinced by dad. The story and the comedy kept me entertained from the first minute. Never have I ever enjoyed an old Bollywood movie the way I enjoyed this one. The role of the female actress was exceptional. It remembered me an era of of our culture where women were used to remain in the houses given the mentality of everyone (not only men) those days unlike the feminism evolving these days. They didn't have much freedom, which was very sad. However, I believe, men are not to be blamed for that act. I feel both should be given equal priorities and right although I see feminism evolving at a greater pace these days. Coming back to the story, many movies have some moments which keep audience entertained. In this one, i noticed lots and lots of moments that took place. Kishore Kumar was wonderful! He made the story take pace and give it meaning. Most of the comedy movies we watch do not concentrate much on the story part, but only comedy. This one has both. A great great story. After that, the comedy that is added with those lots of moments most of them involving the ride and Mahmood were awe-inspiring. Mahmood was sensational, so was Amitabh. These days you won't see such slim actors, but stunning six-pack, broad-chested, highly muscular bodies. However, I'm sure you do compromise for Acting. As the movie takes pace, the comedy and entertainment mounts. and you see more of Mahmood and Amitabh. With stunning comedy and adventure, the movie has a terrific climax too. In short, the movie is a complete package of fun and adventure. The Best: The bus Ride! The Worst: Shatrughn Sinha\n",

            "Gurinder Chadha, in the setting of England and with people of Indian background, has made an excellent movie about racism, sexism and the difference in viewpoints among generations. It is applicable to all people. Using the device of a group of \"Asian Women\" going from Birmingham to Blackpool for a one-day holiday, she includes stories about wife beating, unmarried pregnancy, loneliness, religious and cultural conservatism, and the most basic: sexual attraction. One of the most striking things about the movie, other than the intensity of the stories, is that no time is wasted. Despite the rather large number of characters, all are adequately described, and the stories are completely told. There is not one moment in the movie that I would modify. It is excellent: four stars out of four. I am looking forward to more movies and stories from Ms. Chadha.\n",

            "\"A graffiti writer doesn't expect to get caught, like a cop never expects to get shot\". That's one of many phrases to live by for a group of graffiti artists, or \"bombers\", in Brooklyn. BOMB THE SYSTEM, which I knew next to nothing about going in, is a heady, energetic film about a particular subculture. Can't say I really care all that much about how graffiti gets where it gets or those responsible, but I can't deny how well made the movie is. The hip-hop music, an old-school mix by El P (whoever), the editing style, the bleached out color palate -- every storytelling device at Director Adam Bhala Lough's disposal is perfectly suited, if just a tad overused, to the material. We're in good hands, here.Blest (Mark Webber, hardly recognizable from the lifeless STORYTELLING) has bombed since he can remember. Since his brother died doing the same. Jacking spraypaint cans -- because a true artist never pays -- running from the law, leaving his mark on the sides of buildings and trucks, his sights set on the Brooklyn Bridge one of these days. He and his gang hang out, smoke pot, get drunk and appreciate \"the colors, the blends and the smell of paint\". These guys keep regular day jobs, the majority of them anyway, and do their thing at night, maintaining rivalries over territory with other gangs, searching for that one spot nobody has touched and that'll bring them a little slice of immortality. Blest understands his scene. \"If I'm gonna risk going to jail, it's gonna be for bombin' and nothing else,\" he explains to his girlfriend, a fellow writer named Alex (the cute as hell Jaclyn DeSantis). And, it's not like he doesn't have options in life: Alex offers an open invitation for Blest to join her and go cross country; his own crew is asking him to step up and take more initiative right where he is, and he has just been accepted to an art institute. Added to which, maybe he's ready to give it all up for good; \"our pieces keep gettin' buffed as soon as we paint them\". Graffiti is temporary. After a while, what's the point?BOMB THE SYSTEM is kind of sketchy from a plot standpoint (it's got that beat of everyday life, so nothing really happens), and it has more of a political agenda than the desire to tell a story, per se. But, I love the philosophising in Lough's screenplay; his dialogue is very urban, profane and also quite literate. I love the way these guys talk to one another. A corrupt police officer tracking Blest and his gang's activity has a particularly objective way of thinking: he doesn't have a problem with prostitution but doesn't want to see them walking the street, either. Same deal with graffiti. If art is what you are doing, do it at home. Want the services of a hooker, call an 800 number and have one come to your home. Discretion is key. While that doesn't make the cop a fully realized character, it's nice to hear someone with an opinion express it clearly. Which is pretty much the case with this entire cast. Noone gets the proper developmental treatment, but at least they have ideas.The movie doesn't have a beating heart beneath its shiny surface, but what a surface. I hope Lough learns the beauty of the sustained shot; he's too smart not to. SYSTEM is overly busy for its own visual good, at times. An inventive exercise in style. Tone poetry, if you will.\n",

            "This is a perfect example of Indian pop cinema from the 1960's reflecting the relentless encroachment of Western style music and beat generation dancing - however R. D. Burman composed some good tunes for this, perfectly showcasing the talents that were Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi.A woman is murdered and her old friend played by Shammi Kapoor feels obliged to help track down the culprit. As it goes it's done pretty well, but of course the music is the thing! Although I liked his older brother Raj and along with this one some of his other films too I could never understand Shammi's over-expressive style of acting or his appeal (not being a woman maybe) - imho he almost ruined some of the songs here with his mugging and jerky movements. But of course, Shammi once seen never forgotten! Favourite bit: O Mere Sona - I used to wind on and play the vid just for this just to marvel in the incredible dexterity of Asha's vocals in the asking of Shammi's forgiveness; it's much easier with the DVD! The only copy I've ever seen has a rather fluid colour, occasionally lending an unintentionally surreal atmosphere at times but not detracting from the enjoyment.It's an inconsequential treat much better than Viva Las Vegas, but clocking in at nearly 3 hours means patience, patience I think ultimately rewarded.\n",

            "\"People don't like warring with words\" crowed a film magazine from 1985. This assertion gave me the impression that the movie would be replete with verbal wars between the contesting advocates in the court. However when I rented the movie to verify the claim, it had a little legal war, and that too was a bit stereotypical. The movie, however, had its other rewards to offer. A simple, no-nonsense plot about the woes of the family of a wrongly executed man, this film for the most part matches the reaction to the action with minimal overacting. The culminating scene wherein Anil Kapoor, apart from rescuing his mother, gives vent to his pent up feelings of righteous anguish and indignation against the vile acts of Amreesh Puri due to which he had to lead all his life in bitterness -- physical and mental -- is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. In this emotional tirade, we the viewers, have emotions exactly like a person would have, who has been victimised thus. This sympathy of emotions is the biggest achievement of this film. The music of the film is more than just good, specially the theme song, \"Zindagi har qadam ik nai jang hai..\" which is yet another spellbinding creation of Laxmikant- payarelal duo.\n",

ACP Ashwini Dixit starts his searching for the murderer. Meanwhile, lot's of complexities happen in his life or you can say in his mind. The answer of Who is the murderer becomes really tricky and complex due to lot's of twists and turns.The snowy mountains have been shown superbly. Kudos to the cinematographer for using the beautiful place as a haunted one. Similarly, the background score gives you a feeling like these incidents are happening in front of you. My favorite piece of music was when Ashwini enters in happening market in night. Sharib Hashmi plays the role of sub-inspector. He is good. Mandira as ACP's wife is average. May be another actress can be able to pull the role better. Raima suits in her role perfectly. Kay Kay Menon is the reason I went for. He is absolutely fantastic as usual. I am sure you will connect to him from the very first frame. He has done a fabulous job. Also, I liked the setup of the conversations between husband and wife with the usage of poems and ghazals.This film is watchable for the performance by Kay Kay and the complexity created by director Kushal. He, as a debutante, is superb. Though, I find the plot similar to a Bollywood movie (I will not write the name, else you will get the theme of this film if you have seen that) starring Rajiv Khandelwal. That is the reason why I am reducing the rating. But, having said that, the situations created in this one are far different and more fast-paced. You can surely feel the thrill during the runtime. On the whole, this film is definitely worth a watch. But, I guess, it won't make money, because the 2 big Ps are coming next week. Anyway, if you have time, go for it.\n",

            "No way is it near the levels of the Indiana Jones trilogy. 'Naksha' does take its source from numerous Hollywood films, including 'Indiana Jones'. That doesn't really work in favour of the film. Yes, there are a few good moments (stress on the word few). I think this movie had potential to be great (given the concept) and since adventurous films are scarce in Bollywood, 'Naksha' is sort of fresh. Now if only, the director had actually done a better job. The film moves at an uneven pace Technically the film is quite poor. Since it takes place in the jungle, a lot could have been done with the forest atmosphere and mystery to make the jungle more involved but its hardly put to use at all. The cinematography could have been a lot better. The split-screen was annoying and irrelevant and don't even get me started on the slow motion especially in the action scenes (which I fast forwarded). The action scenes were over the top and too long (which is expected in a film starring Sunny Deol). The special effects are of poor quality. Some of the songs are likable and of foot-tapping quality. I liked the chemistry between Deol and Oberoi. Vivek Oberoi does well for the most parts. However, in his introductory scene, Vivek comes across as whiny and Sunny is over the top in most scenes (as usual). Sameera Reddy tries to pull off a Preity Zinta and adds some glamour. She doesn't have much to do but she does beat up an item girl. Jackie Shroff is irritating. 'Naksha' is a wasted effort. It could have been great if the screenplay were tighter (and a whole lot modified). Editing would have helped. The writing could use a lot of improvement. For example, either leave out Sameera Reddy's character or develop the character and make her somewhat relevant. Involve the jungle. Tone down the fight sequences. Come up with something original.\n",

            "Bose, a movie, an understatement that lingers starkly loud in the memory space. The brilliance of Benegal matches with the effortless éclat of some of the best names in the Indian movie industry to create this classic of sorts. Looking back at the attempts of Indian directors at recreating the lives and contributions of the few men that remain unforgotten in the Indian freedom struggle, this depiction of one of the most influential yet neglected heroes of those times, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, stands apart for its simplicity and eye for detail and proximity with historical facts. A few movies that I can think of in this league would be The Legend of Bhagat Singh by Santoshi, Sardar by Ketan Mehta(a master piece, which I don't know why everyone seems to have forgotten), and of course Gandhi. Looking back, also at all these works makes me feel all these have been the best efforts of the respective directors. So is Bose Benegal's best work? Well I would agree that it is his most elaborate, ambitious work till date, and I am least interested in comparing his other works, because all his movies are so original and distinct in their genres, like Zubeidaa, Sooraj Ka Saatva Ghoda or may be Sardari Begum, for that matter. Bose works, and works magically, at various conscious and sub-conscious levels. It is a decent and honest attempt at depicting a forgotten phase in Indian history without even the slightest pinch of controversy or contempt, amidst the mist of Quit India and Gandhi, a phase no less substantial. It invokes a respect for the great work and ideals the man stood for, and still continues to inspire many generations alive and those yet to come. Another feat of the movie is the slick narrative and editing that holds the entire length of the movie with effortless flow. Khedekar is highly impressive, with his distinctive style of natural acting without any pretense or desperate attempts at imitating Netaji. But at the same time, he succeeds at the same with a surprising sensibility and spontaneity. A special mention for the mellifluous score by Rahman, which magnifies the grandeur and gives an identity to the plot. Take a bow, Benegal, Rahman and Khedekar! This one's for every Indian at heart!\n",

            "Firangi is directed by Rajiv Dhingra, who has a couple of Punjabi films behind him. This is his first foray into Hindi-language cinema. Of course, language is no barrier for him. The raw material is. And so is the treatment. He just doesn't seem to be able to decide if his film is an out-and-out comedy, a satirical take on the impact of the Raj on common Indians, or a romance that blooms across an intractable ideological divide. Firangi might have been harmless fun if only it had stopped short of running so hopelessly amok.The trouble with this mildly engaging film, with a solid supporting cast, is that it is far too long. Sharma is serviceable as a young Punjabi munda, making eyes at a blushing Sargi (Dutta). The setting, meant to be the 1920s, is all created on set, but you do initially manage to ignore the carefully crafted mud huts, because the language spoken is real, the gidda is homespun; as are the costumes.But it goes on and on. And on. Post interval, it slows down and begins to grate, even when the in-awe-of-the-'firangi'-hero comes to his own proud 'desi' roots. One thing's clear. With his second outing in the movies, Kapil Sharma wants to desperately drive home a point that he has no interest in milking his comic talent in the movies. While it's a ballsy move for a successful comedian to explore other genres, the question is, are his fans ready for it and can he do it convincingly? Not really, when he wears one expression (lack of interest) on his face, throughout the film. On the whole, due to its weak script and lack of comedy FIRANGI fails to leave a lasting impression. Besides this, the long run time of 161 mins will leave the audiences impatient and restless. At the box office, the film will face an uphill task of enticing the audiences, given the lack of buzz surrounding the film.\n",

            "At least Aetbaar didn't involve a love triangle. I was getting sick of seeing Bollywood films with love triangles. On the downside, there is a love story as the focus, there is a lot of overblown melodrama here, there are songs as travelogues, and a bunch of other Bollywood clichés are present. Aetbaar is also strongly derivative. It's basically an uncredited remake of James Foley's 1996 film Fear, with healthy doses of the Martin Scorsese version of Cape Fear (1991) thrown in for good measure. But if it has to be derivative, those aren't two bad films to be derivative of. The more Bollywood thrillers and horror films the better in my view.Aetbaar is told primarily from the point of view of Ria Malhotra (Bipasha Basu). She's a college student \"waiting for the right guy to come along\". She says she'll know him when she meets him. She meets him (although she doesn't think so at the time) when he, Aryan Trivedi (John Abraham), almost runs his motorcycle into her. They run into each other again later, at a disco. Aryan keeps coming on strong, and Ria falls for him. Little does she know at the time that Aryan has an extremely obsessive, violent side and basically runs his own gang. We see the violent side early on when Aryan heads out to a whorehouse for a little extracurricular activity, and his idea of a good time is assaulting his host instead of making love to her. Ironically, Ria's father, Ranveer (Amitabh Bachchan), is a well-respected surgeon who ends up treating Aryan's victim. Ranveer suspects that something is off with Aryan as soon as he meets him, and his pleas, then demands, that Ria cease seeing him begin to grow stronger. Eventually, he uncovers some \"dirty secrets\" about him. Meanwhile, Aryan's behavior begins growing more threatening. Anyone who has seen a number of thrillers will probably be able to predict a lot of the plot from this point, and of course, anyone who has seen either Fear or Cape Fear will be able to predict it in a fair amount of detail.But insofar as Vikram Bhatt focuses on creating a suspenseful thriller, Aetbaar usually works. Of course Abraham is no De Niro, but he's psychotic enough in his own way. Some of the later scenes, especially those in the climax, can suffer slightly from pushing the envelope towards ridiculousness--for example, at one point, characters do the classic U.S. action film move of outrunning a fireball, but on the other hand, the less bombastic violent material works extremely well.The sets and locations in the film are attractive and suit the material well. The Malhotras' getaway home was particularly effective and the landscape was impressive cinematographically. Of course, the same sort of bucolic but atmospheric setting was used in Cape Fear, but that makes it no less successful here.Problems arise on two fronts. The more serious flaw is that Bhatt directs his cast to horrendously overact. The melodrama couldn't be thicker. There are a few attempts at comic relief, but those are just as painful. Bachchan, in particular, makes you want to cringe when he lays on the syrup, and his English \"hip youth\" spiel towards the beginning of the film is not only cheesy, but for some reason he's almost shouting with a bizarre, affected phrasing. That's a very minor moment, but such groan-worthy tangents are littered throughout the film. I wish Bollywood directors would more often stress underplaying a role. With that type of acting instead, Aetbaar could have nearly been a gem.The other flaw arrives with Bhatt bowing to various Bollywood conventions. Ria has to fall for Aryan for the film to work, but to conform to the standard Bollywood ebb and flow, Bhatt has Aryan strangling Ria one moment, and the next moment they'll be singing a travelogue romance song to each other--you'd half expect them to get married in the next scene while Johnny Lever shows up to tell a few jokes. The build up from Aryan as love interest to Aryan as dangerous psycho needs to be gradual, and once he does something like strangle Ria, she needs to approach him with a bit more skepticism, even if she still gullibly loves him and has a bit of provisional trust in him.There are also some very odd production design elements. For some reason, Ranveer has a piano on his patio, uncovered. Pianos aren't weatherproof normally. Maybe in the film, this one is supposed to be, but it's weird enough that it distracted me. Or, Aryan is supposed to be an artist. He's done some portraits of Ria. The first one he shows her is actually quite scary looking--she seems to be melting, as if it were an \"acid portrait\"; nevertheless, she's impressed, as if it were a normal painting. Again, these are minor points, but there are many of them over the course of the film, and in the general context, they are kinks in the flow of the thriller.There are also a few dangling threads; these should have been better developed. For example, Ranveer never does find out who beat up the prostitute, even though there's a great chase scene where he comes very close. It's just dropped after that. But that's also a backhanded compliment. It should have been better developed because the idea was very good. Bhatt, who also wrote the story, had no shortage of good ideas in his details, and he can create a lot of suspense when he wants to, even if the basics were cribbed from other films.Aetbaar is nowhere near a perfect thriller, or a perfect Bollywood film. But it is well worth a look, and if you're more sympathetic to the typical Bollywood melodrama mode and other clichés, you just might love it.\n",

            "Very few movies have been made in bollywood upon the life of the Christians in India. I consider Julie (1975) and Bada Din (1998) as classics in this context. Today I am reviewing a movie which portrays the life of middle class working Christians in India (Mumbai being the backdrop of the story) with utmost sincerity. In fact, the middle strata of the Indian society contains people from all communities and religions without any discrimination on religious ground. They problems are almost the same. Their issues are almost the same. Their pains and pleasures are almost the same.Baaton Baaton Mein (1979) is a story of middle class working Christians directed by none other than Basu Chatterjee, the director who earned a name in the seventies and early eighties for making low-budget, simple, yet touching movies whose characters belong to the Indian middle class, neither living in slums, nor living in palaces (just a metaphor). Since we belong to that class only, we can easily relate to the stories told by him through his movies whose characters appear to us like ourselves only.Baaton Baaton Mein (through the talks only) has a story set in Mumbai (then Bombay). Tony (Amol Palekar) and Nancy (Tina Munim) happen to get introduced in local train while going to their respective workplaces. Nancy's uncle Tom (David) helps them coming close to each other because he is aware of the pain in Nancy's heart because of a broken affair with Peter (Dev Mukherjee) and hopes that Tony's friendship will prove to be a healer for Nancy. Tony and Nancy start liking each other very much but both of them have a problematic member in his / her family. And they are the mothers. Nancy's mother (Pearl Padamsee) is so concerned with her marriage to a reasonable (earning wise) boy that she jumps to the matrimonial issues every now and then with childish enthusiasm. On the other hand, Tony's mother (Piloo J. Wadia) is over-possessive with her son and wants him to live his life like a dependent child, doing everything by asking her only. Due to these peculiar females, how intricacies develop in the relationship of Tony and Nancy and how they are able to finally tie the sacred knot forms the remaining part of the story which is a pleasure to watch.Baaton Baaton Mein is a movie which does not loses its track even for a second. Right from the beginning to the very end, it keeps its focus on the main story without any undue digression. The narrative is very interesting, close to the real lives of the working people in metro cities and touching, of course. The script-writer has maintained the curiosity factor quite proficiently throughout the movie and the twist in the tale leading the story to its climax is very impressive. In between the story, some songs (total four) appear but they do not block its flow. Instead they support it and being excellent, they prove to be the cherry on the delicious cake.The complete milieu of the movie is authentic. Sets are simple and sober. The scenes in the local trains as well as near the sea shore add to the natural flare of the movie. Editing is also quite good. The complete narrative is a smooth sailing with every emotion suitably placed at the perfect point.Performances are good. Except for some over the top ones (even they also do not look bad), the acting performances of the cast are natural. The favourite actor of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee - Amol Palekar has delivered a brilliant performance. In fact, such middle class person's roles were tailor-made for him. Tina Munim was never a very good actress but the able director has made her act too. She looks quite beautiful also. Among others, the performances of Pearl Padamsee and Ranjit Chowdhury (Nancy's brother - Sabby) are just lovable.Music of this movie is memorable. It contains only four songs three of which are duets and one is Kishore Kumar's solo. I mention the solo song first which is very good and one of Kishore Da's underrated songs - Kahan Tak Ye Mann Ko Andhere Chhalenge, Udaasi Bhare Din Kabhi To Dhalenge. The other three are - the title song (Suniye . . .. Kahiye . . . ) sung by Kishore and Asha, Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuchh Kaha (Asha and Amit Kumar) and Uthein Sab Ke Kadam Dekho Rum Pum Pum Aji Aise Geet Gaaya Karo (Lata, Amit Kumar and Pearl Padamsee). Every song composed by Rajesh Roshan is a gem. The beautiful lyrics have been penned by Yogesh and Amit Khanna. Any music lover can listen to these songs again and again without getting bored or tired.Baaton Baaton Mein is not a great movie but it is a simple and lovable movie which has enormous repeat value.

            "Well it's plain and simple, Rekha does not only deliver one of the best performances of her career, but one of the best performances ever seen on the Indian screen. Rakesh Roshan's direction deserves a special mention. He successfully remakes the Australian mini-series \"Return to Eden\" into a feature film. I liked the portrayal of a modern, urban India. The story is very interesting, though it's much more engaging in the second half. Rekha plays the role of Aarti, a rich, unattractive widow with two kids who gets married to a man who deviously befriends her children and who wants nothing but her money. The rather shocking scene in which she is supposedly killed by her husband is followed by Aarti's transformation from a gentle, innocent woman to a decisive lady who will do anything to take revenge on all those who made her life miserable and separated her from her children. And she comes back to her city in the form of a to-die-for, extremely beautiful model named Jyoti. From then on her true journey begins.This story seems to be a bit unrealistic when you first read it, but the film's proceedings are well displayed, and the story develops at a fast, steady pace. The film has it all: drama, thriller, action, but it is just a very good film as a film and works as complete entertainment no matter what genre it belongs to. Of course there are some unnecessary scenes of comedy here and there, but they are not that significant. The film is made on relatively high production values: the editing is good, the cinematography is effective, the sets are well chosen, the costumes are fantastic, and the film is a very atypical commercial Hindi film of the 1980s in its overall feel. Rajesh Roshan's music is memorable. \"Jeene Ke Bahaane Lakhon Hain\" is wonderfully sung by Asha Bhosle, \"Main Haseen Ghazab Ki\" presents the film's topmost dance-musical performances, but the film's ultimate, trademark tune is \"Hanste Hanste\", which, in its three different versions, is a pleasure to listen to and probably best associated with the film.Easily one of the finest actresses of India, and probably the country's most charismatic star, Rekha is exceptional in this author-backed role. Her portrayal is simply indescribable, with facial expressions, body language and dialogue delivery spot on all through. She carries every scene naturally and makes the almost fantastical transformation from Aarti to Jyoti incredibly convincing. As the more traditional and simple Aarti in the initial portions of the film she is unrecognisable, displaying the right amounts of confusion, simplicity and modesty. But it's the new Aarti (naming herself Jyoti) who gives her full scope to become a winner. She is not only stunning, but acts with impressive confidence and sincerity, delicately letting the viewer sense the pain of a deeply hurt deceived woman, the struggle of a tormented mother, and the steadfast determination of a decisive avenger. This is an unforgettable bravura performance.Other than the show-owner Rekha, the entire cast is very good, with Sonu Walia standing out. She is fabulous as Nandini and acts with aplomb throughout the film. It's sad that such a talented actress did not have the opportunity to make something of her career. She reminds me of today's Sushmita Sen. Two beauty pageants, beautiful, sexy and classy women, and two extremely underrated actresses. Kabir Bedi is excellent as the bad guy Sanjay. He plays the part so well that there seems to be nothing easier than to hate him. The kids are great and very convincing. Sulabha Deshpande in the small part of Leela is outstanding as she always is, and Shatrughan Sinha provides good support in his significant guest appearance.The film has many great moments which manage to tug at the heartstrings. My favourite scene is when the kids dedicate a song to their \"dead\" mother on their parents day at school, while she is sitting in the audience. The first time Jyoti appears on-screen comes across as quite a surprise, and it gives the film a great boost. Another moving moment is when the boy meets Aarti and notices the similarity between \"this woman\" and his own mother but the absence of the birthmark on her face disproves him. Same with the scenes where the dog recognizes Aarti and runs towards her, or the family's mute ranch employee. The last scene is extremely touching. The second half is overall full of great moments which is exactly what fans of Hindi films love. And to sum it up, if you have not watched Khoon Bhari Maang yet, I highly recommend you to do so. It is a fantastic dramatic thriller with an all-time great performance by Rekha.\n",

            "Slow-moving Cold War cheapo without the courage of its convictions. In '48 the Chinese Civil War was in full swing-- red Mao vs. nationalist Chiang, with an outcome still in doubt. The Soviets half-heartedly supported the rebel Mao while the US supplied the nationalists. With the Cold War heating up across Europe and Asia, Hollywood began celebrating government agencies in what many saw as a first line of defense against communist penetration. Here, it's the State Department getting the cosmetic treatment. Note, for example, the celebratory prologue.The impressively handsome Lundigan plays a Foreign Service officer sent to China to assist a besieged legation. There, while romancing colleague Bruce, he experiences the brutal machinations of a warlord (Loo) who's playing both warring sides against the middle. In short, the material implies a larger scale drama than what it receives from this indie production. At the same time, the script plays it safe, never once mentioning communists or Mao. Instead, they're referred to as rebels in the North, while the US maintains diplomatic ties with the government in the South. In short, the screenplay tries to clumsily finesse a critical issue of the day, while we read between the lines. As other reviewers point out, there's much too much talk dominating the latter half, most of it within the cheap confines of warlord Loo's trailer! The gab adds up to a downer despite the fiery upshot. On a similar note, Lundigan's spiffy gray suit remains unblemished no matter the grimy surroundings-- no doubt a concession to the Service's image. Too bad director Newfield adds nothing to the pedestrian script. Some atmosphere would have helpedOn the other hand, crowded scenes of the Chinese town are well done and fairly persuasive, even though the production never leaves greater LA (Iverson Ranch, and the studio). And what a neat burst of inspiration to couple the Chinese fire-eater with the American bubble-gum chewer. In my book, it may be the movie's highlight, an amusing pairing of East and West. At the same time, chubby little Michel just about steals the show from the stiffed-up adults.All in all, the 87-minutes unfortunately adds up to a bigger bite than the meagre budget could chew.\n",

The idea 3 losers turning into robin hoods is pleasing, plus a don who's addicted to soap show and TV stars is hilarious. The film is a decent attempt, and the débutant director has handled the script in full command, he has written it as well. In a nutshell, 'C Kkompany' is a highly entertaining film. Performances: Mithunda is lovable as Datto Bhai. Tusshar Kapoor delivers a sincere performance. Anupam Kher is excellent. Rajpal Yadav is fantastic, especially in the scene where he's drunk and he confronts outside a bar. Raima Sen looks decent, and does a passable job. Dilip Prabhawalkar is good.

            "Mainstream Bollywood movies suck for sure. But this low budget comedy- drama taking on the ever-increasing prices of daily commodities in India, specifically Haryana is a must-watch.Sanjai Mishra as the lead is amazing with him being a breadwinner of a middle-class family. His wife runs a salon while his brother is in love with a grocery-shop owner's daughter. The plot moves up as the family takes a loan under the disguise of opening a grocery store. Things fall apart when the loan inspector arrives. Now, what they do of the money & how they tackle the mounting consequences is a wonderful comic show & I enjoyed it.The message that shoots up is essential & with all its glory of cinema- watching, I rate it 7/10.BOTTOM LINE: Go for it, because it has good cast, good humor, good story & a wonderful message - food for thought!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "I watched the film a few years ago again, after having initially watched it when it released, as a kid. The production values are pretty bad and the film looks dated even for 1990-1991 when it hit the screens. Compared to their other blockbuster Dil, which released around the same time, Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit look disinterested in this one. Madhuri's make-up doesn't help either.Oh yes, the plot. Aamir is obsessed with Madhuri and gets away with his madness only because he is the hero of the film (?) Really? Thisis how stalkers are born. Despite her rejecting him several times, the hero does not give up to the point that it is annoying and you almost want him arrested (even though he is in the film at one point if I recall correctly).Ranjeeta made an appearance and so did Khushboo. Performance wise, both leads try but aren't above ordinary really.So why 5 stars if the film is this bad? Only because some of the songs by Anand-Milind and Sameer are really good! Listen to Main Sehra baandh ke or the title track or even Khadi Rahi or Hum Tumse Mohabbat and you might just agree with me.\n",

            "This is a highly entertaining historical film that had the great misfortune to be released during the height of Schwarzenegger/Van Damme/\"Lethal Weapon\" era. It is a film about cultures in collision and the people who are crushed by that collision.Pierce Brosnan, in one of his best roles, plays Captain Savage, an honorable British soldier in India who is dissatisfied with the \"do nothing\" policies of his superiors. One day, he and his fiancée see a gathering on a riverbank. They learn that a young woman is preparing to burn herself alive in the authentic practice of \"suttee\"...her husband has been missing for a year and custom demands she immolate herself. Savage's girl is horrified and begs for him to think of a way out. He disguises himself as a native man and hopes the widow will see a brief glimpse of him and believe it is her husband. The suttee can thus be postponed. The scheme works, but a mob then chases Savage to ask why he has not appeared earlier. He frantically avoids the mob, but then sees a horrible sight. A band of wealthy Hindu travelers is suddenly strangled, robbed and buried. Savage has seen the secret cult of Thuggee at work! He appeals to the base commander (also the father of his intended) to apprehend the Thugs but bureaucracy prevents him from doing so. Savage becomes obsessed with uncovering the Thugs and hits upon a scheme where he will \"go native\" and infiltrate the Thugs himself. That way he can get incontrovertible proof of their existence. He enlists the reluctant help of a captured Thug (superbly played by Saeed Jaffrey) and goes undercover.Savage finds himself immersed in the strange and deadly world of the Thugs. As time goes by, he is forced to participate in the ritual murders to keep his cover. His identity is starting to give way. Will his sanity last long enough to reveal the secrets of \"The Deceivers\"? There's a huge amount of tension in the movie. Its attention to historical and cultural detail is excellent. Doing some research on the Thugs, I discovered the exact words of their \"Sugar of Kali\" ritual are used in the movie. Most confusing for Savage is the fact that, when not killing innocents, the Thugs appear to be normal and even kind people. The interesting contrast is that the former Thug feels his own loyalty to his people weakening as he sees Savage losing his way.The ending is bittersweet and not sugarcoated at all. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes tense historical drama as well as those who want a glimpse inside a forbidden, exotic culture.\n",

            "Eyes, as humans are we really gifted to be bestowed with them? Or do they blind us and stop us from listening to our heart? Are they a boon or bane? Raj Kapoor takes these questions and weaves a love story to illustrate the point.The human mind cannot bear too much of truth and precisely on this premise Shashi Kapoor's character Rajiv is based upon. He is unable to see the beauty beyond the skin and fails to see the truth. Raj Kapoor juxtaposes the same logic and toys with the audience. Ample innocent skin show is thrown in for the eyes to feast upon. However does the audience look beyond and see the underlying sublime message? Or suffer from the same predicament as Rajiv. The message has been told since time immemorial. With \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" Raj Kapoor makes his sincere attempt.Zeenat Aman:: As always with Raj Kapoor's films, the female characters get fleshed out in greater prominence and hence tend to steal the thunder against the male counter-part. Zeenat Aman gets a role of her lifetime and perhaps might now be thanking her stars for having got an golden opportunity to work with Raj Kapoor. Her character is called \"Rupa\" which is aptly chosen.The rest of the star cast lend adequate support.The music and lyrics have always been forte of RK Films and \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" is no exception. Raj Kapoor manages to extract the best out of Laxmikant-Pyarelal to delivery a rich, soulful and haunting melodies. The lyrics by Pandit Narendra Sharma carry a deep meaning. Lata Mangeshkar renders the songs in top form, as always for Raj Kapoor.The movie was a commercial failure when it was released. It was the time action films ruled the roost. The film was certainly well ahead of its times. The audience lacked the maturity and sensibility to grasp the underlying message. Nonetheless, \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" is a best masterpiece created by the greatest showman of Indian Cinema.\n",

It proved that you do not need unlimited money and unaffordable stars to make a hit film. Sometimes all you need is some savings, a good script, supportive friends and a good amount of passion.Nagesh, it seems left his job in US, came back to Hyderabad and made this small budget movie. Not expecting any great returns, he sold this film to DD which showed it in three parts on DD3 and that is when I caught it the first time. I didn't even know that it was a movie and I just started watching it. It was as if someone like me was trying to say something and on his own terms. Found it very charming and made sure that I watched the next 2 parts as well. I think the feedback must have been encouraging so it was released in theater's on a small scale so watched it again and liked it again. Word of mouth spread and it caught on so watched again with some friends and liked it again.

            "I really, really loved this movie. It was a simple and heartfelt story about a good, caring and simple man who tries to take care of his sister and gets into a load of trouble along the way.I found the story very moving, and the performances, in my opinion, were all very good. Madhavan shines in the lead role (he plays strong, sensitive, and simple very well...and looks good too, I might add - sorry just had to put that in there!), and the lead female actress is great too. The other actors all do a decent job. The guy who played 'Jai' was generally very good, but his scenes with the 'Samira' character were stilted. I cringed every time he called her 'baby'.The film has a strong message, about being true to yourself, and finding good in others. There's also a message about using your talents and appreciating the gifts we each have. For me, the love that grew between the lead characters was very believable, and was the anchor for the story. We saw it develop over time - it wasn't over-sexualised or ridiculously sudden like in a lot of movies. And a lot of topical issues were dealt with in the movie, but not in a preachy way (see Shah Rukh Khan's 'Pardes' for an example of a Hindi movie that preached at the audience - I felt I was being hit over the head with a mallet). In 'Ramji Londonwaley', the messages are more subtle and therefore seem more sincere.I wasn't expecting too much from this movie (and it does start out a bit slow), but I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I loved and enjoyed it. A good job by all.\n",

            "I've enjoyed most films, like 'Do Aur Do Paanch', 'Suhaag' and 'Namak Halaal', with the Amitabh Bachchan-Shashi Kapoor duo. Although I did not like 'Deewar' or 'Kala Patthar', the duos strong essence is felt. 'Do Aur Do Paanch' starts off as a comedy with a lot of slapstick, cussing, situations and wit. Bachchan and Kapoor are back providing us with several laugh out loud moments. The director does a good job in presenting the story with its comedic twists. However, towards the ending it becomes a little melodramatic with less comedy. The dialogues are good and the performances are competent. Amitabh Bachchan is hilarious. His knack for comedy is clearly evident. Shashi Kapoor too leaves his mark even though Amitabh has the better lines. Hema Malini as the strong-minded but gullible teacher is fun to watch and Parveen Babi is quite glamorous and shares a great chemistry with Bachchan. I don't think Amitabh has had a better chemistry with any of his other leading ladies and that includes Rekha and Jaya Bhadhuri. Kader Khan is good as the evil Uncle. Child actor Bittoo hams it up. Rajesh Roshan's music is a mostly okay. The title songs (sung by the legendary Kishore Kumar) are laugh inducing as they got me chuckling all the time and Asha Bhosle's soothing 'Kya Kehti Hai' is very romantic. But, the rest of the songs are forgettable. Agnihotri and Bhowmick deserve credit for their writing which eventually gave us this fun film. I remember having seen 'Do Aur Do Paanch' decades ago and I watched it again last night. For me, it stood the test of time as the humour does not feel outdated. Even the action sequences which are of the dishum dishum sort have a touch of comedy. Perhaps it would have been more fun if there was just a little more comedy towards the end which gets a tad too dramatic. Nonetheless this is one film which dares to teach us that 2 + 2 does not equal 5.\n",

Though extremely Utopian, the movie shows how love and friendship can topple war. The use of puns has been very accurate. Actors are at their best.

It's a movie with a difference where horror has been presented with doses of humour.The film carries a message in the end that i shall refrain from telling as it would be a spoiler. In our daily running about to earn a living, many a times we think of going out for dinner or a movie to relax ourselves- if that is so, i assure you to watch Nanu Ki Jaanu- it is a laugh riot. Yes, by the end, you will get a little emotional too, but all in all, it's a comedy. Horror comedy.The film has memorable characters, be it the building's watchman (Ganesh Kumar), or the abusive husband (Sameer Siddique) or the pitiable wife (Aditi Kalkunte). The performance of Manu Rishi (who is also the film's writer) as one of Abhay's friend's is superb. Abhay himself has played a character that is away from his usual and he has done an outstanding job at that. Patralekhaa, who one wishes could have got some more screen time, has played her character quite admirably.Rajesh Sharma as the father of a single daughter is brilliant! Gifted actors such as Brijendra Kala, who has portrayed the character of a neighbour and as always is first-rate, should have got more screen space. Manoj Pahwa has a guest appearance but as we know, talented actors only need a few minutes to leave their mark.The songs are good- especially the love song though it could have been shot better. Dhruv Dhalla's background score is very good! Kashyap Chandhock's casting is unique and very effective.

The Special kid, played by Spandan Chaturvedi of Tv Serial Udan fame is brilliant .Faraz Haider's direction is good; the film keeps you hooked till the end.Mika's song, which is quite good and has also been filmed equally well, should have been part of the regular narrative of the story rather than being in the end. I am personally not in favour of the current trend of end credit songs because most people do not stay on to watch it.The Jagran scene could have been better.

Despite a few thrills & a leading man who delivers, this thriller is shunned down by erratic Writing & unwanted Songs.'Bhaag Johnny' Synopsis: Johnny is asked by his Screwed boss, to kill an innocent girl. A Genie, however, gives Johnny, the opportunity to live two lives, one being in which he kills the girl & the other in which he doesn't. Chaos follows...'Bhaag Johnny' doesn't make much use of its promising premise. Once the protagonist starts living both the lives, the excitement & the pacing one expects from the narrative, is mostly missing. However, the action-sequences are expertly done & some sequences, particularly in the film's last half, hold your attention. Also, there are too many songs in the goings-on, which honestly, add nothing to the story. They needed to be chopped off!The Screenplay is exciting, but in parts. Stronger Writing was needed here! Shivam Nair's Direction is alright. Cinematography captures the exotic locales of Thailand, nicely. Editing needed to be crisper. Music by Various Artists is good, but in the film, they appear forced.Performance-Wise: Kunal Khemu is a terrific actor & he pitches in a dependable performance, yet again! As Johnny, the torn protagonist, the actor expresses naturally & excels in the action bits. Zoa Morani is barely convincing. Mandana Karimi, (Who's in Bigg Boss now), is ordinary.

            "Vidhu Vinod Chopra has created a very Hitchcockian thriller. I liked the idea that the whodunnit story takes place among a films cast and crew as they are shooting on location. Chopra's reference to films like 'The Godfather' and 'Psycho' were quite funny. 'Khamosh' isn't as much a thriller as there's a lot of humour.While a few of it is unintentional, there's also plenty of satire. I especially enjoyed the humour that took place in the shooting scenes. For instance, the sequence where Shabana delivers her dialogue to Amol while lifeless hand keeps bumping on her foot and she's completely unaware of it.Some sequences were out of place and it appears as though Chopra just put them in for the sake of thrills. One such example is the scene where Shabana finds a drenched in blood dead chicken in her bed. It's also very easy to figure out that the lead suspects were not the actual murderers and after some time one can easily figure out who it is. Plot holes are also apparent. For example, why would Shabana go to the houseboat all by herself at night when there's a murderer on the loose?At the same time, it's great to watch such an excellent group of actors work together and I was interested in how the director would choose to conclude the film. Pankaj Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Amol Palekar are first rate. Azmi plays the Hitchcockian heroine with class and poise. Shah does a fine job as the fiery detective determined to solve the case. Palekar is cast against type and he is superb even though he has limited screen time. Soni Razdan does a decent job while the rest of the cast range from average to bad.Overall, 'Khamosh' may not be an out and about thriller it tries to be but it's entertaining nonetheless and I think it even has good repeat value.\n",

            "Naren is a simple man and son of an influential businessman in Calcutta. He goes to Himalayas on vacations and meets Ganga a local Himalayan girl. They fall in love and get married. Naren decides to go home and gain his family's confidence before he can take Ganga home. Naren comes back home and finds that his father has fixed his marriage with an ambitious politician Bhagwat Chowdhary's daughter. Naren sends Kunj, his maternal uncle and his well wisher, to fetch Ganga but Ganga, now pregnant, has already left alone from Himalayas to Calcutta. The whole journey of Ganga from Gangotri to Calcutta depicts the poor condition of women in the Indian society. First half of the film is perfect for toilet breaks, cigarette, pop corn and probably grocery. How long can you tolerate two bad actors that too together? Movie begins when Ganga leaves Himalayas for Calcutta. Ganga, traveling from Gangotri to Calcutta, represents river Ganga which starts from Himalayas and through northern plains reaches Calcutta and merges into Bay of Bengal. River Ganga is revered by Indians as god from ancient times. River Ganga get polluted on its way and the first bank which pollutes river Ganga is Haridwar and so Ganga (Mandakini) tastes her stint with fate in Haridwar. By the time she reaches Varanasi Ganga loses its purity. River Ganga flows almost like sewer water after that and that's what happens to the protagonist. She is sold bought raped and beaten by the time she reaches Calcutta. I find this film extremely romantic and spiritual. It talks about the fate of millions of innocent girls sold in India and the medium it uses is mind blowing. This film always reminds me of Bicycle thief. Sica used a bicycle to expose post world war Italy and Raj Kapoor has used a river to expose the double standards of Indian culture. At one point in time Ganga sleeps in a funeral house and consoles herself saying that dead ones are better than those living. Characterization is brilliant for example Kunj visits brothels but he loud mouths about it. Manilal is a pimp, a gray character, becomes a blind man to trap Ganga. Raj Kapoor says a lot through Manilal's black goggles. Some of the scenes are very bold. In one of the scenes Ganga, in a train to Varanasi, is feeding her infant son while men look at each other and smile. Acting wise Raza Murad and Saeed Jaffery are brilliant and soul of the film. Rajiv Kapoor couldn't do worse. 'Mandagini' could and she did. Music of the film is exceptional. All the songs except for 'Sun Saiba' and 'Main Hee Main Hoon' are beautiful and meaningful. I think it's the best score by 'Ravindra Jain' so far (better than even 'Nadiya Ke Paar' and 'Chitchor'). Lata Mangeshkar's voice is beginning to crack by this time and so male versions are an automatic preference. This film was released in the same year as 'Tawaif' and so best Dialog and story awards were given to 'Tawaif' ( a very well deserved ones too) else this movie would have got those too other than best film, best director, best art director and best music. I think this is Raj Kapoor's best film if not 'Prem Rog'. Prem Rog outshines this film because of the actors (of course Rishi Kapoor in 35 mm is magic) and topic but RTGM has high points and is more dramatic. I think Raj Kapoor should have stayed away from the nudity in this film as most people saw only nudity in this film (you can tell by the reviews only) but Raj Kapoor was a businessman too so he had to do his marketing bit. This film was a huge hit. Looking at the unchanged condition of India I guess Raj Kapoor was a good seller. He sold a movie against nudity with nudity. Reminds me of Goddard's 'Contempt' but that's how it is and will be. A must watch for spiritually bent Indians.\n",

            "When Anil Kapoor will look down on his Bollywood's career lane, this work will remind him of the actor he always had in him.This is one of those rare movies from Bollywood that remained completely honest to the genre. So different that if this was dubbed in English many including me would have considered it to be a Hollywood venture without having a moment of doubt, because you wouldn't find anything in it that is typical trademark of Bollywood like unnecessary inclusion of dance numbers, songs, desperate attempt to switch between genre to serve a good for nothing masala (spicy) stuff, and most importantly the running time.Although every cast member gave their best not to forget Boman Irani who was slowly making his mark in the Indian film industry (now a well established brand), it was Anil Kapoor all the way who made this work so mesmerizing.\n",

            "My other title for this review was \"this is a pretty good film for such a mess\". Director Ahmed Khan throws in just about every directorial style and most of the plot contrivances that he can think of, no matter how minor or unrelated to the main body of the film. The \"problem\"--what makes this a pretty good film despite that fact, is that on a detailed view, he's good at all of those styles (aside from a few moments of supreme cheesiness, perhaps), and if you are patient enough, or concentrate enough, to bore into the basic plot, the story is decent, with potential to be great. But this is a film that could strongly benefit by being cut down to about an hour and forty minutes, rather than its current almost three-hour running time.The story, which doesn't really kick into gear until after an hour has gone by--credits still appear about 20 minutes into the film--is centered on a \"gangster family of orphans\", curiously enough. Although I'm not quite clear on some of the details, the leader of the family is the eldest son, Arjun Rana (Sunny Deol), who looks and acts an awful lot like an Indian Kevin Spacey. He also has a brother, Karan (Sohail Khan), whom I believe was the biological son of their gangster father, and an adopted sister, Bindiya (Nauheed Cyrusi). I don't recall (or it wasn't said) what happened to the father. It's also not said just what the family does--what kinds of criminal activities, presumably--to sustain their wealth. And at one point, I was getting very confused by the fact that everyone was calling everyone else \"brother\" (presumably there was some slight inflection difference between \"blood brother\" and \" 'spiritual' brother\", but that's a generous guess).At any rate, the Rana family is eventually contrasted with two brothers (these two I know were blood brothers), Saahil (John Abraham) and Sanju (Sunil Shetty), who are from the \"wrong side of the tracks\", economically--the side where Arjun had his roots. Sanju is a mechanic and has a mostly benign street gang of his own, and Saahil is a college student--he goes to the same school as Bindiya and Karan. In addition to all the kitchen sinks (which I'll detail a bit in a minute), the film also gets into some of the gangster stuff you'd expect, but eventually it's much more of a love triangle film, with Bindiya placed between the love of her brother, Karan (this is one of the \"forbidden lines\" of the title), and Saahil.There's a line of dialogue, in Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon (2003), I believe, where someone in the film business says that sometimes Bollywood films start shooting even without a script--they just assemble a cast and make it up on the fly. Whether that's true or not, Lakeer begins as if that was the case. The first hour plays more like a director, cinematographer, editor or production designer's reel--a reel of unrelated clips put together to show their skill in a wide variety of styles which they hope will get them work--than it plays like a film.In this first hour, the cinematography is technically impressive. Johny Lal uses a lot of cutting-edge \"extended techniques\", including different film stocks, changing speeds, swooping crane shots, skewed angles and so on. The production design is lush and beautiful, loaded with intense colors and textures, from the sets to the costumes and props. The editing is varied and also employs a lot of modern \"extended techniques\", including \"MTV-styled\" quick cuts. The songs are unusual and catchy.The scenes in this section rapidly change from slower sections establishing the Rana family at home to car racing sequences straight out of The Fast and the Furious (2001), modern Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) song and dance sequences that feature the gangster family all smiling and dancing, singing \"What's Up?\" while others rap, Basketball sequences that shout--\"Hey, look how modern and hip we are\" but that can't convey any drama or sense of the game, extended cheerleading songs, updated Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) stuff, and so on. It's clear that a lot of this stuff is intended to capture the youth market (and a quick glance at the voting demographics so far suggests that it may have worked--Lakeer is much more strongly liked proportional to how young the viewer is). But as impressive as a lot of this stuff is technically, it's not very coherent as a whole, and it feels like beating around the bush until Khan thinks of a story to tell.More curious, once he does think of a story to tell, shortly after the hour mark, he largely leaves the showboating technical stuff by the wayside. He occasionally gives a backward glance at it--his memory isn't that bad--but the cinematography, production design, editing and so forth become more conventional, or even pedestrian, for the rest of the film. The story becomes good enough to carry the proceedings. The gangster material is especially good, but unfortunately, it's more flirted with than engaged in. This could have been a great, gritty film, but it's too schizophrenic for that.Also, once the showboating calms down, it lets other minor problems come to the fore. Some many will not notice--such as the sound design, which has \"punch\" sound effects when a character grabs another by the lapels and goofy \"swoop\" sounds to accompany cinematographic and editing manipulations. Some many will be more prone to notice, like the occasional overacting, often resulting in humorously scrunched up faces--intended to show \"emotional anguish\".But overall, Lakeer isn't a failure as long as you can slog your way through the chaff. There's at least one compelling story and a lot of admirable style at the film's core. I would recommend the film with caution proportional to your age.\n",

            "Looks like Ekta Kapoor produces another not-that-great thriller and also uses the same locales. A good thriller usually does have the shocking moments that make you jump in your seat, and this movie \"kind of\" has some of those, but you have no idea who/what is scaring everyone. Is it a ghost? Is it a murderer? Is it a victim? Nothing seems to make sense. Pointless scaring is not scary at all. The story finally makes sense towards the end, but it's too late by then. Some rather unconvincing scenes are more comical than they are scary. Rati Agnihotri is a good actress, but her ghost scene is absolutely hilarious. Songs are okay. Sohail and Isha gave a decent performance.\n",

            "Bollywood has presented many immensely popular comedies like Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, Golmaal, Chupke Chupke, Padosan, Lage Raho Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots etc. which are much talked about movies. However today I am reviewing an underrated comedy which is definitely a flawless and highly admirable comedy but quite unjustifiably neither got big commercial success nor much discussed. It's Naram Garam (1981) whose director is none else than the director of classic comedies like Golmaal and Chupke Chupke, i.e., Hrishikesh Mukherjee.Naram Garam (soft hot) is the story of a rich widower, Bhavani Shankar (Utpal Dutt) and his unmarried employee, Ram Prasad (Amol Palekar). Bhavani Shankar is a miser but at the same time highly superstitious. He lives with his younger brother, Kali Shankar (Shatrughan Sinha) and his motherless daughter, Sumi (Kiran Vairale). Ram Prasad loves Kusum (Swaroop Sampat), the daughter of a poor old man, Vishnu Prasad (A.K. Hangal) whose son is Ram Prasad's friend and in his bid to earn, remains out of home for most of the time, doing village theatre (moving from village to village). When Vishnu Prasad and Kusum become homeless, Ram Prasad temporarily shifts them to the ancestral house of Bhavani Shankar which has been won recently in a much-prolonged court case and now under his possession for getting it renovated. However when this fact is known to the corrupt and lustful manager of Bhavani Shankar (Suresh Chatval), he pressurizes Vishnu Prasad to marry Kusum to her. How Ram Prasad tackles this situation and how the twists and turns keep on coming in the story, finally leading to Ram Prasad's marrying Kusum, forms the remaining part of the story which is full of laughs and laughs only. However in between the laughs, there are sentimental and moving scenes too and an undercurrent of emotion is continuously there in the narrative.Naram Garam provides laughs from the very first frame to the very last frame (when the words - THE END appear on the screen). However despite being a comedy, it can be categorized as a very good satire also, ridiculing the superstitious Indians. It hits hard the swindling astrologers too, found in every nook and corner of our country. Besides, it portrays quite realistically that when a helpless man has a young girl in his family (sister or daughter), every unscrupulous person eyes her in return for some favour done to them.The movie has many emotional twists too and the emotional bonds between human-beings have been depicted in such an impressive manner that it moves the audience deep within. It has been done through relations among the characters of the people in the theatre world (Neelu Phule, Padma Chavan and the actor playing Kusum's brother) as well as through the two pairs of widower father and motherless daughter (Utpal Dutt-Kiran Vairale and A.K. Hangal-Swaroop Sampat). It is a healthy, no-nonsense, natural comedy in which laughs amalgamate with tears. The movie is so interesting and rib-tickling that it cannot be left in-between even for a minute. Besides, each character is able to maintain his identity and leave a mark in the movie. The writers (Shanu Banerjee-D.N. Mukherjee-Manoje Basu) alongwith the director, Hrishi Da deserve full marks for their work.The performances are all highly admirable. Utpal Dutt is all pervasive in the movie as the superstitious employer of Amol Palekar and creates an amazing on-screen chemistry with him. This role of a submissive but witty employee is tailor-made for Amol Palekar. Miss India of 1979, Swaroop Sampat debuted with this movie (later on she acted in a very popular comedy T.V. serial - Ye Jo Hai Zindagi and now she is the wife of actor Paresh Rawal). Acting wise she is OK but her voice sucks. Quite surprisingly, Shatrughan Sinha has delivered a great comic performance in the movie as the unmarried younger brother of Utpal Dutt. Kiran Vairale as the motherless daughter of Utpal Dutt has given an emotional performance on one hand but on the other she has created laughs too by teasing her unmarried uncle, Shatrughan in the song - Ek Baat Suni Hai Chachaji Batlaane Wali Hai. Among others, the actor playing Kusum's brother deserves a special mention alongwith Padma Chavan and Neelu Phule.R.D. Burman has given good music in the movie and the beautiful lyrics have been written by Gulzar. I personally like the emotional song picturized on Kiran Vairale - Mere Chehre Mein Chhupa Hai Meri Maa Ka Chehra (Asha) very much. Comedy song - Ek Baat Suni Hai Chachaji Batlaane Wali Hai (Sushma Shreshth and Shatrughan Sinha) is definitely a treat to listen and to watch. Other songs are also quite good to listen. One trivia about the melodious romantic song - Hamen Raaston Ki Zaroorat Nahin Hai - is that it did not get much popular and after 3-4 years, R.D. Burman used exactly the same tune for the song - Saagar Kinare Dil Ye Pukare (Saagar-1985) which became (and still is) immensely popular.Technically the movie is perfect. The length is also OK considering the fact that it does not contain a single boring moment.It is indeed very hard to find any deficiency in this movie. It is near perfect. A healthy comedy. A meaningful and thought-provoking comedy with a good mix of emotions. Considering its merits, it's definitely underrated. It has immense repeat value and will make you laugh every time you watch it. I recommend it wholeheartedly to all the movie buffs. Watch again ! Laugh again !\n",

            "Two of today's most stylish actors, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Bipasha, team up for this sci-fi thriller revolving around a unique camera that can take snaps of the future. Both stars sizzle the screen and make a fresh combination. It is interesting to see how the photographs turn into reality, and more so the limitless possibilities and power it brings to the camera's owner. It has the potential to prevent crimes, save lives, and benefit the country. Fallen into the wrong hands, one can gain a dangerously unstoppable amount of power and create havoc. The real journey begins when a photo is clicked revealing a dark fate for NNM. What is exactly is this fate? Can the camera be wrong? Can NNM fight against his own destiny? The film is an entertaining one--of course nothing to be taken too seriously as it is a masala fare. Nice cinematography and use of colors make it an exciting watch on the big screen. The song at the bar is really ridiculous and should have been cut. The end credits music video is terrific.\n",

            "Two young people in love are making a trip through the desert and take the bypass round a town. On the bypass their car is ambushed by two men who kill them and take their possessions. The two men then make their way across the hills to get some food. However they are not the only corrupt people in the area and nobody in the area seems to be beyond violence and crime.With no words in English and no subtitles, it was important that this short film be meaningful, easy to follow and clear. For a part of the film it the middle you are unsure of where it is going and it appears to wander a little bit, but it manages to end really well and mark itself out as a short film that focuses on a generally very violent and corrupt little area. The lack of meaningful dialogue wasn't really a problem as the film did enough to keep me involved in the story and the situation without the need for words. Of course the cast do a lot to help this and they are all pretty good - the standout being the first of the two criminals who has to carry a lot with looks and such.On top of a good tale, the film's main attraction is that it looks great and is very professionally put together - this is not a student film or a short with a restrictive budget. The film looks very polished and the use of locations rather than studios or sets really helps. The film stock gives the film a further professional touch and it does look really very good considering the comparatively low budget that it was made on.Overall, the short is based on a really enjoyable little tale, although you need patience and not to expect that tight a narrative. The lack of dialogue is not a problem and the film's main selling point is that it is very professional and looks like a great deal more money was spent on it than actually was.\n",

            "Seems like Anil Kapoor's attempt in production backfires every time. First it was under-rated \"Gandhi My Father\" and now \"over-rated\" Shortkut. Heavily borrowing from Hollywood and Malayalam, Neeraj & Anees Bazmee forgot to give a shoe-shine to the product. Should have learnt an important lesson from their master, Priyadarshan. For a comedy to succeed, one doesn't need good comic actors. It eventually boils down to the content and timing. Sadly the actors have pushed their limit to the get only the latter right. The screenplay is slow and dialogues painfully stale resulting in a yawn.Love-track between Akshaye & Amrita starts off on a \"Notting Hill\" note and ends up \"Akele Hum Akele Tum\" even before you have settled in. Circuit seems have gone over Arshad Warsi's head and it shows. Chunky Pande was wasted.It was unwarranted for the plot to move on foreign locales and a tail of producers to go with. And one of the producer was a bad hybrid of Paresh Rawal & Rajpal Yadav. Good Samaritan's were thrown in plenty in addition to coincidences in the plot - cinematic liberties might be an apt word perhaps.

            "MONSOON SHOOTOUT at the 12th Indian FIlm Festival of Los Angeles LAIFF Reviewed by Alex Deleon-Sinha, April 29, 2014. --- Monsoon Shootout\", a brilliant multi-layered debut feature by Amit Kumar is, among other things, a dazzling noir thriller drenched in rain starring Nawaz Siddiqui as a serial hatchet killer (!). It was really the main event of the 2014 IFFLA, but was inexplicably programmed as a throwaway on the last day and not given much attention while a dumb movie in the main hall pulled in the biggest crowd of the week.Director Amit Kumar of Monsoon Shootout did show up on the very last night, in and out ~ to accompany his film and hold a Q & A. after which, over a drink in the lobby, he revealed to me that he was very impressed by the Polish film \"Blind Chance\" (Przypadek) a 1981 masterpiece by Krzysztof Kieslowski -- and that the basic idea for Monsoon Shootoot came from the Kieslowski picture. In both pictures -- both classic mindbenders -- the same story is told three times over with different outcomes each time. In this one you see normally lovable Nawaz Siddiqi as a psychotic ax-killer in two versions, but the last one makes you question which one was reality, and which ones were fantasy. Did the rookie cop who was stalking him all the time really have to shoot him as he was clambering over a wall? -- and Maybe he wasn't really the killer after all ....Huh? This was a revelation to me because I too was greatly impressed by \"Blind Chance\" when I saw it in Poland years ago, and subliminally caught the parallels between the two films as I watched the current \"Monsoon Shootout\", but the Indian details as worked out by Kumar are totally different. It would make a remarkable evening of film watching to pair these two films up -- among other things to see the contrasting cultures and the contrasting acting styles of two fantastic actors-- Nawazzudin Sadiqi and Polish actor Boguslaw Linda who, in 1981, was the most popular film star in Poland. The film title is itself multi-resonant, suggesting an imploded version of \"Monsoon Wedding\" engaged to a Watery vision of \"Shootout at the O.K. Corral\" -- with the latter of which it has far more in common. A terrific movie that needs to be seen several time to pick up on all the nuances and counter- themes -- but do Bring an umbrella!\n",

            "Kasoor (guilt) is a movie from the Bhatt camp of bollywood who shamelessly steals stories from the Hollywood movies and put them before the ignorant Indian audience by Indianizing their milieu and characters. Kasoor (2001) is one such movie only which is a clear-cut rip off from the Hollywood thriller, Jagged Edge (1985). However the movie is well-made and entertaining right from the start to the finish.This is the story of a young and gorgeous female lawyer who is trapped by a criminal through his sweet talks and fake love. The emotional lady, working in good faith, and fascinated by the charms of the cunning criminal, commits the error of mixing her personal life with the professional one, falls into the love of the prince-charming who has been charged for the murder of his wife and quite naturally, performs the job of his defence lawyer, not by her brains but by her heart, seeking wholehearted help of her best buddy and finally gets her lover-cum-client acquitted. The truth comes out before her afterwards only.I do not put this movie into the mystery genre because there is little doubt about at least the identity of the murderer. Instead, I put it under the category of court-room dramas because it's the scenes of the court-room only which make the movie a thoroughly interesting and entertaining one and keep the viewer glued to the screen throughout. The entry and exit of different supporting characters in the court-room drama add spice to it. Since the central character of the movie is an emotional lady who can be won over by passionate love, there is ample doz of romance and emotions too for the viewers.Mahesh Bhatt, the writer (?) and Vikram Bhatt, the director have adapted the plot of Jagged Edge quite skillfully for the Indian audience. They have been ably supported by the cinematographer (Praveen Bhatt), the dialogue-writer (Girish Dhamija) and the performers.Lisa Ray's dialogues have been dubbed in the voice of someone else, but this gorgeous lady has infused life into the role of the intelligent but emotional lady-lawyer whose sentiments make her err. Aftab Shivdasani has done the job of the accused quite admirably and at least in the scenes filled with love and delicate sentiments, he is just superb. Apoorva Agnihotri has underplayed the role of the heroine's best pal, nicely. In the movies of Bhatt Camp, the supporting cast is more or less the same (like permanent labourers) and they perform according to the need of the plot and as instructed by the director. However, Ashutosh Rana stands out with his first rate performance in the role of the investigating officer. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes of the movie belong to him only and it's his performance which makes the viewer to go through the rest of the movie.Nadeem-Shravan did not get any award for the music of this movie which is definitely an injustice to them because the music (containing the very very meaningful and touching lyrics of Sameer) is soul-comforting and memorable. The album contains six songs and all six are excellent (the first two being outstanding in my opinion) - 1. Kitni Bechain Hoke Tumse Mili, 2. Jo Meri Rooh Ko Chain De Pyar De, 3. Kal Raat Ho Gayi Mulaqaat Ho Gayi, 4, Dil Mera Tod Diya Usne Bura Kyun Manoon, 5. Mohabbat Ho Na Jaaye, 6. Koi To Saathi Chaahiye. If not for the story, the movie can be watched for the songs themselves.I had watched this movie in the year of its release, i.e., 2001 and recently I watched it again on internet. The viewers who have not seen Jagged Edge, will find it quite interesting. And even if you have watched the Hollywood movie but you are a melody lover and like high-intensity court-room dramas (like me), you will find this watch a satisfactory one for sure.\n",

It covers multiple genres – Action, Social Message, Suspense, Comedy and Drama.Guddu and Rangeela work as orchestra members for weddings  who also make a secondary living as informants of thieves(They provide a money estimate of the wedding-homes they play at and the exact time to carry out the theft).How they get embroiled in a kidnapping of a girl? How they become enemies with a local goon politician who acts like an adviser to the Khap Panchayats ?  And finally, how they take revenge and fight with the goon politician and his aides ?These are the questions that the audience finds the answer to as the movie progresses.20 mins. into the movie and I was blown away by the background score during the action scenes. Very few Indian movies use creative and innovative rock music for their action scenes and this movie is one of them. Being a rock-music lover and a guitarist, I was simply absorbed by the music and my expectation from this movie grew a bit.The dialogues are probably the most important ingredient in this non-Khans/non-Kapoors small starrer movie. The non-Hindi viewers (watching through subtitles) will probably not be able to relish the movie due to non-comprehension of the original Hindi dialogues.I liked almost all the characters in this movie but my favorite has to be Ronit Roy who plays the goon-politician. You can actually feel his terror and the cold-heartedness throughout the film.The camera-work ranges between good to excellent and there are a couple of beautiful close shots. The screenplay is interesting and keeps the suspense part of the movie alive. It was only in the last 15-20 mins. that I got disappointed with the director. At the end, the movie reeks of the masala Hindi movie action scenes where the logic goes out of the box. In a nutshell, I applaud the intentions of the filmmakers to create a film which tries to convey a social message through drizzles of humour and without sounding too-preachy. This movie should reach out to a wider audience, especially those who don't wish to view out-and- out serious movies with low entertainment/leisure content. The Friday evening show had only about 30 people in the cinema hall. I am guessing that the box office will pick up the collections from Saturday night when the people will get to know about 'Guddu Rangeela' from their friends/family/colleagues/ acquaintances.\n",

Sad isn't it? That's the state of most of the films of this genre made today. It's so much more challenging to make a film from your own imagination. Inspiration is also important, but a copy, why? Well the answer does not seem to be coming. I watched this film because of so many recommendations and I finally did it. And yes, this one really is an enjoyable fare - a very fast-paced, gripping suspense thriller which turns into an interesting courtroom drama. Sunny Deol stars as Ajay and he does well after quite a long time. Do not recall any good part since Gaddar. Here he is quiet and restrained. Isha Koppikar is effective as his unfaithful wife. Irrfan plays the investigating officer yet again, and he plays his determined act well. Konkona Sen Sharma gets a very small role, and she makes a great impact like only she can. The ending was pretty good. Right Ya Wrong may be unoriginal but if you can get past this fact, you will certainly enjoy watching it with family and friends. Just for fun.\n",

Then Eela's husband decides to leave his family for some logicless Reasons and Eela becomes a Single mother from a regular mother. Rest story needs to be watched by yourself to decide where did it make sense? Helicopter Eela rarely makes sense and even at those rare occasions, the Execution is below par. Plenty of moments leave you with confused reactions like, 'Wait... What? How could be...? How can this happen? What the hell was that? And so on... In short this is a story of bond between an overprotective mother and her highly practicle son, which should have been told in better way. In between we see some moral lecture kind of sentences and self discovery of Eela in latest fashion. While creating 90's era director fails to capture the theme but somehow manages to create that atmosphere through effective use of small properties. Kajol looks elegance beauty at several occassions but here also her make up speaks louder than her acting which wasn't expected from an actress. Riddhi as her practical son and nowdays buddy, dude kind of guy is noticeable. Rest of the cast is decent. Music of the Film is Very Good, you might feel this is an exegarration but you will agree with me when you see those songs on screen. Screenplay is messy, has so many dull parts which should have been removed by editor. Overall its the Director who is at Fault. First of all Pradeep Sarkar should have worked more on the script, then he should have had a better vision to tell this story through film. There are so many over-dramatic and senseless loopholes throughout the narration that as a whole Helicopter Eela end up on a low note. Even if you are a Fan of Kajol still, you have to skip this one and better be waiting for a good film from her which will have a strong characterisation. Coming up to the Box Office Prediction, Helicopter Eela will definitely find it tough at ticket windows as the competition is too much and Content isn't completable. RATING- 4/10*\n",

            "Although the romantic, suave and serene Rajesh Khanna has other big hits to his credits like AMAR PREM, ANAND, SAFAR and ARADHANA but in KATI PATANG, his inherent and innate acting prowess shot to that vintage point from where, the exact reflection of his acting skills that were imbued in mystic, elegant and romantic gestures emerged supreme. Coupled with great hit songs and excellent direction of Shakti Samantha, KATI PATANG is a memorable landmark in the filmography of Rajesh Khanna. Being her last lead acting performance on the silver screen, Asha Parekh has also consummately portrayed the pensive image of a forced widow lover.The real to life turbulent story of an innocent girl who was betrayed by her clever boyfriend, had to bear the brunt of a lifetime stigma. Shakti Samantha's direction, R.D. Burman's choreography of songs and majestically soothing cinematography by Gopi Krishna made \"Kati Patang\" a toast for the eyes and a sublime stimulant for the spirit of audience. The songs and the wording transcends the true beauty of pure love along with the flow of tumultuous events, thereby captivating the audience to stick to their seats till the end. Folks ! they don't make it like Kati Patang, any more ........\n",

            "Some films prove you absolutely wrong when you just ignore them in comparison to few big films and then end up cursing yourself for making such a weak assumption about the movie. MIRCH was definitely one of those few under-estimated films which not only surprised me with its bold content but also made me think several times about all the relevant questions raised in its thought provoking script, after a long time.But before praising the movie further, I would first like to mention that MIRCH is not at all a technically brilliant film from any angle nor it can be included in the list of all those perfectly acted or directed films either, to be precise. Yet, the reason why I am including it in my MUST SEE MOVIES List is that it is a very rare movie which is both likable as well as hateful in a very strange manner.In fact MIRCH is a novel kind of daring attempt which at one end surely entertains you in a very fresh and mesmerizing style, but on the other hand it may also seriously offend both the MALE and FEMALE genders equally in a very dishonorable way. Talking about four different stories on the sexual relationship between man and women in contrasting backgrounds, the film is a pretty bold sex comedy which strictly calls for an adult viewing without any doubt. And in the end it may also turn out to be a dangerous movie putting many new unwanted ideas into your mind un-necessarily.In short, its a Vinay Shukla directed film made on a very bold sexual subject, which for the first time explores the topic of adultery from the woman's side. In all the four stories in the film, it's the woman who betrays and cheats her husband in a very harsh way, whereas its only the fourth one in which the husband too is doing the similar kind of act on the other side. In each act of betrayal shown in the film, the women play on a certain trick and get away with their disrespectful act very smartly. On a controversial note, even after being a fairly entertaining flick, the film may come out to be both confusing and disturbing for a certain section of viewers who may like to take the depiction of Man and Women in its stories in a bad taste.Where the women might feel being shown with an intolerably sickening attitude, the men too might feel being portrayed as fools and silly husbands on the screen with a pinch of humor. But at the same time, both the genders would also feel thoroughly entertained deep inside from their heart (which they may choose to hide). And that's actually what I liked the best about MIRCH, a movie which can generate such wide diverse reactions among the viewers which may go beyond any imagination of human mind.In bold words, the film may be thought provoking for some and a kind of soft porn for many. It may be enlightening experience for one and a disgusting thought of a pervert mind for the other. It may seem to be a journey into the mind of woman for one and might turn out to be a waste of time for the other. And since there are not many movies which are capable of generating such variety of responses in the viewers, MIRCH becomes an important film to be seen and studied in your own unique way. Here I would also like to add that in spite of being based on such bold subject, the seducing and intimate scenes in the film never go beyond a certain limit and remain un-objectionable, which indeed is a great job done by the director and his cinematographer.Reportedly the film is partly inspired from the Italian Classic \"The Decameron\" by Giovanni Boccaccio and partly from \"Panchtantra\" as mentioned in the movie itself. However, I was quite surprised with the reference of \"Panchtantra\" in it, because I only had a vision of 'Panchtantra' as a collection of moral stories for the young ones. May be I would have to research on it a little more. Anyway, along with its interesting concept, director Vinay Shukla uses his entire talented star-cast in an intelligent way where no one looks like doing something wrong on the screen and also entertains. It only takes few initial moments to move into the actual theme of the movie and then it starts making its impact pretty fast.On the whole, MIRCH is a movie which should be seen by all as a must because one cannot guess what actually you will make out of it in the end. After watching it, you may get a feeling close to the one mentioned above or in other case, you might go on to discover something of your own in the four stories unfolding on the screen one by one. But you essentially got to see it first to make your own decision.\n",

            "Controversial, graphic, violent, unsettling, disturbing, devastating & disgusting but an underrated cinema nonetheless that dares to explore the darkest side of adult industry, there's no denying that A Serbian Film is destined to upset majority of viewers with its gross, sickening & utterly discomforting subject matter which is exactly its motive but looking beyond its on- screen depiction of every taboo, it's also a pretty bold piece of filmmaking.Set in Serbia, the film tells the story of Milos; a well-past-his-prime porn star who's happily married & has a son but the family is going through financial difficulties. Contacted by one of his former colleagues who has a job offer for him, Milos is introduced to the new director & finally agrees to participate in an \"art film\" only to discover that he's been drafted into making a pedophilia & necrophilia themed snuff film.Brilliantly directed, fairly performed, effectively paced, superbly handling the elements of suspense & featuring many deeply disturbing sequences from start to finish, A Serbian Film is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the easily distressed or even a completely normal human being plus its so-called political allegory is nothing but an excuse to justify the pervertedness depicted here as the only reason why this film exists is to shock the viewers in the name of art.Yet, a story like this needed to surface on the screen not because it has a motive but because it represents a far darker side of world which most people choose to ignore, despite being aware of its existence. On an overall scale, A Serbian Film is an extremely unnerving story about porn industry but is definitely not porn plus it isn't afraid to jump deep into the abyss & bring everything to the surface, which it manages to do in an unflinching manner.Yes it's going to leave you emotionally scarred & No, you don't have to watch it just for the sake of it. Make your mind multiple times before you hit the play button and for those who think they can handle this stuff, just when you'll be thinking that this sadistic experience is finally over & you're almost out of this dark tunnel, the final line just before the end credits will do enough damage to break all hell loose.

            "Jagte Raho is one of the most amazing classics of Indian cinema. It is sad, comic, tragic, humorous, authentic, educative and entertaining. This magnificent social dramedy relates the story of one poor and innocent peasant who comes to the big city of Bombay in hopes of improving his life. However, while looking for some water to quench his thirst, he is constantly branded a thief by the citizens of the city and chased like a criminal. Looking for a hideout, still thirsty and hungry, he enters an apartment building, running from one flat to another, and ironically, every flat he hides in, he meets different \"elite\" citizens, all of whom can be easily called thieves.The film shows the double standards of our society, the cruelty and the corruptness, but not in a stereotypical way. It is natural and real. This naive peasant represents the simple common man who becomes a victim for no fault of his own, not only in India but in the entire world. He encounters different sorts of thefts and crimes committed by those so-called \"respectable\" citizens of the city, those who call him a thief and chase him just because he yearns for a few drops of water so that they can hide their own misdemeanors. This is so unbelievable yet so true.Raj Kapoor is the film's main protagonist and may I say, this is one of the finest works of his career, both as a filmmaker and particularly as an actor. The fear in his eyes is so haunting. You really feel for him as you witness his pain, his thirst, his misery, his innocence and his helplessness. The film's final scenes are absolutely fantastic. Kapoor's outburst on the roof of the building in front of the entire nation as he reproaches them for their inhumanity is well-done. The next two scenes are the film's final and finest. The first, when he gets onto the porch of another flat where he meets the cute-as-a-button Daisy Irani is heart-breaking. Irani's five-minute role of a kind-hearted, joyful and fearless little girl (which is contrary to the rest of the building's residents) who motivates the peasant to exit the building and face the people, is very memorable. There starts the film's best song, \"Jago Mohan Pyaare\" and we meet a young woman played by Nargis. The graciousness in her eyes and the brief, wordless interaction between Kapoor and Nargis create a magical, unforgettable scene which brings to a beautiful ending. See the film to understand how beautiful it is. This truly is an extraordinary picture.\n",

            "Santosh Sivan's Tahaan is a beautiful joy-ride down a child's psyche and his perception of the world around him that rotates on the give-and-take policy.\"Tahaan's meaning is different in different languages. In some languages it means 'Merciful', in Bengali it means 'Tolerance' while in some other languages it means 'Curse'. Actually here the boy is named Tahaan. \" says Santosh Sivan, the director of this films. His films (Tahaan, Before the Rains, Prarambha (short), Navarasa, Anandabhadram, Theeviravaathi: The Terrorist, Malli, Halo, Asoka..) have always been something I look forward to..The tranquil valley, reverberating with the constant shelling and army beats sets the perfect foil which paradise on earth witnesses everyday, the affection with which both the militants and the separatists handle Tahaan's inquisitiveness rather asserts the fact that irrespective of what one is , one's heart melts in front of something so innocent and beautiful. Santosh Sivan strikes the right chord with this film, one wonders why such a palpable insight into Kashmir was missing in films dealing with the same issues..This movie will give you an experience you can't find a substitute for.. watch it for its effort..\n",

            "A sequel to the much-loved Tere Bin Laden, 'Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive' is sadly an Uneven Sequel, that lacks the spirit & the humour of its prequel. Though fun in parts, the film never turns into a hilarious joyride. Sikander Kher, however, delivers one of the best performances of the year so far!'Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive' Synopsis: A Bollywood director is hired by an American talent agent to make a film on Osama bin Laden. The plan to use an Osama doppelganger in order to prove his death boomerangs when a Taliban arms dealer hijacks their idea to prove he's alive.'Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive' has a dull start, but things begin to move once Sikandar's character goes through a make-over & how his motives result into some rib-tickling moments with the character of Paddi (played by Pradhuman Singh). Sadly, the pace again drops pre-climax & even the end to this story seems hurried. My only question to the Writers is, why did you keep it down on the humour? Wasn't that the brand here?The Screenplay has a few punches, but overall, they lack consistency. Abhishek Sharma is not in form this time. After The Shaukeens, this is another missed opportunity from the director. Cinematography is decent. Editing & Art Design are mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, its Sikandar all the way. He's simply superb in both the roles he depicts, one as the US Agent & the other as the loud Punjabi Film Producer. Its good to see the actor finally getting a role that exhibits his talent to the hilt. Manish Paul is over-the-top, while Pradhuman Singh is very cute as Paddi. Piyush Mishra is a riot in his part. Sugandha Garg is natural the core. Ali Zafar is effective in a cameo.On the whole, besides some fine acting, 'Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive' scores lower on laughs.\n",

            "Normally I trawl through the IMDb movies section to see a movie I can review for fun, that was where I came across this early Salman Khan movie. I was shocked to find not one single review for it, then I decided that I was going to take it upon myself to put that right. It brought fond memories of a happy childhood watching Bollywood movies. I remember watching this movie in the early 90's and thought that before I review it it would be sensible to watch it again. After watching it I can say it has dated fairly well. Patthar Ke Phool was known for Raveena Tandon's first movie and for a debut she was pretty good. Patthar Ke Phool tells the story of two lovers,Salman Khan and Raveena Tandon. Salman's father is a policeman whilst Raveena Tandon's is a criminal. Throughout the movie we get the feeling that there is good in him and the real villain is his associate Goga Kapoor. Patthar ke phool could have gone the clichéd route(the usual Bollywood drama about lovers and disapproving parents) but it refrains from that. Salman's father is getting heavily involved in the case of Raveena's criminal father and is intent on bringing him to justice. Raveena's father organises his murder on the same day Salman and Raveena come to him and tell him they are getting married. During the conversation Salman Khan brings up that his father is a policeman and tells him his father's name. Raveena's father attempts to stop the murder but he is too late and Salman's father gets killed. Salman then decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a policeman and finds out the truth about Raveena's father, what does he do?watch it to find out. Salman Khan and Raveena Tandon were pretty good but in my opinion Vinod Mehra outshone them as Salman's father. Unfortunately he died of a heart attack before the movie was released(may he rest in peace) The music is exceptional, my favourites being Kabhi too chalia lagta hain. I have fond memories of that song since it makes references to several Bollywood movies in it. Patthar Ke Phool needs more appreciation from fans of Bollywood and deserves to have more comments posted on IMDb about it, surely there are fans of Bollywood out there that remember this movie.Highly recommended by me\n",

            "\"Mera Saaya\" is an incredibly striking picture and it should provide a completely pleasurable watch not only for lovers of Hindi cinema and its golden era, but also for those who love thrillers which have both tension and substance. This film is about a young lawyer who is still mourning his wife's recent death and soon learns that an alleged criminal woman who looks exactly like his late wife stands trial in court and in her defense claims to be his own wife. From then on, the story follows how Rakesh, who is totally convinced of his wife's death (having actually seen her body before it was cremated), firmly attempts to disprove her claims despite the amazingly genuine evidences she presents in court. The film has a great mix of suspense and romance, and the mystery does not get solved until the very end, although it manages to attract different assumptions from the viewers. The plot is interestingly twisted with unexpected proceedings. Raj Khosla's direction is very good; he delicately refines the film's intensity, yet makes sure the viewer keeps watching it until the fantastic ending. The film has a great Sunil Dutt, who successfully portrays the grief-stricken yet decisive Rakesh, but the greatest impact is made by Sadhana who shines in a brilliantly played dual role (even this aspect remains unclear yet unsuspected for the most part). The music is very nice, and the title song is beautifully sung by Lata Mangeshkar. All in all, \"Mera Saaya\" is another fine movie of 1966 (a year of many great films). I highly recommend you to watch this classic.\n",

            "His name is Quick Gun Murugun, mind it! And I think the passengers around me would have thought I was mad enough to watch an Indian film, and an Indian cowboy one at that, laughing out loud in almost every scene which I can't help to because it's just so funny.I mean, face it, here's probably the only Indian vegetarian Cowboy hero whose main objective in life is to take care of the cows (well, at least that's what cowboys do he believes), as well as being the guardian of the sacred animal of course. Armed with no more than two 6-shooters and a fancy gunplay technique, Quick Gun Murugun (Dr Rajandra Prasad) protects the meek from meat-eating gangsters such as Rice Plate Reddy (Nasser) who has megalomaniac plans to rid the world of vegetarianism!Sounds dastardly, but not if our hero can help it, while juggling with his relationship woes with Locket Lover (Anu Menon) who resides in, well, his locket! For all the garish colours in his outfit of choice, the villains he goes up against is just as colourful, with names such as Gun Powder (Shanmughraja) and Rowdy MBA (Raju Sundaram), each with their own comical quirks that fans of Indian cinema would come to appreciate, and chuckle at. And despite our hero possessing some great skill with his pistols (head shots only, no less), he comes with an inherent weakness, and that's the number of bullets his pistols can store, before getting soundly beaten.It's actually two films in one, with a time travelling and supernatural elements brought in for good measure, and more laughter. In present day Mumbai, he continues to seek out his arch enemy Rice Plate, who has gone on to start McDosa, a fast food chain bent on making Dosa from meat thanks to the recipe of Dr Django (Ashwin Mushran). And while waiting for more gunslinging action, there's another romantic subplot thrown in which involved Rice Plate's current moll Mango Dolly (Rambha), and how Quick Gun's now a fish out of water, If you find the plot quite ridiculous, it actually is! And everything is just so hammed up, from the saturated colours, acting and dialogue, that it's actually incredibly smart in knowing when to hit the right notes, making you do double takes at just about every scene. Sight gags are galore too, and I reckon with every re-watch you'll find something new to laugh at, either from signages in some corner, or by the dialogue which come in healthy doses of Inglish.If you're game for some irreverent comedy and one that has plenty of gags, then watch Quick Gun Murugun, which I endorse, I say!\n",

            "Okay, this is supposed to be an issue-based film. If so, its issues are hiding under a most preachy, corny story of the innocent girl who is raped and transformed. There are two extremes here. First, our leading lady is naive in the most unbelievable ways, much to the point of thinking that just being kissed by a guy could get her pregnant, and then she is unable to smile. Her second phase of course makes perfect sense considering how atrocious this whole experience was for her, but the transformation is just not convincing enough to me.Now, I know, this is a Raj Kapoor film, you can always expect superb photography, great music, and indeed, it's all there, but the banality of the story, as well as the exhaustingly long runtime of the film for a story that would require less, makes the entire thing really quite tedious. The film is a visual treat, no doubt, it is beautifully shot, the extravagance of the sets is overwhelming, and even the music helps to create an entertaining picture. But even if all those are well put into place, it can't make up for the missing depth that one expects from The Showman.Now Prem Rog aims to tackle several social themes, among which the most prevalent is widow remarriage, but it's hard to take it seriously when many of the situations are convoluted, melodramatic, while some of the key characters are mere caricatures. One wishes the whiny background music in the crucial scenes was not there. What's more, the legendary director, probably in order to ease it for the viewers, makes ferocious attempts to overpower this serious issue with some fluffy romance, thereby taking away from the seriousness of the situation.Prem Rog is pretty Padmini Kolhapure's film all the way and it attempts to repeat her brilliant appearance in Kapoor's Satyam Shivam Sundaram, where she was innocence personified, and probably her raw performance in Insaaf Ka Tarazu (where she played a teenaged rape victim). Sadly, the innocence here is overplayed by the writers, but she rises above the script and is wonderful. It's pretty strange how quickly she lost her stardom following such a spectacular start with a string of both commercial and artistic successes.Rishi Kapoor gets a very common role for his doing and plays second-fiddle to his leading lady. He does really well, his disappointment early when the girl he loves gets married to another is convincing, and he is good support throughout, as are Nanda and Shammi Kapoor. Prem Rog is among Kapoor's weakest films, frankly, and it just feels like another Hindi melodrama. I'm not saying it's bad or unwatchable, it's Kapoor after all, but despite all its technical brilliance and how stunning it is to look at, it's not fully realised.\n",

            "I saw the film quite by chance and was laughing out loud within the first 2 minutes. But to say that the film is very funny is to understate the case. It works on several levels thanks to deft observations of character supported by superb ensemble performances. Ostensibly about a group of hopefuls in a talent contest it explores much more than what the narrative declares. We see and, more importantly, feel the emotional trajectories of several lives as they jostle for their place in the spotlight. Each has a special, individual reason for being there. But, in the course of the few days of the contest, we see how essentially the journeys (rather than the end result) change, even define, these lives. The separate (but interlinked) stories propel the film on the narrative level. But if \"Loins of Punjab Presents\" had limited itself to simply telling these stories it would have fallen into the genre trap of the \"feel-good\" film. It would then have been enjoyable but ephemeral. The greater, and more lasting, joy of the film is the manner in which it springboards off the several dramas to comment on a range of contemporary obsessions. In a genre that is weighed down by cliché and triteness, this film stands out for being fresh,warm and, happily, the right length.\n",

This 25 minutes spell is also the driest of all comic events that occur throughout the movie. However, if you can get past this part, you are certainly in for a treat.The movie only picks up after the poor start. The jokes get continuously better and funnier, and the situational comedy simply cannot be ignored. Some scenes are a pure laugh riot to those who enjoy clever and well-scripted comedy (as opposed to silly banter that most comedy movies these days are now filled with).The story ties up nicely, though I have to say that the portrayal of the ending could have been a little better. There is nothing wrong with the conclusion reached, but rather the way they approached it following the climax. Of course, the story was somewhat predictable, but the director still managed to keep it fresh.Acting was great as well. Some actors excelled, while others ranked merely above the line of mediocrity. For instance, Hritesh was excellent in his comic role. He truly has a knack for comedy. Ayesha, as always, portrays a sweet and innocent attitude such convincingly that you can't help but to be impressed by her. Rimi Sen, played her seductive role incredibly well, and keep note of her witty use of subtle facial expressions throughout the movie. Aftab didn't really stick out, but then again, his role was the most standard of all of them, and was also severely limited in the number of comic lines he spoke.All in All, the movie was highly enjoyable, so long as you don't focus on the few flaws. Of course, the movie isn't perfect, there are many things that could have been done better, cinematography and editing-wise that would have improved the movie, but it still served as a great Time pass, at the least. In conclusion, A Unique movie with a not so unique story.\n",

            "Woh Kaun Thi? is the first out of three Raj Khosla-directed thrillers starring Sadhana in the lead, the other two being Mera Saaya (1965) and Anita (1967). Actually, all three films have similar concepts and are all successful, although Mera Saaya is my favourite. The movie starts on one rainy night when Manoj Kumar's Dr. Anand while driving home meets a young, serious and awkward woman, whose image will chase him for a long time to come. The movie is high on suspense, and Raj Khosla handles everything very well. The script is tense, interesting and twisted, at times so much that there isn't a possible solution one would offer. The writers try to lead the audience to one particular prediction, but the movie is still highly unpredictable. I liked many of the film's scenes. The movie is aided by some melodious songs composed by Madan Mohan and sung by Lata Mangeshkar, it is technically well done and is generally well cast. While Manoj Kumar does well and is pretty decent as the confused guy, it is expectedly Sadhana who dominates this show with her beauty and ambiguity, successfully creating a mysterious, eerie character. The climax actually turns into an anticlimax which reveals all the secrets in one hit and is a bit too direct for my liking. I just felt everything was uncovered because there was no other way around. Clearly, the writers wanted to keep the mystery for as long as they could and then throw everything into one scene which clarifies it all within two minutes. But even then they failed to answer some substantial questions like how the car's wipers stopped and how Sadhana found the way visible through the car's front windowpane while the guy could not. This is a major plot hole and I wonder how the makers did not notice that. Anyway, Woh Kaun Thi? is still a memorable Raj Khosla thriller which was quite good for its time and is still worth watching today.\n",

            "Well where do I start. As a kid I loved this movie. I give it 10 to compensate for its poor rating of 4 where it languishes currently(it probably deserves a 6.5 tho) Getting back; what not does this movie have: a sinister palace(which was btw archaeologically excavated/discovered), roving spirits, rebirth, and the triumph of righteousness. Of courses some of the sub-plots in the story line are corny, esp. regarding the palaces' dark past but who cares.This movie was unique when it was made, a rarity in bombay cinema at that time. It has salman khan in the spankingly good form, and a plot to put 'the mummy' at shame. Okay not quite, but c'mon, it deserves credit for being bold, suspenseful, and so very appealing to a kids fantasy. I suggest people actually watch it before judging it by its rating here. And remember it was released in 1992, so don't expect a visual spectacle. Though considering that, you would be surprised to see how good it looks.\n",

            "Seems like these days everyone in Bollywood has a disability (mute-Teesri Aankh; deaf/blind/mute-Black; blind-Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai; mute/deaf/blind-Tom, Dick, and Harry) and now deaf/blind with Pyare Mohan. Thank goodness, though, that this time it's a comedy! Vivek Oberoi is deaf, and Fardeen Khan plays blind. Being a comedy, their acting is not meant to be realistic at all, but just funny, which it definitely is! Vivek and Fardeen's scenes are absolutely hilarious. I'd say this is one of the best comedies of 2006. Boman Irani's acting is as always impeccable. It doesn't matter that the story is very predictable--the comedy keeps you going! However, the climax just stretches it too far and doesn't go along with the rest of the film. Nonetheless, Pyare Mohan is enjoyable. Vivek gives a great performance after a long time (since Saathiya), and Fardeen is good too. Esha is good and looks great. Amrita's decent. Songs are not too bad. All in all, Pyare Mohan's a light-hearted, be it a bit over-the top, fun-filled comedy!\n",

            "How lucky can a master filmmaker get when the tide is against you smacking you & your new movie deliberately in the face? Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola certainly knows. This documentary, probably one of the most fascinating & insightful examinations into the craft of filmmaking and the creation of art, chronicles Coppola's three year odyssey filming the surreal Vietnam War epic \"Apocalypse Now\". Directed & narrated by his wife Eleanor, who accompanied her husband throughout the entire shooting of the film, this is THE most splendid \"making-of\" documentary I've ever seen. The finished version of \"Apocalypse Now\" that we've come to know is a strange, mystical journey - which probably evolved out of Coppola's own bizarre experiences while making the film.Most of these strange occurrences on the set of \"Apocalypse Now\" served to hinder the completion of the film. The fact that such a brilliant film was even salvaged from the wreckage that was Coppola's life at the time is a miracle, but the film also serves as a testament to the genius of Coppola that was already established with the massive success of the first two \"Godfather\" films. Plagued by constant typhoons, a mercurial Marlon Brando, an unreliable Phillipine army, a cast of actors whacked out on drugs & alcohol (especially the maniacal Dennis Hopper), endless financial woes, and Coppola's own self-doubt & inner demons (\"I don't have the movie yet!\"), there is no surprise in the eventual photo shown of an exhausted Coppola standing on the set of his film in a damp raincoat, pointing a revolver at his own head. This may be an experience other directors have experienced (many David Lean films were logistical nightmares), but how many directors can testify to enduring these types of repeated misadventures for three years, and still manage to find the light at the end of the tunnel?The entire cast is interviewed (years afterward) about the making of the film - except, of course, for Marlon Brando (Larry Fishburne doesn't get much screen time in the documentary, but his character was relatively small anyway). Martin Sheen, Dennis Hopper, and Frederic Forrest provide the most insight. Sheen & Hopper seem particularly direct at disclosing the grim nature of their excessive drinking at the time. Actors Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall, co-screenwriter John Milius, and the Coppolas themselves also reflect back on the construction of the film. The film is loaded with deleted scenes, extended takes, and much behind-the-scenes footage (Coppola angrily berates a stoned Dennis Hopper for forgetting his lines). Eleanor Coppola must really love her husband, because it takes a strong person to document - on film, nonetheless - three years worth of strife & turmoil as you watch your spouse in their craft, fearful they are creating the genesis of their own demise as an artist. A powerful, absorbing documentary on the creation of one of the greatest films ever made.\n",

            "Before moving on to the review, I would like to share my views on the three stages of a child's growth i.e., before the age of 12, in the teen years and later in the college post 16-17, as shown in our Hindi Cinema since the early era. Now a quite surprising yet interesting observation in this context is that where we can easily find many movies made around the first and third stages of this growth process, there we don't find enough attempted on the second one in Hindi cinema, which happens to be the most crucial stage depicting the adolescence years of a growing kid.Personally I feel, Raj Kapoor's MERA NAAM JOKER (1970) touched this particular subject, in the most sensitive & meaningful way ever till date (in its first part) because we still find the issue highly conservative, even in this present age of information quite ironically. Therefore when a first time woman director Sonam Nair, makes a film about these crucial years in the life of a chubby, honest & innocent girl Gurpreet Kaur, then for me, its unarguably a bold & innovative venture coming from our Hindi Cinema after a long time. Plus when further Sonam goes on to showcase many first-time scenes in her film (both visually and verbally) along with a well chosen cast & team, then the project certainly becomes even more important from that angel without any doubts.For instance, in the past when have you seen young girls talking about their physical developments on the screen in clear words or when there has been a screen mother assisting her daughter in buying her new undergarments, which she now needs for the first time in her young years. On top of all when have we seen an adorable divorced mother, attending her ex-husband's second (love) marriage ceremony along with her grown up daughter & son? Frankly that surely needs to be considered as a healthy sign of meaningful growth in our Hindi cinema undoubtedly and for this both Karan Johar (Producer) and Sonam Nair deserve their own individual praises, for sure.Incidentally, I did witness some weird restlessness in a certain section of viewers about this verbal & visual depiction of the realistic facts of adolescence on a personal level. So as an answer to that particular section of viewers who still consider it to be on the 'vulgar side', I wish to say that VULGAR is when you enjoy or dance on a song like \"Laila Teri Le Legi, Tu Likh Ke Le Le\", but it is not VULGAR when a mother is teaching her daughter how to dress differently dealing with her new body changes in the teenage years.Hence, from that viewpoint, GIPPY is an important film which at least draws your attention towards this extremely important phase in our child's growth, to be dealt with utmost care, patience and love. But at the same time, GIPPY is not a big classic film too, since it tackles (or just touches) all those issues on a very lighter note and remains entertaining throughout, well supported by some good performances and catchy music. In its 97 minutes of short duration, the proceedings never get sloppy and its script keeps providing you the enjoyable, exciting moments right till the climax. Honestly it's a Girls movie all the way, which is \"by the Girls, about the Girls & for the Girls\". So, all the women & girls out there are sure going to have a great time watching it together. Further it also takes you on to an emotional tour exploring the mother-daughter relationship in a splendid way, which indeed has been portrayed with great guts, conviction and respect, all together. The loving relationship gets a new meaning through a worth praising performance by Divya Dutta, playing the single mother taking good care of her growing kids and the film becomes a must watch just for her.The merits of GIPPI also include its catchy soundtrack (by Vishal- Shekhar) which has some youthful dance numbers such as \"Baby Doll\", \"Pehn Di Takki\" & \"We are Like This Only\" along with a melodious, well written track \"Mann Baavra\". Background Music keeps the tempo going and so does its cinematography capturing the hilly locations & school sequences competently.In the performance section, Riya as Gurpreet Kaur or Gippy plays her part quite impressively & effortlessly. Though at times she seems to be too casual in her approach but that in turn becomes a part of her on screen character as the film progresses. Arbaz and Doorva Tripathi as her best friends are truly natural and a delight to watch. Jayati Modi delivers what was required from her as the teasing girl. Mrinal Chawla and Aditya Deshpande are just fine but Taaha Shah acts well. In the grown-ups, as said earlier Divya Dutt gives one of her career best performances and Pankaj Dheer is good but Raqesh Vashisht hasn't got much to do in it.As a film, GIPPI made me feel good and it made me feel hopeful too about the future of Hindi Cinema, since we do have thoughtful minds here who can think out of the box with the changing times. The film has been made straight from the heart, has got a sweet warmth in it and a vision too pointing towards the way kids need to be treated equally. However it also made me think that probably Bollywood is really finding it hard to make anything without the reference of Punjab or Punjabi characters in it from the last few years.In all GIPPI is a like a fresh breeze in the mess of all stereo-typed films. It breaks the traditional shell of our society convincingly and after a long long time, Hindi Cinema gives us a worth watching film on school life, girls and adolescence.\n",

            "This film was very heartwarming and thought provoking, although the opening song was a bit drowsy and long! John Abraham is in fine form here, starring as a police detective who falls in love with a pretty but naive girl (who is protecting a little boy in her care) during a murder investigation gone awry. The storyline is solid until it reaches its mostly unbelievable climax! It's almost like the writer had a good idea for this very picturesque film, but halfway through lost focus! To me, its silly when writers or directors (and I've seen this especially in Bollywood cinema) try to make the actors forcefully send a message to the audience. It should be purely entertainment or left to the audience to decide what their point of view is. When it comes across as an opinion being forced on the viewer, it ruins the film and makes it subjective instead of objective. I don't want to give too much away but it is worth a watch! John Abraham is a total 'Paap' in this role, no puns intended!\n",

            "In films like \"First Love\", the rotund, gravel-voiced Eugene Palette used to do a great turn as a man who watches with detachment whilst his wife and offspring made fools of themselves. Eventually, his bottled up indignation would explode to good comic effect. In \"Biwi Ho To Aisi \" (roughly, \"a wife should be like this\") Kader Khan (or Kadar as he is credited here) is cast in the Eugene Palette role. He does a fine job of humouring his ill-tempered wife, whilst consoling her victims and confiding to the audience with direct-to-camera asides. Bindu, playing the domineering wife, roars round the house like a tornado, heaping high volume invective and scorn on all in her path whilst Salman Khan makes an energetic debut as a pop music loving teenager (in a sub-plot involving a deceitful girlfriend).Farooq Shaikh (here credited as Farouque Sheikh) shows again what a fine actor he is. His role calls for him to be submissive towards his mother, pally with his father, tender towards his adopted sister and romantic with Rekha. Their scene together, as they take refuge from the \"battle of the bindis\", is particularly sensitive.Rekha is at her best, playing a sort of Eliza Doolittle character. We see her first, dressed in a gorgeous South Indian costume, routing a village bully in an extended comic scene. Later, transplanted to the Bindhari household we see her circling her foe physically and psychologically; sizing her up during the battle of wills with Bindu. She also gets an opportunity to put her yoga training to good use in another action scene.The usual, final plot twist is here made all the more enjoyable for being so deliciously implausible. Altogether, very entertaining.\n",

            "The movie released in 1995, when there was a period for romantic movies released, such as Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Barsaat and others. This one was unique in the sense that it is a gangster type movie. The movie is about a farmer who moved to the city of Bombay with his family where he met a boy called Munna who had no-one and both started to become a gangster. Years later son (Rohan) follows suit as he takes over from his father and avenges for both Munna's and his father's murder. Rajnikanth, perhaps this was the last time he did a Hindi movie, ditched his style of \"throwing a fag to his mouth\" and rather performed a great role as Munna. The amazing performance was by Aamir Khan, who was not really old to play such a role, executed very well as a gangland boss. This movie would have been suitable for this decade, where movies such as Company by Ajay Devgan was made. However, it was not a bad movie, although perhaps Aamir Khan was not the suitable actor to play such a role at that time.\n",

            "Ne t'inquiete pas, personne n'est parfait. Nevertheless, this movie directed by Prem Soni/Prem Raj indeed had a rough production in 2012. Shot mainly on locations in Europe, at very great expense, the film suffer financial issues afterwards in post-production where they couldn't pay the crew to finish the film. To add to that problem, the director was also being treated for Cancer, so, nobody was unable to edit the movie. It got so bad, that the film got postponed multiple times before finally being released on 24 May 2013 with really bad editing cuts. You see examples of some, after the Eiffel Tower scene. To add insult, the film also couldn't find its target audience. It doesn't know, if it wanted to be, a French movie or a Hindu movie. More bad luck came when the film was unable to compete for audience against the Indian Premier League cricket finals held, during its opening weekend. So, nobody bother to go see it; and it slowly fell into obscurity. I just happen to catch the movie, on DVD at my local library. It looks somewhat interesting, so I decided to check it, out, even if I don't speak, a word of Hindi. Sadly, after watching it, I couldn't get eperdument amoureux with this Bollywood movie. The love story about two complete Hindi strangers, Akash (Rhehan Malliek AKA Gaurav Chanana) and Ishkq Elise (Preity Zinta), falling in love, after having met on a train from Rome to Paris, end up spending the evening together in the romantic city, was highly clichés. It really does nearly hit all the romantic tropes such as our lovers pretend to be engaged in order to solve a pointless exterior plot problem like going to a wedding, often with a set of elaborate rules and limitations for their relationship, adding family expectations, cultural traditions, or religious beliefs bring our lovers together or try to keep them apart, follow up by a stupid reason to break up, cue to the heartbreak cry in the rain, and last ditch run attempt to get one of the lovers, from leaving the city by transportation. I wonder, where I have saw that before. Oh yeah, many of other romantic movies, before this. The movie was highly predictable. The other problem with this film, is the lack of conflict. You would think, that the misunderstanding for reasons, why they couldn't be, together, would play out, more. After all, it really did seem like Ishkq wasn't going to commit to Akash's advances for a relationship after what her supposedly last boyfriend did to her. Instead, that part of the story, is never brought up, and the second half falls back to love montage routine, until the childish weak subplot about Ishkq having Daddy's issues come up, resulting in a very awkward ending, with her movie-star mother, Marie (Isabelle Adjani) having to solve it. It was a very weak climax. I also found it, very jarring that both of the lovers, were able to find each other, so easily, after separating the first night. You would think, they would have some trouble with that, since both of them, barely talk about their lives. I was really disappointed with the destiny metaphor. I was hoping the film would had a more 2001's 'Serendipity', feel to it. Much of that movie's charm and humor, comes from the fact, that both of these characters, barely miss connecting with each other & the conflict that comes with moving on, or staying still for a relationship. Instead, the movie was humorless, and somewhat creepy. It's weird to see Akash stalk her through Facebook, which, the movie doesn't establish her, having nor her, telling him, her last name, while Ishkq stressfully seem to move on. It also, weird to see Akash magically out of the blue, find out, where she lives, without establishing where she work, before this point in the film. It also puzzling that none of the clues, the film try to introduce, were used in, rediscovering each other. You would think, that note in the coffee store or the psychic bellow dancer, would play out, more. Sadly, it does not. There is a lot of loose ends. Secondly the narrative format of the voice over is quite confusing, as it seems like the movie-star mother is talking about fictional characters of her stage play, but it turn out to be about her real-life daughter's relationship with Akash, whom she happen to write a script call 'Autumn in Paris', way before they ever met. If that isn't bizarre enough, that includes, having fake scene where Akash and Ishkq act out scenes out of a fake movie, while being in a movie, where events happens between them, where there is no way, Marie could had known what was happening, like a made up scene in Rome with a Italian waiter. Also, if we're to believe that Ishkq told her, everything about her relationship with Akash, are we to believe, that her night was made by a magic dice, follow by a weird nightclub Hindi music video with characters like Ghostface from 1997's 'Scream', serving them drinks, and a wedding scene where actor, Salman Khan, randomly show up for a dance number. How would anybody in the right mind, believe that? Trust me, it's all strange like why Ishkq was wearing a random Harvard t-shirt in the end. It's also bizarre to see, how many people in France, speaks Hindi. I was really wishing for more fish out of water, type comedy, here with the Hindi trying to understand French cultures. Sadly, it doesn't. Instead, it relays on too many cheesy sound effects to get the unfunny jokes over. However, even with the weird parts, the main plot was blasé. Despite that, the acting in the film was fine for the most part, and the music was enjoyable. I just wish the movie could had been better. It was no coup de maître.\n",

            "Well, I may be wrong, but I thought this movie was throughout trying to make spoofs of films like Kal Ho Naa Ho and Bollywood in general. It was good at times with some really funny parts. For example, Suniel Shetty's character was especially hilarious as it brought out the emotional side of a big mafia don. However, as the movie progressed, the spoofs became less evident, and Shadi Se Pehle just turned into the movie it was spoofing in the first place. Songs were good. Everyone--Aftab, Ayesha, Mallika, Suniel, and Akshaye--gave awesome, hilarious performances! Plus, the young, vivacious cast added freshness to the film. Comedy is not top-of-the-line, but all in all, Shadi Se Pehle is a decent time-pass.\n",

I had for the integral part of the film been transported to those days of college and camaraderie when masti, emotions and the bond of friendship were all on a super high. A big thumbs up to director Tanushri for delivering so beautifully and taking me back to a walk down memory lane. The romantic scenes with the first kiss, the fire flies and the sky lanterns did create a fairy tale moment that every princess in our heart would leap to capture. The melody of Dil Aaj Kal will linger in my humming like forever. I loved the movie and would definitely keep a DVD of the same in my collection to revisit some scenes that created magic for me.\n",

The films fictional premise is a relief from the somewhat tiresome bollywood films that we have to bear that have a standard script and are not dependant on good acting ability.

            "Bollywood is witnessing a transformation, maybe slow but yes its there. At least we have the new kids on the block who are seriously attempting to defy the Bollywood standard formula. And thanks to the media and internet such movies are being watched and appreciated.Not getting much into the storyline, the movie shows from two perspectives. One from the underworld (Prashant Narayan) and the other from advertising agency executive (Arshad Warsi). Arshad Warsi was good trying to balance his character of various shades. Prashant Narayan - I noticed him in Chhal and surely he is the one to lookout for. He is Naseer and Om Puri rolled into one. Sandhya Mridul was obviously trying to shrug off her goody-goody image from the TV serials and Saathiya. Sadly she couldn't carry the character of police officer too well. Even the character's name Agni was a bit too heavy for her personality. Suchitra Pillai as Shalu was good. Perhaps Sandhya and Suchitra could have swapped their roles for effectiveness.If the role of Gangutai could have been changed to a male don and performed by a seasoned actor like Sayaji Shinde, it would have carried a greater impact. It was a bit hard to digest a female Mumbai don, otherwise Pratima Kazmi's performance was first-rate. Mahima Chaudhry's track in a special appearance as herself is interlaced well into the story. Songs are quite noticeable. Noteworthy to mention are Allah Ke Bande (by Kailash Kher) and Sajna (by Shibani). To be frank, it was the former song which compelled me to watch the movie. As the credits rolls we see a special word of thanks to Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino and Ram Gopal Varma - our director Shashanka Ghosh's obvious inspiration for abstract direction styles.The humour keeps the pace of the movie going. Actually its dark comedy - if you happen to enjoy QT movies then you will definitely like it and feel pleased that Bollywood is evolving.This movie could be a good pedestal for the director and we sincerely hope that is roped into one of biggie production houses. Roll on Shashank - we are waiting.\n",

            "David Dhawan is known for making comedies, though he started off with action films like Taaqatwar, Aag Ka Gola he shifted to socials with Swarg(1990) but got success with comedies, from Shola Aur Shabnam, Bol Radha Bol(1992). Don't expect logic in his films just entertainment. Another aspect he has made many films on is double roles,mostly creating confusion. Bol Radha Bol involves around a scam where a mistaken identity purposely replaces the original. The first half focuses more on love story between Rishi and Juhi which does have it's funny moments but it's the second half when the real confusion takes place, which mostly happened in 90s. The film also has some stupid scenes like Kader Khan's character who goes blind after 6'0 clock in evening but that was all forgiven in such films those days. The film released in 1992 when Rishi had another hit Deewana, in both films Sushma Seth plays his mother.Rishi Kapoor however by this time was around in his 40s and he was putting on lot of weight, looking misfit to play a romantic hero yet he went on playing a romantic hero even in late 90s. Direction by David Dhawan is good Music is good, Tu Tu Tu Tu Tu Tara became very famous, title song too is goodRishi Kapoor plays both the roles superbly, proving yet again that he is a fantastic performer, though his weight worked against him Also the SFX between both is downer, but that is forgiven for a 90s film Juhi plays her part well, as the gaon ki gori who later changes her style to fool Tony. Kader Khan is hilarious in his role which may not be sensible, but he always played such crazy characters. Alok Nath in a negative role is superb, Mohinish Behl is also as usual Sushma Seth is her usual self, Kiran Kumar is as usual, Shakti Kapoor proves some funny moments The rest including Arun Bali, Tiku Talsania and rest are okayTiku Talsania,\n",

Professor Chaudhry suffers from frequent bouts of forgetfulness. What looked like a case of absent-mindedness before appears to be turning into a serious illness.He forgets that he has retired, and reaches college only to discover it's a chemistry lecture. He has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that it has been one and a half years since he lost his dear wife. He loses it altogether when Trisha's potential father-in-law places an ashtray and used teacup on a newspaper issue, which has Mahatma Gandhi's photograph. The professor's condition completely deteriorates and he starts blaming himself for being the man accidentally responsible for Gandhi's assassination. So what is his condition? Alzheimer's? Dementia? Schizophrenia? Scientific definitions offered are plenty, but the root cause of this sickness is much more deep-rooted than it appears.

            "After going through two incidents which nearly put his life into danger, a simple rustic bullock cart driver named Heeraman takes two vows - to never carry again illegal goods and to never carry again bamboo on his cart. Then he is asked to transport a young nautanki dancer named Heerabai as a passenger to a distant village fair. Travelling together for over forty hours, a true bond of friendship is formed between the two. They share some life experiences together and sing some wonderful songs to each other. She is charmed by his simplicity, innocence and his unsophisticated perception of life, and he is mesmerised by her beauty and honesty. This sequence is the film's most interesting and beautiful, but what follows next is what carries the narrative forward and leads the story towards Heeraman's third vow, and the viewers clearly can predict it.A wonderful and musical drama, Teesri Kasam tells a simple story of cultural clashes and unrealised love. It is a rather captivating watch, well directed and narrated, and is aided by fantastic performances. Raj Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman are absolutely outstanding in their roles. Kapoor's character in this film is not an unusual one in his career given he often played roles of this sort (the overly innocent romantic fool) but his performance definitely is. The way he displays Heeraman's sincerity, fear, love and ultimately his realisation is terrific. Rehman is unsurprisingly excellent as Heerabai - the strong, dignified and talented dancer. Her dance numbers were well done, but it is the depth with which she conveys Heera's feelings and her inner devastation that marks this performance. Needless to say, she is as beautiful and graceful as always.For this film, Shankar-Jaikishen composed another winning soundtrack. \"Duniya Banane Wale\" is my favourite song and is soulfully performed by Mukesh. This is also the number that makes Heera call Heeraman her Guru, one of the top moments showing their spiritual connection. The film's final scene is unquestionably the most haunting and memorable in Teesri Kasam, and it is the one which brings the third vow to its ironic fulfillment. Heerabai's honest confession and Heeraman's silent reaction create a melancholic ending that tugs at the heartstrings. I was surprised by how moved I was by the conclusion of the story. This is actually the moment that marks this film and bears the stamp of its greatness. I highly recommend you to watch this classic picture. Take a bow, Kapoor, Rehman, and Basu Bhattacharya.\n",

            "Its film's like these which tell you that movie-making in the land of bollywood is headed in the right direction...After a myriad of movies with glam star cast and no storyline, here's a movie which has got its priorities right. With a strong storyline and crisp film-making, Thanks Maa is a touching tale based on a relationship which most take for granted-- mother and child. The beauty of the film lies in the way it highlights the issue of abandoning infants, using ironies found rampant in our daily lives. At times the reality it portrays seems a bit too harsh to believe, but overall, the issue is handled beautifully, without making judgements or imposing moralities. Wonderful performances by Shams and his cronies. (The National Award well deserved in his case.) Superb settings, amazing cinematography. There are moments which the movie could have done without, but then again, it might also have to do with the fact that most scenes and settings shown in the movie are stuff that we, who live above the poverty line, will never have seen or imagined. With settings like these it is easy to often fall prey to stereotyping, but thankfully, Thanks Maa has stayed clear of such mistakes. The dialogues are a little too harsh at times, but emotions run high and its easy to feel for the plight of the children. Maybe a little shaky on the technical front, but overall, this movie is a must watch...\n",

Bhumika Chawla's character definitely seemed to have a mental problem as one minute she's about to kick Rahul Bose out of her house and the next she wants to have one last intercourse \"for old time's sake.\" That's when you know it's time to give up on this movie. Then comes Tabu as the film's last, desperate effort to somewhat satisfy anyone who is still watching this movie. Tabu's story actually has depth to it. As always she acts excellently making all the other stars in the film look lame. However, I still don't get what is up with her stepson making intimidating, erotic calls to her.

            "Aatish was way ahead of its time, in terms of execution. In terms of story line it may have been a rehash of John Woo's A Better Tomorrow but technically it is one of the best to come out of Bollywood, and definitely one of the most stylish. It introduced quite a few things in terms of the technical aspect.Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon and Aditya Pancholi are perfectly cast.Truth be told it is a fairly successful movie but could have done better at the box office had it got the cast right. Atul Agnihotri and Karisma Kapoor are completely miscast. So is Shakti Kapoor. Debutant director Sanjay Gupta in his effort to give equal screen space to all goofed up big time. The 'Ya Dilruba' number is a perfect example of this goof up. The perfect chemistry between Dutt and Tandon is lost amidst close-ups of Agnihotri and Kapoor.Agnihotri didn't have the personality to stand up against Dutt. Mind you, the film is a face-off between the two. Had the former been consigned to a bit part, like Mehul Kumar cleverly did in Krantiveer - allowing the formidable Nana Patekar to take centrestage - it would have been okay. Alas it wasn't the case. In what was meant to be a serious role Agnihotri looked (and acted) comical.Besides, when you are making a big budget, stylish film, your antagonist has to have style. While Gupta got it right giving supporting parts to Ajit saab - an epitome of style and class - and even Gulshan Grover, he got it wrong with the main villain. Shakti Kapoor doesn't belong to this ecosystem, lacks class and comes across as cheap and petty. You can put him in an earthy, rustic film (Tohfa, Raja Babu, Gunda etc) but not one that is classy and elitist.The movie also got it wrong as regards the selection of songs. While the album has eight songs in total, the three most hummable, 'Baarish Ne', 'Bolo Kahaan Gaye The', and the power-packed ditty 'Hasratein Hain Bahut Magar' don't find a place in the movie. Instead the director was happy with average numbers like 'Aa aa meri Janiya' and 'Kaash Tum'.With three of the six principal characters seemingly out of place, you have lost half the battle. And the best songs, that could have helped control the damage, were also absent. This is what happened with Aatish. What could have been among the year's top three hits was relegated to outside the top 10. Still, it remains one of Dutt's best (albeit underrated) works, and most certainly Pancholi's best.\n",

Nadeem Shravan's timeless music  indeed takes less time for the viewer to reach the exit door with a painful song popping up every now and then. An extra 'r' in the title  justifying Kareena's overdone facial expressions, very very unnatural.The movie starts with a very unappealing pair of obese kids swearing undying love and singing songs (in their age I was unable to recite even nursery rhymes). But then rich girl poor guy, so father fumes and love doesn't bloom. Years later  Enter Tusshar with a living-in-India, dancing-in-Paris song. Enter Kareena with a living-in-Paris, praising India song. Both are in search of each other. But why the hell do they insist on sticking to their childhood love, unseen for years. What if she would have turned into a tun-tun and he into a Gabbar singh? Post interval they meet and sing more songs. But daddy still ain't cool and fires shots. The highly clichéd bhagwan-ka-chamatkar end, where Tusshar gets back life appears most ridiculous. In between the story is also stuffed with several unconnected sub-plots, like a tight-pant veejay's (Mallika Sherawat) one-sided love affair, an angry old Alok Nath, a turban headed Satish 'Sardar' Shah(again) and a Kader Khan going philanthropic ways.The story lacks freshness, direction lacks impact, Tusshar lacks Star looks, Kareena lacks acting ability and even the dupatta song lacks a dupatta. Also imagine, the title song is pictured in a disco.Kareena's dressing sense is pathetic and in between she's also seen in a Saree. Yes, a Saree. The movie essentially bears a Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai hangover, which is evident not only in it's cast and crew but also with those similar outdoor locations, song picturizations, Kareena's dupatta song and Tusshar roaming on hill tops with haver-sacked shoulders. Finally Mujhe Yeh Kehna Hai, that miss it under all circumstances\n",

            "When a director is given the responsibility of launching a fresh pair with the hero coming from one of father-figure families of the Film Industry then he should at least try to deliver something fresh in the name of concept or treatment, to make the best of the opportunity given. But sadly, just opposite is the case with LEKAR HUM DEEWANA DIL, which clearly indicates its flawed vision when a Rahman song is first wasted in its opening credits only and further when its story progression keeps jumping from one plot to another like a blind frog not knowing where it should actually move towards in the dark room.So displaying a confused mindset, director Arif Ali refuses to take some risk adapting any novel concept for the debutants and begins with his own tribute to JAANE TU YA JAANE NA (2008) in the film's initial moments, followed by a mixture of ideas taken from his brother Imtiaz Ali's SOCHA NA THA (2005), JAB WE MET (2007) and even HIGHWAY (2014), quite casually. At first it also reminded me of Sachin's PREM DEEWANE released in 1992 featuring an eloping couple. But changing tracks, the director soon goes back to the ages old theme of post (love) marriage misunderstandings, seen in numerous movies ranging from Rajesh Khanna's AVISHKAAR(1974), Rakesh Roshan's PRIYATAMA (1977) & Shaad Ali's SAATHIYA (2002) to Shahrukh Khan's CHALTE CHALTE (2003), delivering a pretty routine, boring and childish film targeting the youth of the nation in particular.To give you a fair idea about the script's intelligence quotient, it has a father hitting his college going boy with a fist as if he has done a crime and then the boy also willing to hit his girlfriend in the same manner (showing his fist) like a maniac. Later a marriage counselor seems more disturbed than her patients sitting on the couch and wait, we also have an item song here right within the jungle hideout of Naxalites having some funny lyrics saying 'Mawaali Qawwali'. With no detailing given to the lead characters, they both remain hyper throughout the film with their constant yelling and look silly taking many crucial decisions of life just like that (including their hasty marriage). Having nothing in store to surprise you right till its easily predictable climax, LHDD actually makes you think that did nobody read this script in the Kapoor family at all before launching one of their own kids. Or it was just formality done by Karishma Kapoor as an elder sister accompanying Armaan on Kapil's Comedy Show contributing in the film's media promotion.In the music department A.R. Rahman comes up with an average score once again with very few enjoyable songs saving the soundtrack from becoming a complete non-performer and DOP tries his best to give it a rich look. However regarding the performances where Armaan should always thank his lucky stars and God gifted family for the golden opportunity given, there Deeksha can still hope for some more work ahead due to her satisfactory act much better than Armaan. Supporting cast remains a mix of average to forced performers revealing another aspect of the director's questionable mindset wherein he still thinks that a South Indian father always has to be the one with a dark complexion.Summing up, I would like to address the viewers here, who eventually would be spending both their money & time on such poor ventures made without any specific vision. And in clear words, if you really are willing to see some fabulous films made on this important subject of an affair, love marriage and the problems arising in its later years post the initial romantic phases. Then forget about any of these confusingly made films without any soul of their own and just go for the famous trilogy on marital discord by Basu Bhattacharya made in the 70s comprising of three beautiful films called ANUBHAV (1971), AAVISHKAR (1973) and GREH PRAVESH (1979).In other words, if today film-makers in Hindi Cinema are not giving you many worth watching films to learn from then all is not lost yet as there are much better movies made in the past to be explored essentially and some great visionary work being done in the regional cinema of the country too which remains hidden due to our own short vision and limited access. So stop being fooled by all these routine projects made to serve the demanding market packaged in an impressive style and move towards the actual cinema, which you all have been missing since long.\n",

            "Well, first, I enjoyed this film - I liked the realistic portrayal of the modern-day urban India of the 1980s, I immensely liked the background score, the cinematography, the dialogues. But I totally HATED the unrealistic concept of an entire nation going crazy about one simple man without a completely justified reason and considering him their God. What I found even more laughable is that when he wants to go, they sing a song for him. It was so clichéd that I lost any interest in the film. I don't get why good stories must go to unnecessary edges. The entire story revolves around this admiration. Anyway, Amitabh in one of his better performances of the 1980s, is great, and Shabana Azmi, who is beautiful and as always natural, provides great support. Go for it if you like - I see why the film is widely appreciated, but I frankly don't find it underrated as many people here say.\n",

Released in 1970, this movie went on to cause a stir as did the music as it was considered to be beyond its time.Two brothers,Sohan and Mohan, both studying in the same school, have entered the school boxing competition. When the final comes it the two brothers find out that they are fighting each other. Sohan is declared winner but the match is continued at home and the mother tells them that they should wait for their father. Mohan, the elder, being impatient, goes to see his father - a police officer. Instead he witnesses a smuggler by the name of Heera murdering his father. He then tries to catch him by chasing him and lends up hiding in his car.Years pass by and Sohan becomes an Police inspector and wanting to catch smugglers, he lands himself in a cell with the man who had murdered his father, Heera and introduces himself as \"Johnny.\" He later escapes and meets up with a contact that he had been informed about by Heera - a female by the name of Rekha.The movie stars the ever green Dev Anand, Hema Malini, Pran, Premnath, Ifteqar and I.S. Johar. The story is good but more than that is the direction by the late Vijay Anand. But the acting by all and especially the comic side by the late I.S. Johar, is absolutely brilliant. The songs to listen out for are \"O Mere Raja,\" \"Baabul Pyaare,\" \"Nafrat Karne Waaloh\" and \"Parbhal Keliye\" - they are most memorable as is the music by Kalyanji - Anandji.I recently saw this movie after a very long time and was in tears as it brought back floods of memories and especially especially childhood ones.

            "*this review contains no spoilers* I went to watch Road to Sangam only knowing that it was a film with a connection with Gandhi and had won some awards. What transpired on the screen in the next 135 minutes changed my perception of Gandhi and changed me as a person. I am some one who did not regard Gandhi in the high esteem a lot of people regard him in. He, to me, was some one who was adamant and threatened the nation with his blackmails which were carried out promptly by his followers. What I did not understand was that it was the power of Gandhi's thoughts which made people act the way they did. It had reason, it had logic.Coming to the film. We are given a rationale and the film makes a strong case for it. You almost start believing in the thinking behind it. Then, there is a slow process of change which is so slow and gradual. It is not some thing which happens right away or through a flash bulb of genius. It is realization in process. The way the change is shown is convincing enough for some one to believe in the Gandhian principle.The film has many layers to it. It is a film which asks 'what defines Karma'. It is a film about holding upright the faith Gandhi showed in the muslims of India. It is a film about how a person be it a Muslim or a person of any religion (or even an agnostic or atheist for that matter) should behave. That's the bigger picture.Then the film touches on tough subjects like partition and the role of an Indian Muslim. Many layers and subjects touched, all given due space.Paresh Rawal is excellent in the role of a man who works based on logic and is principled at the same time. I can't think of a better actor to carry out the role. The part of a Muslim from the state of Uttar Pradesh, perfect with the local accent, who has his own little mannerisms and characteristics is played perfectly. The facial expressions are not exaggerated. The lines are spoken with a calm balance about them, exactly how the character would say it.The pace of the movie is neither fast, nor slow. It has it's own rhythm and flows rather than moves. The cinematography is excellent with aspects of small town India (the city Allahabad in this case) shown. There are panoramic views and then there is attention to detail. A man making aloo tikki is shown for instance to capture the flavour of the chaat which is so popular in small town India.Coming to Gandhi films, I have seen quite a few. Gandhi was a great biographical sketch. Gandhi My Father shows the flaws of Gandhi - the father of his son. Lage Raho Munnabhai which was so popular tries to explain the Gandhi way of thinking and does a fair job of it. It has the bollywood masala mixed in it, was perfectly marketed and was a huge success. Gandhigiri became a trend. Sardar, again starring Paresh Rawal (as Sardar Patel), paints Gandhi as a principled, yet stubborn man whose will might have cost India There are umpteenth movies which are presented as documentaries on Gandhi, most of which are holistic. No movie portrays Gandhism, like Road To Sangam does. At least none I have seen.The show I went for was almost canceled as only one other person showed up at the ticket counter. In the end, just five of us came to watch the movie which they did screen thankfully. One engineer who had studied from Allahabad itself remarked that Gandhism is dead as no one turned up for this movie. I remarked that Munnabhai was a huge success. So it is a marketing flaw and lack of funds which meant audiences didn't come to watch this film. There is another aspect to it. It isn't a masala flick like many other bollywood flicks or like Munnabhai. It is not boring in any way, mind.I give the movie a perfect 10/10. Don't think it could have been made better.I just hope more people see it. So go see it and spread the word!\n",

It's action -orientated and it's designed to make you go \"Wow!\" The cinematography is awe-inspiring.The soundtrack is epic.The introductory shots for the 2 leads and the negative male are truly memorable.The director Kamal Sadanah and the producer Abis Rizvi make a joyous cameo appearance and the trick of getting the audience to stay until the very final credit is taken care of by revealing a few tricks of the trade.Of course this won't please everyone - it's going to divide opinion - but what in life doesn't?! Personally - i'm all for people stepping out of a comfort zone and pushing the boundaries. Creating something that exists, that materializes purely from an idea.Roar is a first-time director's vision, opening your eyes to something new.\n",

            "I was expecting SBG3 to be a complete turd, and only went because a friend insisted on us seeing it. There are occasionally interesting moments, mainly because of the returning actors - Jimmy Shergill and Mahie Gill - who are comfortable in their roles even if by now the characters have become cardboard conspirators instead of the more nuanced personas of the first film. These are mixed with heaped helpings of non-sequitur and unintentional hilarity. Sanjay Dutt looks like age, plus a lifetime of booze and hedonistic living have addled his brain to the point he has a perennial slur (or perhaps he was drunk throughout the shoot). Chitrangada Singh is seen as a second-fiddle nautch girl character whose accent suggests she studied her mujra craft at Cambridge, or perhaps Yale. Other characters come and go with less-than-basic regard to continuity and coherence, like no one thought to do a second draft on the script or perhaps even wrote it up as they shot on set.Apart from the leads, the film's casting seems to have been decided based on a \"Kahan gaye woh log?\" Bollywood trivia quiz so you have appearances from Kabir Bedi, Nafisa Ali and Deepak-fricking-Tijori.\n",

            "This is an indian movie. Indian movies are a 3 hr mix of action, drama, humor, and musical. This may seem long. But if a movie is as good as Roti Kapada Aur Makaan, you will not notice it. This movie has some of the greatest actors of the indian cinema. A lot of social and political issues are being portrayed, which even after 26 years haven't changed that much. But if you do not like the moral tone in the movie there is enough action to keep a lot of you satisfied. One special relationship (in the movie) has to be mentioned. The oldest brother of one very poor family (the main character, Manoj Kumar) is the one with a degree, but is not able to get a good job. On the other side is his younger brother (my favorite, Amitabh Bachchan) who earns his money a little bit illegally and as a consequence gets judged and punished by his brother. So Amitabh decides to go join the army to make amends.This is really fun to watch. Although Amitabh hasn't got a very big part, he really steals the show. Oh yeah there is a lot of romance going on, but it never gets boring. Watch it!\n",

            "A first of its kind of attempt in Indian Cinema,TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO reminded me of a more than two decades old English Classic with the title WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT which came in 1988 and won 3 Oscars for its excellent achievements in visual effects and editing. TKS is also made on the similar lines where a human character is deliberately pulled into the World of CARTOONS and then is forced to help them in their problems. The film revolves around a fictional setup where in various cartoon characters living in their Toon-world are interacting with a human figure and the images on the screen are a mixture of both cartoons and real actors talking to each other.No doubt the producers of this path breaking Indian venture deserve all the praises for putting their money in this risky and out of the box project. But unfortunately the end result is not worthy enough of fetching them any good returns for their heavy investments made. And the conclusion arises because the experience of watching TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO is like hanging on to a pendulum which keeps swinging between two extremes constantly.At one end the film is simply superb in its technical department with visual graphics matching up to the Hollywood standards which can easily be considered as a great achievement by everyone involved in its visual effects team. But on the other end, TKS is complete disaster as far as entertainment factor is concerned. The film falls flat in its script department as the writers are not able to hold the viewers attention throughout its short duration, which is not what you expect from an animation film.In straight words, I would like to ask a question here that basically for what target audience an animation film is made for? The answer obviously comes as 'for all the kids and the kids hidden in the hearts of all age groups'. But while making TKS, the makers probably forgot this basic rule of the genre and just kept focusing on the technicality involved in the graphics section of the project. As a result the film turned out to be a bad experience both for the kids as well as for the adults young at heart. In fact I myself saw the few kids in the theater teasing their parents restlessly instead of watching the animated characters moving on the screen. And that was more like witnessing an instant review of the movie sitting right there in the theater. Hence as an animation film made for the children, TKS fails to hit the bulls eye but as a technical project, its indeed a brilliant and brave attempt from its creative team of animators.If only Kireet Khurana, the director, had taken more care of the content than the execution, the project could have been the talk of the town this Christmas. The second half of the movie is much better than its first as it has many interesting developments and games taking place in the narration. But then again the hurried up climax, leaves a bitter taste in the end and you feel like leaving the theater as soon as possible. Actually an animation movie mainly works when anyone of its cartoon images successfully makes an immediate connection with the kids watching it. But in TKS, the writers are not able to establish any emotional connect with the viewers and therefore no one falls in love with any of the cartoon characters shown on the screen.Performance wise it's Ajay Devgan's film all the way, surrounded by many watchable animated characters seeking his help. Ajay does a real good job in the movie since its not an easy task to emote to just blank curtains with position marks made on them for your eye contact. And Ajay passes the difficult challenge with distinction. Kajol, as the mother has got nothing much to do in the film, so she cannot be blamed for anything. But other than the lead pair, the real stars of TKS are its animated characters such as Bolly, Guppy and their creators behind the screen who must have spent thousands of hours in order to present them so perfectly. Musically the film gets only an average score from Anu Malik, wherein I didn't find any special catchy song especially composed for the kids. However the art direction flawlessly serves the demand of the subject as required.In the end, I would like only like to add that TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO is just like a half baked cake, whose base has been baked to perfection but the top remains completely flavourless. So you can make your own choice if you really want to taste it\n",

Weird thing is, Akshay is unusually thin and much younger looking here, which made me doubt whether this movie was made many years ago and released this year.even his do is the old one. Sridevi's overacting is cloying as well as the the terribly role given to anupam kher, with his buck teeth looking as real as his tropical forest wig. Worst part is that just when u think movies in India are surely on their way up, one like this makes u want to swear off bollywood forever.

Maybe with Unknown you won't feel let down at the end of the movie like you will with Acid Factory- because Unknown was a terrific movie!!!

            "We, in Denmark, began daylight saving today – March 28, 2010. What this basically means is that our clocks will now be set to an hour ahead. It is curious how this day coincided with my viewing of Shyam Benegal's 'Suraj ka saatwa ghoda' (The seventh steed of the sun) last night. Based on a Hindi novella by the same name by Dr. Dharamvir Bharti's, the movie starts with Raghuvir Yadav introducing us to a few afternoons from his life where he knew a man called Manek Mulla (Rajit Kapur in his debut venture). Manek, we are told, was a master story-teller. A man who could blur out the distinct lines between reality and fiction purely by his talent at peppering his tales with metaphors aplenty. Working with the railways department, Manek had acquired the knack of keeping the three young men (of which Yadav is one too) occupied during lazy afternoons with his tales of love, deception, social imbalance and immorality within the lower middle classes of India.So, with this premise, a question is thrown – 'Should love stories be built at being relevant to the socio-economic growth of a society?' A bizarre, albeit thought-provoking, reference is made to the literary importance of 'Devdas' where, Manek says, there is no room for any sort of social relevance or optimism towards love as a public emotion. A definition, he claims, is what makes love so wonderful. Its lack of being a private, mysterious and almost forbidden concoction. So, in an effort to tell a tale of love lost connected with the complex fabric of social strata, he starts speaking of Jamuna. He speaks of how he was in school back then and Jamuna, the attractive next door girl, was in love with Tanna, another neighborhood fellow. Jamuna's and Tanna's love story was dated given the venomous relationships the two families shared due to lack of consistency in the Indian economic balance. As a result of this, Tanna is married off to a more educated Lily and Jamuna ends up with an old man knocking on the door of his grave.As you might have realized, there is nothing new or refreshing with this piece. What starts making this short story more interesting, is the way Manek describes his role in it and carefully begins to uncurl the tiny strands that were knotted during the narration of the aforementioned tale. For instance, the fact that Jamuna is unable to conceive from her old-man husband and so chooses to go on a bizarre religiously aligned but emotionally maligned detour with the tonga-wallah is brought to surface. Also, the fact that the girl Tanna ends up with – Lily – actually was Manek's love/friendship interest and how a mutual separation was finalized in both their interests is unearthed. Connected to this colorful mix as well, is the story of Tanna's lusty father (Amrish Puri in a truly memorable role as Mahesar Dalal) and his wile desires towards the lowly gypsy-woman Satti (Neena Gupta) who befriends Manek purely for his intellectual skills. Her eventual fate against an adamant Mahesar Dalal and the decisions young Manek makes form the twisting portions of the climactic sequences. All of these is documented from various angles aimed at the same scene. So, it isn't so much that Manek is narrating different short stories but essentially narrating just one story but from the perspectives of various characters in them. In some of them, the characters seem like the victims, while when seen from the view of another person's tale, the same character in the same scene will suddenly appear to have acquired some gray shades. Shades one would see in a predator. Truly – if a movie can accomplish this level of intellectual worth, then it has truly defined itself as the best example of cinema.What makes this movie greater in its worth is the fact that such a unique feat was written by Dr. Bharti in the 70s and narrated by Benegal in early 90s! Today we sit in awe at the intermingling of multiple stories in Hollywood and, of course, in their remade versions within Bollywood, and applaud them as being 'masterpieces'. But to compare this work to any of these would be nothing short of a huge disservice. In fact, I would call 'Suraj ka...' a work of meta fiction which successfully attempts to expose the fictional aspect of the illusive world woven by Manek Mulla.I also read some reviews that compared Manek's character to that of the holy trinity in Hindu mythology – Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar – and as to how he slips into these roles, albeit with varying degrees of subtlety. In the first tale with Jamuna, Manek is Brahma, the creator of a relationship that he knew was meant to be doomed. In the second tale with Lily, he became Vishnu, the preserver of her sanctity and an upholder of a more mature and practical relationship. In the final tale with Satti, he turned into the destroyer – Maheshwar – who ended up putting an end to what could have possibly been the redeeming factor of his life. I suppose it is in spectacular interpretations like these, that 'Suraj ka...' stands out as a truly unique piece of work.\n",

            "First things first ....I really enjoyed this movie!!! This is basically a comedy based on the lives of two married couples and the numerous marital and extra-marital goings on that happen with these two couples. One could call it a mix of Life in a Metro with Pyaar ke Side Effects...... unfortunately the promotions on TV has not given potential audiences with this impression.The four leads are impressive. Soha Ali Khan has become matured into a little dynamo of an actress, good things come in small packages. Although I must say that i did not really like her with the short hair in the latter half of the movie. Konkona, one of my favourite actresses, is as always wonderful. She has captured the essence of the character and her dialogue delivery and timing is top notch....there are times in the movie that I am sure the audience had no choice but to be reminded of an ex girlfriend or dare i say it their wives!! Rahul Bose is back to form with this one although he has done this style of acting before in Pyar ke side effects. Irrfan Khan has officially become the SRK/AmirKhan/Salman Khan of the parallel cinema world ( if we can call it that now). He gives a wonderfully natural performance that endears him to the audience although we may not condone his actions in the movie. His dialogue delivery and timing in certain scenes make you really laugh out loud. His performance is probably the one that stays with you after you leave the cinema.There are a number of small but wonderful supporting performances in this movie as well but I have to mention two in particular : Saba Azad and Payal Rohatgi. The former is an unconventional beauty but she sparkles with her screen presence and wonderfully natural dialogue delivery. The latter 'item girl' is slightly grating on the nerves with her screeching but then we are not supposed to like her anyway as per the demands of the role. I still feel that she had the funniest sequence in the file. PLease take note of the 'dumb blonde' like scene at the party.Kudos to the director, script writer and also to the dialogues writer since they managed to deliver a tight, taut film that does not flag at all after the interval. Nor does it veer off into melodramatic saga a la Karan Johar's KANK. ALso a special mention to the song from Rahet Fateh Ali Khan, the man has magic in his throat.There may be only one downer to the whole experience as some of the topics like sex and extra marital affairs would not be condoned by the family audience (hence a rating of only 7) but no one can deny that things like this are happening daily in todays metropolitan cities\n",

            "An avid lover of English movies must be well familiar with the fascination Hollywood has towards stories based on Dead Persons, Ghosts, Spirits or People coming from the unknown world. Walking on a similar path Bollywood's Hum Tum Aur Ghost also falls in the same category getting its main inspiration from the famous movies \"Ghost Town\" (2008) & \"Ghost\" (1990). But unfortunately, it remains just another mediocre inspired movie on an exciting subject which completely fails to impress the viewer from any angle.Talking about a fashion photographer who is able to see and talk to dead people, the movie starts off in a very lethargic manner, which takes the viewer by surprise since it was more publicized as a comedy featuring Arshad Warsi, better known for his incomparable comic timing. In fact that's the biggest slip-up made on the part of its publicity campaign, which mainly gave out the idea of it being a different laugh riot dealing with the dead, where as in reality the movie had nothing to be referred as Comedy. In the recent past, we have seen many projects being rejected due to their wrong publicity campaign and HTAG becomes the latest victim of the same.A simple question in this respect would be that \"Why to cut promos showcasing Arshad's comic skills, when he is doing nothing of that sort in the whole movie?\" And as an answer to that, it's a pure indication of trying to fetch some extra initial in the opening weekend with a deliberate and faulty kind of publicity campaign.Content wise, the pre and post interval impact of the movie is pretty same with nothing exceptional or worth enjoying happening on the screen. All the scenes dealing with the dead people seeking help from Arshad are treated very unexcitingly. The various stories about the past happenings with the ghosts have got nothing new to offer to the viewers. Furthermore, the movie ends with an entirely bizarre sequence (about the identity of a small boy), which even tempts you to find out who the actual writers are, responsible for this weird thought incorporated in the climax. In reality, the writers seem to be absolutely gone out of ideas in the entire screenplay as there is not a single enjoyable scene in the whole movie. It just ends as it starts without caring to provide any sort of entertainment to the viewers.However the only refreshing element in it remains, the gorgeous Diya Mirza who pleasantly looks very charming, lovable and cool in her well chosen dresses and also comes up with a decently performed act of a fashion magazine editor. Otherwise, HTAG is a perfect example of a huge ensemble of talent wasted in a messy way. Arshad Warsi sincerely tries hard to present a make believe kind of act, but does not get the much needed support from the script. Boman Irani is excellent as the needy ghost and Sandhya Mridul is immensely confident as always. But Javed Sheikh, Shernaz Patel and Tinnu Anand have nothing substantial written for them to perform.Technically the film shines bright with its noticeable camera-work and art direction. But musically it is not capable of creating any ripples in the market. Shankar Ehsaan Loy have delivered only a routine soundtrack for the movie, which has no melody in it. Director Kabeer Kaushik did show some sparks in his first venture \"Sehar\", but in his latest, he seems to be totally confused between different genres of Comedy, Drama & Horror. HTAG is no way close to any of his previous movies based on crime or may be the news of his clashes with the producers was in turn responsible for this half hearted uninteresting product from the director.\n",

            "'Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke' is an unwatchable film. The story is corny and filled with clichés, the writing is terrible, it is melodramatic, boring and completely uninspiring. I expected much more from a film starring Madhuri Dixit, Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta. The film starts with the characters of Ajay and Preity, two professional thieves who perform planned robberies. The character of Ajay appears to be Madhuri Dixit's character's deceased husband's lookalike and there starts the trouble when he enters her house on the day of his death. Yeh, complicated and messy it is. The film's saving grace may be Madhuri Dixit who delivers a sincere and natural performance. Ajay Devgan is completely unimpressive here, so is Preity Zinta, who is just okay and whose charm and vivaciousness seem to be missing in this act. Perhaps the most watchable sequence in the entire movie is the song \"Jo Pyaar Karta Hai\". It is a beautiful and moving song and the acting of the actors on-screen while they are singing it is convincing, particularly the contradicting moods of Zinta and Dixit, the former having sad and poignant expressions and the latter being happy and joyful. Anyway, this film is still not worth your time so you better spend it for a better purpose.\n",

            "Starting from Apradh(1972)as a director and actor, Feroze Khan who recently passed away was the flamboyant guy of the classic era(70s & 80s)of Indian cinema. He was greatly influenced by the action, glamor and adventure of western movies. Even in Apradh, he would film scenes (glamorous & murder in a bath tub) which were a far cry for those days Indian movies. He was definitely ahead of his time in getting closer to the western style/touch. He always choreographed good/hit songs bred with sensational music score and sometimes showing foreign artists/dancers in his movies. Qurbani (1980) was a block buster primarily due to the super hit songs.Janbaaz, a later day movie in the career of Feroze Khan was also a box office hit. With young, dashing and robust Aneel Kapoor to act as the prodigal Amar Singh, he got the right guy to portray the like of a spoiled scion of a powerful family. This spoiled young character had to face a suave and honest elder brother/police officer - Rajesh, beautifully played by Feroze Khan. As an affront cowboy like brother who sports hedonistic tendencies inherited from their pleasure seeking and rogue father (Amrish Puri), Amar would emerge as a contender between the sincere love affair of his elder brother -Rajesh and Reshma, played by versatile Dimple Kapadia.In all, the story is interestingly meshed up with the dons of underworld drug trade, a criminally lenient feudal father and a reckless younger brother....... the glamorous Dimple providing obscene pool and kissing scenes with a cameo appearance by Sri Devi and Rekha.Good entertainment and good songs. Indeed not boring to watch.\n",

            "Ajji is among the most realistic and superlative films of independent cinema in 2017. A gritty and authentic take on revenge genre, it has the merit to stand out on its own virtues. An extremely important film with an essential social theme, this movie deserves to be seen by everyone.PROS. 1. The screenplay of the film is impressive. Although not much things are happening on the screen, yet the film manages to stay intense from the beginning till the very end. 2. Performances of the cast are exquisitely amazing especially that of ajji. She should have won National award for her portrayal of this role. She submerges herself so much in the role that it becomes indistinguishable from reality. Rest of the film is also filled with powerhouse performances. If nothing else, this film can only be watched due to its performances. Easily on of the best acted film of the year...3.Direction is marvellous. Devashish Makhija manages to capture the raw emotion and intensity of the slums of Mumbai. His use of long shots are commendable, as they let the character to breathe and make a lasting appearance. He also manages to show the various trials and tribulations faced by the people of slum. The atmosphere created by him is incredibly intense and extremely authentic.4. Cinematography of the film is of top class. It manages to immerse you into the surrounding and helps to intensify the mood of the film. The film is easily among the most genuine portrayal of slum life in recent times.5. Powerful themes Revenge and justice are the main themes of the film. But other than that it also shades light on various issues like Rape culture, Biased judicial system, struggle between dignity and survival, Impotency of law, Flawed political system, Injustice faced by North Indians in Mumbai, Moral corruption etc...6. The mannequin scene This scene features during the middle of the film and easily one of the most nightmarish and trippiest scene of all time. This scene acts as an allegory for rape. It is a vile and cringe inducing scenes which also can be interpreted as the metaphor for feminine atrocity. The frequent use of mobile phone's camera during this scene escalates its frightening effect.7.Background score is minimal yet helps to sharpen the atmosphere of the film. Sometimes the music even conveys what's going inside the mind of the characters. Here music in not just an add-on but is used as an storytelling device, and the payoff is brilliant.CONS. 1. Slow Pace The film is too slow in its pace and even at just 105 minutes runtime feels a bit long.2. There are some scenes that defies logic. Like how ajji manages to sneak out every night without getting noticed by anyone? Mother of the victim is shown in no grief even after such a huge happening. So, all in all an incredibly well made film with passion and love for cinema. It's like a breath of fresh air. If you enjoy commercial cinema then there is nothing much here for you but if you are a true cinema lover do watch it. It's a must watch for everyone!\n",

            "I came across this film while flipping through the satellite channels one rainy Saturday afternoon, and left it on for a while because with over 357 channels, there was really nothing on. Bruce Springsteen needs to update his song.I don't know how many Americans are familiar with Bollywood movies, but I'm given to understand that most of them involve a man and a woman who fall in love and must overcome many obstacles in order to be together. Also as I understand it, there must always be a happy ending. We have our own clichés, like the monster in a horror movie must always show up for the sequel, no matter how dead it was before, or that cars must fly through the air during accidents. Me, I kinda prefer the happy endings. Indestructible monsters and cars bouncing around like ping-pong balls leave me cold.The movie itself was simple, straightforward, and predictable, but there was one thing it had that made me watch it again. That was the secondary female character, played by Neha Dubey. Throughout the movie she seemed attractive enough, but not especially so...and then she was called upon to dance in a musical number for the movie that was going to be made. For me, at least, she went from slightly attractive to jaw-droppingly, rock-between-the-eyes, can't-look-away stunning, all flashing eyes and brilliant smile and fascinating choreography. If I see that this movie is going to be on satellite again, I'll watch it again, just for that dance routine.\n",

            "Wow, what a masala (mix of spices)! This epic, if we can call it so, as it covers the full (short) lifetime of its protagonist \"Lucky\", from when his parents first met, to when he is finally buried... this movie has its good share of sometimes very silly comedy (the pop-eye headmaster, professor Liliput, even Shahrukh Khan comes over quite strangely, but sympathetic); romance at times very well done - but most of all it's a grabbing, poignant description of drug addiction and what tragical things it can do to people, demonstrated on the eradication of a once happy family. The earnestness of the message is driven home by the first closing title which reads: \"Hopefully THE END to drugs\" - of course, it wasn't.This was the last movie the popular comedian Mehmood directed, and reading Wikipedia on Lucky Ali, it appears that he had a very personal message to tell - to the cinema audience, but mostly to his son Lucky who was experimenting with Marihuana. Lucky refused to play the \"Lucky\" role, which his brother Manzoor Ali played instead, but started playback singing with \"Nasha Nasha\" in this film - a bizarre song & dance number of drug addicts.Mehmood himself plays goat-Baba, the scurrilous drug dealer - clad in green, with goat horns and a goat voice, he pushes his ware to young people, while repeatedly warning them... a bizarre person.If you want to see strong drama which can make your tears flow, I can strongly recommend this. But it also had the biggest laugh I ever got from a Bollywood movie - Lata acting as a hen... :^)The German title of the DVD is \"Ein kleines Lächeln\" (a little smile) - the grossest understatement! \"Feind der Welt\" (enemy of the world) would have been a correct translation of \"Dushman Duniya ka\".\n",

However, it is still watachable but the movie is 90% clichéd and there are too many plot holes. Zulmi was also another Akshay Kumar movie which flopped as his streak continued from 1997. Those days, he was a bad actor and his hairstyle changed in many scenes. First it was long hair from 1997 then it was short hair from 1999-later. The movie goes like this, Baba(Punneet Issar is a godfather who is having a party with all the family members and his bodyguard Balraj(Amrish Puri)who he likes more than his brothers. His brothers Jagawar(Dalip Tahil) and Bhaktawar(Deep Dhilion) have shots fired on Baba and before the godfather dies, he makes Balraj the godfather and the guardian of his dying son Nihal. Years later, we are introduced to Raj(Akshay Kumar) and his sister at the hotel eating food. When an unknown man kidnaps and rapes the sister, Raj goes to her rescue before she gets raped. Raj is beaten up after he wins by fighting them, he is left to die but before he becomes unconscious, he scratches the unknown man on the face trying to fight back. After, they leave, Raj finds out his sister dies and he leaves the place. He is heartbroken and upset. But, when he see's another situation like this, he fights the crooks and this time he succeeds. Balraj see's Raj's bravery and remember's himself as a child. Balraj hires Raj to become her daughter Komal's(Twinkle Khana's) bodyguard. After a few misunderstandings, both of them fall in love. Then, after a few family drama's and comic scenes. Balraj is shown as the hit-man as he is hunting Jagawar who has returned from jail with his broken leg(Balraj cripples him after the first party). Bhaktawar and Jagawar decide to kidnap Balraj's daughter and take revenge for his leg. But, Raj is a trained fighter(cliché) and he manages to rescue Komal and he does get shot on his hand in the process. Balraj is so proud of him and the next day asks him to marry Komal. Both agree and so does Komal. But, the twist is that Raj will try and kill Nihal who is Baba's grandson and Baba had promised Balraj to protect Nihal. Raj wants to kill Nihal because Nihal was that unknown man who raped and killed his sister. Then after all talking and Raj pretending to help Jagawar and Bhaktawar's death, the climax is formed. The climax is Nihal tries to kill Balraj but Jagawar kills Nihal and Raj and Balraj kill all of Jagawar's men and Jagawar. Nihal does in Balraj's hands and Raj forgives him and he says this is the repent towars his mistakes. The screenplay is definitely good, but the story is not well handled. Too many commercial ingredients and misunderstandings ruin the plot. Acting wise, Akshay Kumar stands out, he doesn't do his loud comedy. Amrish Puri excels in his role, Twinkle Khanna is excellent, Deep Dhillion is wasted, Dalip Tahil is good, rest are okay. Direction is not at all upto standards. The ending is more of a comic scene than an action. Music is average, Teri Bandmasshiya stands out. Overall, another average clichéd movie from the late 90's which didn't quite work despite the excellent acting.\n",

            "This movie is outstanding, this film is based on the reality of this generation. akshay Kumar, Prithvi, and pankaj are the three sons of anupam kher and they refuse anything what there father says. Even a slight, Anupam kher has a business which he would like to handover to the three sons but the three sons refuse and go dating.In order for them to listen Anupam Kher, Anupam kher threatens them to marry The girls that they fancy, there mother. And speaking about the mother the mother is in the same situation as anupam kher. So both together join up and teach the boys and girls a lesson. However bear this in mind if Anupam kher marries Moushmi Chatterji then the boys and girls relation will turn into brothers and sisters. It is a fun comedy movie with laughters and cries. You'll enjoy this movie.\n",

            "Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Satyakam was a veritable lesson on how to pull the viewer's emotional strings. Dharmendra was gifted his career's finest role (those of you who scoff at \"Garam Dharam\", visit his past with movies like Anupama, Chupke Chupke, Ankhen and innumerable others). He plays Satyapriya, an individual who values lofty ideals of truth above all else; his career, family and life itself. This movie could so easily have degenerated into a soppy melodrama, but Hrishikesh Mukherjee's skills are at the forefront. Satyapriya and his friend Naren (the inimitable Sanjeev Kumar) finish engineering college, and set out on different career paths. Sanjeev Kumar remains honest, but practical, and works hard to become successful. Dharmendra remains in his world of idealism and resolute resistance to compromise, and struggles through every step. Yet, not for a moment does he waver from adherence to truth. In his very first job, he works for a debauch prince (this was set in the pre-independence/ early independence era). The prince desires to \"own\" Sharmila Tagore (the illegitimate daughter of his manager, David). Through chance occurrences, Dharmendra lands in a situation to protect Sharmila, but in a moment of weakness, wavers. The prince rapes Sharmila, and the idealistic Dharmendra then marries Sharmila.How is this different from any other sixties flick, you ask? It is here that Hrishikesh Mukherjee's talent in portraying human nature, and developing characters shines through. Dharmendra, though the supreme idealist, is unable to accept Sharmila or her child completely, and even through his idealism, his completely human nature shines through.Later Naren (Sanjeev Kumar) reappears, and beautifully personifies the every-day man, one of us, who would compromise (but only so slightly) in order to move ahead in one's career. Yet the compromise would be \"practical\", never something that would weigh on one's conscience. The contrast between the two characters is one of the movie highlights. Dharmendra is unable to accept these compromises, and the conflict is beautifully wrought out. Dharmendra eventually dies of cancer, and the film leads to its incredibly moving climax.Ashok Kumar (Dharmendra's father) wants Sharmila Tagore's son to light Dharmendra's pyre. Sharmila (who is not accepted by Ashok Kumar) in a moment of stark honesty, says that the child is not Dharmendra's son, but is illegitimate. Satyapriya's honesty lives on.It is one of those touching climaxes where it is far easier to let tears flow, than hold them back.Satyakam is another Hrishikesh Mukherjee classic. Dharmendra is the main protagonist who gives the performance of his career in this film. We see no shades of the action man we get to see in later blockbusters like Sholay or Dharmveer. Here Dharmendra underplays a soft righteous man treading on the path of truth at every step despite conflict and hardship. Sanjeev Kumar plays the supporting lead extremely well, he had only done 17 odd films before this one.Great performances and worth a watch!\n",

            "Lamhaa (moment) is a one step below follow-up by the maker of Parzaania, Rahul Dholkia who has taken up the issue of Kashmir with a lot of research work on his part. He has chosen a good script and done his casting very intelligently. Lamhaa is thoroughly engrossing and maintains an air of thrill throughout. It is a fast movie which appears to be even faster because of its short length and proportionately very large canvas to cover. Definitely it is not a classic like his previous venture Parzaania but able to leave its mark notwithstanding.The story is nothing but the turmoil in Kashmir by the zehaadis with the help of Pakistan to tackle which a military intelligence officer is sent in the disguise of a disgruntled Kashmiri Mulsim. He searches like-minded Kashmiris to strengthen his hands and helps them on one hand alongwith seeking their help in uncovering the true faces behind the leaders of the anti-government forces on the other.The director has ended the story without offering any solution to the problem or passing any kind of subjective strictures. He has shown his better sense by presenting the status of the things as it is alongwith the mentality of the people of all kinds involved therein. The director's research work and honesty of narration is clearly visible in the movie. It is a movie made with a great effort and toil.The problem with the narrative is that the director has chosen a very big canvas for his script but made a movie lengthy of hardly two hours. That's why he has attempted at several facets of the problem but fell short of time in dealing with each one of them effectively and meaningfully. That's why certain things (viz. the plight of the Kashmiri pundits) have been just touched and certain things have been treated quite superficially. The maker of Parzaania was expected to be more insightful in his approach. There was no need to make an over-crisp movie and some additional length would have given him room to fill proper colours in all the frames of his outline.However Rahul Dholkia's effort cannot be underrated by any angle as he has made a fast-paced, action-packed, adrenaline-pumping movie. If you look at it from an entertainment viewpoint, it is an engrossing thriller without allowing the viewer any time to think (though the subject-matter is thoughtful as well as thought-provoking only). You won't regret after watching it.Casting is very intelligent. Sanjay Dutt has been taken over by age (he is 51 years old now which is clearly visible in his looks). However he is the best choice for the central character tying all the ends of the story together in a single thread. Bipasha Basu has her own fan following in India (perhaps abroad too) and let me frankly tell you the name of one of her die-hard fans - Jitendra Mathur. She is gorgeous, appealing and effective, all at the same time. Among others, Anupam Kher has done well whereas Kunal Kapoor's weakness of character has let him down. Perhaps the director has tried to insert some of his personal views regarding the solution of the problem in the movie through the character of Kunal Kapoor which looks a bit unreal. The complete supporting cast has done exceedingly well.Songs with the background score, locations and art direction, cinematography, editing, production value; everything is Aclass. The cinematographer has done an outstanding job by capturing the eternal beauty as well as the tormented status of Kashmir in the best possible manner.The movie is quite realistic in the major part of it and quite superficial and oversimplified at certain places. Yet, one thing is certain that it is thoroughly gripping, from beginning to end. In fact, the style of story-telling in this movie is similar to that of J.P. Dutta in his trilogy of Border, Refugee and LOC-Kargil.The narrator has shown what the Indian intelligentsia thinks and feels about the Kashmir issue, nothing new. The fact is, the director, despite his sincere research, cannot work like the hero of his story to dig out the all the hidden things. Hence he has portrayed what he himself considers the reality behind the havoc. The secret hidden behind the curtain may be something else. Who knows ? Now-a-days, the use of explete language is increasing in the Hindi movies in the name of showing the reality as our censor board has got extremely liberal with respect to the language.Lamhaa is also no exception. However I completely disapprove of it as it snatches the flair of dignity and decency from the movie. When each and every reality cannot be shown, why can't we abstain from the use of vulgar language.Kashmir has been converted into a company delivering profits to several interest-groups and looting the common Kashmiris, has been reiterated quite often in the movie and it appears to be the reality. The issue of flesh-trade of the Kashmiri girls has been quite humanly demonstrated through the statement of them - Hamen To Har Koi Lootata Hai Chahe Wo Military Ho Ya Zehaadi (we are looted by everybody whether it is the military or the militants). The scene of bashing of Bipasha Basu by the mob is heart-tearing.All in all, a better movie was expected by the maker of a masterpiece like Parzaania. However it is not a disappointing one. I sum up the Kashmir issue in which the biggest sufferer is the innocent, with the words - Ladaai Abhi Zaari Hai (the fight continues).\n",

            "Rajat Kapoor tells us the tale of Raghu, a humble waiter (Vijay Raaz)who's in love with Neetaji (the radiant Maria Goretti), a character from a soap opera. It's ironic that I just rewatched 'Nurse Betty' yesterday and the inspiration shows but the similarities pretty much end there as 'Raghu Romeo' remains its own film. Pritam is behind the music and there are a few ripped-off tracks but it's funny to see how that's presented.Vijay Raaz proves to be one of the funniest actors today. Having witnessed his comic performances in 'Monsoon Wedding', 'Pran Jaaye Par Shaan Na Jaye' and even 'Run' (him being the best thing in that movie). With 'Anwar' and 'Company' he's proving to be quite versatile too. He's the perfect choice for 'Raghu' as his unconventional looks and mannerisms only add to the character's genuineness. Saadiya Siddiqui's Sweety and Maria Goretti's Reshma provide the perfect contrast to Raghu. As Reshma, Goretti is a little hyper but that too proves to be an advantage as it contrasts well with her soap opera character 'Neeta'. It's great to see Siddiqui finally in a full-fledged role of the (unusual) heroine. Saurabh Shukla plays a hit-man who's hilariously in love with Sweety.Shukla's writing is commendable but there are a few plot holes. I've spotted about one or two but this does not bring down the entertainment value of the film and can be overlooked. I like how Rajat Kapoor tells uncommon stories about common people (e.g. 'Mixed Doubles' and 'Mithya') and as a director he does a pleasant job. This is especially evident in the last scene after an upset Raghu, sitting next to his indifferent mother, watches Neeta on television.\n",

            "The exquisite mood captured by this masterpiece is unique in my experience of motion pictures. \"Colonial rule\" in India was not English, but British. The many Irish, Welsh and Scots who lived and died in India would hate to be called English. However, the dedicated husband and wife thespians are eccentrically English, of course. Their daughter, Lizzie, has never been outside India, and knows less of England than Sanju, the man she thinks she loves. The action is not set during the last days of the Raj, as reported in some reviews. Nabokov's \"Lolita\", which is pointedly displayed early in the film (perhaps because it is also about the seduction of one culture by another), was first published in 1955, and Indian Independence took place in 1947. Sanju drives a white Mercedes, which I wouldn't like to date, but which is very definitely post-1955. The film was made in 1965. The rise of Bollywood must have been taking place at about this time. Much of the delicate ambiance of the film is totally lost if the audience is misled into believing that India was like this before Independence. Only the ghost of the Empire lingers on in this quiet story. It is not really about a \"clash\" of cultures, with the violent hostility which that word implies; rather, it gently acknowledges that the old order is changing, giving place to a new. Indian potentates no longer personally strangle unwitting intruders for entering their women's quarters. I hope not, anyway. The lives of Lizzie's parents are irrevocably inter-woven with a vanished time: they will die in India. Because Lizzie has no place in the new India, she has to be sent away to a home she doesn't know. Her Indian playboy friend cannot commit himself to marrying her.Nevertheless, the truth is that in spite of the mockery directed against the theatre of Shakespeare by a more aggressively volatile element, very many actors on the imperial stage conceived a genuine love of India, and its high and ancient civilisation, and this affection could be recognised and reciprocated, and still is, in some parts. The love affair is, even today, not yet wholly extinct, at least at some levels. This is an infinitely more nuanced work than David Lean's rather nasty and one-dimensional interpretation of E.M.Forster's shallow \"Passage to India\". Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the screenplay of Shakespeare Wallah, displays a far finer spirit, greater precision and deeper humanity. Separation at any age is also a loss.\n",

            "Recently saw Saat Uchakkey and loved it! It is in the league of Hera Pheri and Jane Bhi Do Yaro. It's writing is like Guy Ritchie meets Murakami. I am so glad this masterpiece kept the \"A\" certification and didn't let go of the language because the dialogues comes out best the way it is right now in the film. One character(Manoj Bajpayee) approaches another to get him to take the responsibility for a crime. As he can't do it, so he suggests someone else. The third character can't do it either. Soon a half dozen wackiest men are in search of someone to be the hoodwink and take the responsibility of a mock murder. They eventually meet a wannabe lawyer(Vijay Raaz) who sets the stage for an out of this world comedy drama. I had no idea it was going to be a comedy when I first started watching it but soon enough I was laughing out loud. It's a little slow, but WTF many caper films usually build slowly. But it is thoroughly enjoyable with some gags that I've never seen anywhere else in Bollywood films. Hats Off to the entire cast, you just can't say who is better than the other! If you've just recently watched bad films, and are depressed, this movie is the perfect antidote. It shows the lighter side of people who are down on their luck. Saat Uchakkey creates a fascinating world, wonderful characters, fantastic plot, stupendous soundtrack, amazing screenplay, wonderful production design and cinematography and it is funny, funny, funny....outrageously funny\n",

After seeing the rating and reviews, i wasn't really looking forward to watching the movie but i had the movie on one of those 3 in 1 DVD's hence watched it anyway. Well after watching it i was pretty surprised to find it was decent movie, hence this review and a recommendation to others to give the movie a chance. Don't get me wrong by any means, this is not a polished piece of cinema or even of the horror genre but its not as bad as others have made out either. Also i found that watching the movie on my PC alone in my room did the trick in terms of making the movie a little more scary (although that day i was jumping at shadows hence I'm not sure exactly how much credit to give to the movie for that:))Summation:Decent movie(with flaws as others have mentioned), but worth a watch and great acting from the child actor and Sushmita Sen always puts in a very solid performance. Also it nice to see Bollywood become more diverse, rather then sticking to a the love theme constantly, hence movie like this and directors such as RGV and Mani Ratnam are appreciated.7/10\n",

            "An interesting movie indeed boasting of fine actors and a first-time director who is known as one of India's best actors. Though the idea of running four parallel stories adds further to the interest there's just something lacking to make this movie brilliant. Anyway, on the bright side, there are some wonderful performances by Konkona Sen Sharma (this woman is born to act) who shares great chemistry with Jimmy Shergill (not his best though but good enough), Suhasini Mulay (a surprise as she's cast in a totally different role), Irfan Khan (given that the character is pretty half-baked, he did well with what he got except in his last scene), Paresh Rawal (very likable), Ratna Pathak Shah (decent), Shabana Goswami (likeable for a newcomer) and Ankur Khanna (adequate). The rest range from strictly OK to bad e.g. Boman Irani who's very loud (though less annoying than his other films) and Ayesha Takia (doesn't have much scope). Cinematography is wonderful. Music is nicely put in the background without popping up as a song sequence out of nowhere. The movie starts on a very slow pace but it slowly grows on to the viewer. It could use some editing. For a first time director, I would say it's a decent job but from a veteran actor like Naseeruddin Shah, I'd expected better. The dialogues could do with some improvement too (i mean the dialog between the brother and sister about exploitation tool? who are you kidding?). Unlike masterpiece movies, this doesn't stay long in your mind after you've watched it (except for some performances). In fact if the movie is worth watching it's for all the scenes with Konkona, particularly from the moment on where she loses her ticket at the airport lingers in mind. On the whole even though it's a flawed movie, it's quite a decent watch.\n",

In the 80s there were the Ramsay Family, who have produced a few Horror films. Some include Purani mandir, Thakana and Dak Bangla. Veerana is no doubt their best work. After 90s there have been a few more Hit Horror Movies like Bhoot, Raaz, Raat, Vastu Shastra and Darna Mana Hai. In my opinion Veerana is better out of them all. Many people say Raaz was Great, but it was copy of Hollywood Movie what lies beneith. Veerana has its own storyline added with Indian culture. Black Magic and Witches. The witch in this movie looks a bit like a Vampire. For a 80s Bollywood film, this has some great Art added in. The way the monster is picturised is Impressive.

            "Vijay Kumar(Rajnikant) is a young man with a tumultuous past. As a child he saw the massacre of his family and rape of his teenage sister. Vijay has no regard for law as he witnessed how killers got away Scot free. To avenge his family's massacre is Vijay's only aim in life but his own sister Durga is an honest police Inspector and she cannot let him take law in his own hands. Jan Nisar(Bachchan) is middle aged tramp. He finished a jail on charge of a murder. He comes out and finds out that the deceased is actually alive. Vijay and Ja Nisar are victims of the law and so Ja Nisar and Vijay take the law for a ride for Vijay's cause. This movie is super. It looks like a common Indian 80's film but its not. Its a very carefully written piece of art. A satire par excellence. Start to end, the story is about law and its victims.This movie is full of ideas. Durga keeps trapping her brother, Vijay keeps dodging police, Killers uses law for the killings, Ja Nisar is a victim of law, Amrish Puri uses law from a different angle, Dharmendra does a small cameo and uses law in his own way, Vijay takes his revenge and make a mockery of law. I think this film is brilliant. In almost every frame a law is broken or someone is a victim of the shortcomings of the law. What a time it was when people used to make film on such important issues. Whatever progress India has seen I think its because of films like these. In a heated discussion a friend of mine argued that Jan Nisar could not have got away killing Ram Gupta in the court even if he had finished a full term already for the same crime. I argued it was not important if he kills in the court or outside the idea is to show the paradox. Of course I don't like the Dialogbazee after that murder but I love that scene where Ja Nisar kills RamGupta in the court. 'Judiciary' is the most important system out of three systems to run a democracy. Other two being legislative and Executive. This film makes you think how far can we go with these laws if they are so easy to be manipulated. As the song says \"Duniya Kee Imarat Ka Kachcha Ek Sutoon(pillar) Hai. Ye Andha Kanoon Hai\" The other important aspect of the film is that its not only about corruption or villain or heroes but also about shortcomings of law. Gist of the film is the title track \"Andha Kanoon\".It's not a Bachchan film. Its a Rajnikant film. Of course Bachchan is good but this is out and out Rajnikant film. He has out performed everyone. Bachchan has done a terrific job too. As Jan Nisar he is extremely convincing. Whenever I think of this film I think of Rajnikant's red eyes and then Bachchans smiling face singing \"Ye Andha Kanoon Hai\". One of the best political song ever written in the history of music. This is a must watch. Just look at the cast. Bachchan, Pran, Amrish Puri, Madan Puri, Rajnikant, Prem Chopra, Asrani, Danny. You cant ask for more. Only 'Jane Bhee Do Yarron' or 'Sholay' can boast of a better cast. With this casting I can watch even 'Kal Ho Na Ho' or may be 'Fanna'. Songs are OK. Not a Bala fan so music is a little put off for me. 9 on 10.\n",

            "Akshay Kumar is a talented actor but it took him a while to establish himself as an actor. If he didn't get the Khiladi films, Suhaag(1994), Elaan(1994), and a few other hit films to act in, his career would've gone downhill. After the debacle of Saugandh(1991), Akshay got films like Dancer(1992), Mr. Bond(1992), the much hyped up Deedar(1992) but all of these films flopped at the box office.Mr. Bond was his third film and it was actually sort of a C Grade film which was a James Bond Rip Off. The film is about India's greatest detective Mr.Bond who has to solve one of his toughest cases ever, the case is of a fugitive named Red Dragon. This guy is some kind of random Thai looking villain who kidnaps kids. He wants a lot of money and his way of making money is kidnapping innocent children. He needs money because to revive his businesses that were destroyed thanks to Mr. Bond. The rest of the film is how Mr. Bond solves the case and saves the children from the clutches of Red Dragon.Direction by Raj Sippy is crass, he fails to connect the movie properly. Yes the movie has a flow but it is not a proper one, random action scenes is how the movie starts. Some random sensuous songs are what follow and then all the explaining happens. The movie has a poor start but the follow up is somewhat decent. Red Dragon look like a mastermind and his character is well built but his master plans are delayed thanks to some boring romance and stupid comedy in the first bits of the film. The second half is when the movie picks up, the movie's main plot thickens and the action helps build the movie. However, the end is stretched and the final few scenes are prolonged. The main tempo of the film is present in the first half but is poorly edited and scripted in the first half. The film awfully drags in the first half of the film and why the police can't make a move on the Dragon is a stupid thing. They have an overpowered agent like Bond so why can't they have him sneak up on Dragon and free the children. Instead of this, the film drags with forced songs, forced comedy, and forced action that finally get's back on track when the movie shifts to Thailand.Akshay Kumar in his earlier days was OK, his action is good but his voice modulation was bad. He was dubbed in a few scenes but that doesn't make his act completely wasted. He does contribute to some good moments, the intelligent confrontation with Daaga is will handled at the beginning(the only decent part from the first half of the film). His expressions are decent but he tends to overact in parts. Sheeba is a lousy heroine, she looks like a bad cousin of Madhoo. She tries to look good but that's all she tries to do, she doesn't succeed in acting nor looking beautiful. The other Bengali actress just looks good in the songs but knows very little acting. Pankaj Dheer does good as the Red Dragon but overdoes it as Daaga. He tends to badly overact as Daaga and his death scene as Daaga is hilarious. However, as Red Dragon he is awesome.Songs are done to death, most of them try to attempt a James Bond theme with girls all around Mr. Bond. None of the songs are good, they all sound the same. Despite having veteran artists like Amit Kumar present, none of the songs are worth listening.On the whole, Mr.Bond is a below average James Bond rip off film. It tries to be a thriller but ends up being a badly made one, the action is good but the story and the editing is poor. It is clearly lifted off a Bond film or a professional English film but, the film fails to make good use of the inspired story and ends up being a crap film. I would only recommend this film to die hard Akshay Kumar fans, but other's this is not even a decent one time watch. Being an Akshay Kumar fan, I didn't mind watching it but this is one of Akshay's weaker films.\n",

A very urban story, plot is simple and perfectly presented. Actors did a great job specially Geetanjali who knitted the story with her innocence and honesty. Ending was very warming which leaves you with a broad smile and delicate warm kolkata air in cool valley of Shimla.\n",

            "In the mid 90s, Akshay was doing great despite have many flops. In 1994, he had 5 hits and 7 flops but the 5 hits were big ones so the flops didn't damage his career. Akshay Kumar and double role didn't quite bond well because most of his films involving double roles haven't worked. Yes, Jai Kishan(1994) was a flop at the box office but it was decent and the typical concept was somewhat entertaining. This was also the first film where Akshay did martial arts with a sword which is a new concept for Bollywood action.Jai Kishan tells the typical story of two brothers who were separated at birth because of a tragic event. Their father got killed by 3 escaped convicts, Jai lost his eyesight while Kishan disappeared. Jai grows up to be a honest man, he has mastered self defense so his blindness doesn't make him a weak person. Meanwhile, Kishan is a career thief. Kishan double crosses these dons and because he accidentally kills the brother of a big don(the same villain who killed his father), he is on their hit list. They want him dead and when they know that Kishan has a brother and a mother, they are also put into this trouble. When Jai learns his father's death, he decides to kill the villains who ruined his childhood. The rest of the film is how Kishan poses as Jai to fool the law while Jai murders the villains and this is followed by an action packed climax.Direction by Sunil Agnihotri is okay, his handling is decent though. The film never drags because of forced comedy, the main focus is the action and this is one really good thing. It is a delight to watch Akshay perform martial arts. Despite some typical romance, the film still works because of the typically well handled plot of revenge. The second half is even better with more important dialogs and action sequences. The only problem is the fact that Kishan doesn't do much but pretend to be Jai, Jai is the one fighting and he has to do everything. I was expecting both the brothers to fight together but that just didn't happen till the climax. The climax is prolonged but Jai wielding a sword to kill the villain is super cool to watch.Akshay Kumar performs well in both roles and despite some overacting, he does a brilliant job. As Jai, Akshay attempts something new with action and his dialog delivery is fabulous. Akshay's expressions while fighting are fantastic while his expressions while romancing Ayesha Jhulka is decent. As Kishan, Akshay repeats his typical act of a reformed thief. Kishan should've gotten more action scenes but fans like me weren't disappointed because Akshay as Jai was just fantastic. If Akshay just had Kishan and Jai was played by some other hero, the film would've been disappointing. Ayesha Jhulka is good but she is completely sidelined in the second half of the film. The other heroine is ordinary and has done what is required. Tinnu Anand has done a decent job as the villain but he tends to overact when he is angry, Deepak Shirke is OK. The rest provide decent support.Music is OK, the only good song is the one which is repeated twice. In the beginning, the song is played and you can see Jai practicing martial arts near the beach which is a delight to watch. When it is played again, it is before the murder of Shirke. The song is called Jhule Lal Dam Mast Kalandar and it is a pretty good song. The rest of the songs are OK .On the whole, Jai Kishan is a decent entertainer which works mainly because of Akshay Kumar's action and the well handled typical story. For Akshay Kumar fans(like me), this is a must watch because the action is just amazing.\n",

            "When I first heard the title I presumed either to be a sleazy movie or yet another new-age cinema on its way to gather dust. Add \"no publicity\" to it and the perceptions sinks deeper than titanic. When I saw Anupam Kher & Kay Kay in credits, I decided to give it a go. And guess what - its a piece of jewel indeed.۝ Kay Kay:: Attempts comedy and does it quite well. The role is well sketched and his passion for fish is well portrayed. At the risk of being repetitive \"Wake up Bollywood - this guy is grossly under- utilised\".۝ Rimmi:: The character seems inspired from Kill Bill & predominantly Entrapment. She gets very good street-smart lines and uses Bengali quite effectively (Dhoom again?). ۝ Anupam Kher:: Spot on. And his role/ accent is a direct lift of his previous outing as Inspector Giridhar in \"Hum\". ۝ Dilip Phabhavalkar:: IMO - though he was good he could have been better especially when it came to amnesia.۝ Chunky:: Good to see him in a suitable role(s) after a very long time. Both the characters though diverse as chalk-and-cheese he managed to give it a distinct flavour. Pity the role was short though.۝ Manoj Pahwa & Sanjay Mishra:: As usual the Laurel & Hardy duo are dependable with good comic timing between them.۝ Virendra Saxena, Yashpal Sharma & Vallabh Vyas:: Very short role but do their job quite well.Barring a few sequences pertaining to the slip-between-the-cup-and-the- lip in the chase of the moolah, the rest is indeed very-very hatke. Quite safe to say director knows his job well. Sankar City, the title might be deceptive but take my word - its original, its entertaining and the size is just about right. Go for it.\n",

            "When the casting shows \"Rahul Rawail\" as director, you do expect something good from the guy who gave winners like \"Arjun\" or \"Dacait\". However, after \"Dacait\", Rahul Rawail has lost his touch, which was quite apparent in \"Anjaam\". And with KKKM, it feels it is the time either he takes a course in direction or call it quits.The opening moments of the movie are quite well handed, with the confrontation between Rishi Kapoor and Rati Agnihotri provided as synopsis rather than typical \"Rona Dhona\" scene. However, as the movie comes into \"present time\", it degenerates. The opening scenes between Kajol and Sunil Shetty, when they meet in London, are not done properly. As a result, the viewer has no clue as to what is going on.The worst thing about the movie is the useless comedy that has been \"shoved in\" to provide comic relief. Instead of providing comical relief in the first half of the movie, the director has chosen to provide comic relief in each and every scene. As a result, one is confused whether the movie is a comedy or an emotional drama. Also, the songs keep coming at regular intervals without any need or situation. Not to mention a very mediocre score by Anu Malik and equally bad lyrics by Sameer.As usual, like a typical Hindi movie, KKKM is not without goofs. One cannot imagine that Rati Agnihotri can own a huge departmental store and still thieves can get away without getting caught in the modern day world of video surveillance cameras and security guards. Or is the police of England so ineffective that it cannot provide security to such huge departmental stores. Also, it is ridiculous to see Kajol driving a battle tank right into the parking lot. I wonder when will Indian directors rise from mediocrity and foreign-locations hangups.Performance wise, everybody does their parts without any dedication as none of the characters have been given enough justice to develop in movie due to inevitable comedy situation. Only saving grace is Rati Agnihotri, who like Sharmila seems very fresh unaffected by age. Hope we can see her in better roles in future.In a nutshell, better opt for a pure comedy movie or a family drama instead of watching such uncooked \"Khichadi\". Yuck\n",

In fact, he goes across the globe to the US, and does things 'his way' there!The plot contains too many loopholes to worry about it, and the humour - though funny at times - is not well executed.To be fair, if you like irrational action, then this movie is for you. There's loads of beating people up, god-like heroism, and a little excess of patriotism & religious fervor.I'd suggest going out for a nice dinner date, rather than spending on this flick -- unless you know you have the appetite for it!\n",

It's amazing how actors like Govinda & Jonny Lever can make a movie so much entertaining when it has nothing in it.Pluses: Govinda - He seems effortless. Johny Lever - Hilarious impersonation of Daler Mehndi. Tapori Dance - Timing with Simran and Tandon is amazing. Tapori Songs - Enjoyable tukbandi.Minuses: Bad Story. Bad Acting - except Govinda. Average directionHere he tries to whip up the usual concoction of gag bag humour in a double role as Rahul, the rich tycoon and Raja, a poor waiter. Rahul lives in a big mansion with his stepmother, Aruna Irani, and uncle, Prem Chopra, who is eyeing his property and is always scheming to grab it.Raja always dream of becoming rich. He gangs up with his girl friend, Sapna (Raveena Tandon) and friend, Sattaar (Satish Shah) and kidnaps the rich one. But his conscience gives him trouble so he let him go, which lets a strange villain, Tiger Tadipaad who tries desperately to look menacing, enter the scene. He abducts the rich guy and then tries to create plastic terror.But, as Shakespeare says, all is well that ends well. Raja makes use of his resemblance with Rahul and after usual antics, succeeds in freeing him from the villain's clutches. Aruna Irani gets her son back, Sona (Simran) gets her fiancée back and there is sudden change of heart in the scheming uncle.

            "Isi Ka Naam Zindagi can now be called a vintage Aamir Khan starrer. When the movie was first released, I remember, there weren't too many takers. The song 'Babam babam bam bhole', composed by Bappi Lahiri, was a moderate hit, and so was the title track sung by Anup Jalota. But the movie is indeed watchable because of the wry social comment that has been packaged intelligently as an over-the-top comedy. It is based on an acclaimed Bengali play by Manoj Mitra, which was first filmed in Bengali by Tapan Sinha as 'Banchharamer Bagan' (considered by many as a cult Bengali classic). Though the compulsions of mainstream Hindi cinema redeems the delicate flavor of the original work to some extent, yet Isi Ka Naam Zindagi deserves to be seen as a delectable comedy with a heart, and also for the fine performances of Aamir Khan, Farha Naaz and Pran.\n",

However, the director makes few effective maneuvers to turn it back on the track. Such movies are really important to impart a psychology in the minds of our young children that how important are teachers in their life and the whole society. Despite of bitter circumstances, hardships and difficulties, they (teachers) are determined to deliver their best selflessly and this makes them to deserve respect from all.

Loved Minnisha Lamba's role too. Sanjay Dutt's extended guest appearance was not as I had anticipated, but pretty good none the less. And I particularly liked Gulshan Grover's role as the Interpol cop. Anusha Dandekar was completely useless in the movie. Raghuveer Yadav was also nice. I loved the whole setting of the movie. The Thai essence was very well captured in the movie. The locations were awesome. The whole feel of the movie was really nice. Some of the songs were shot in really nice places particularly the one \"Tune Mera Chain Vain Le Liya\". Himesh's music was more or less like his other movies. But I liked \"Saawariya\" the best. The humor in the movie was pretty good. I loved the two Hit-Men who tried to kill Arshad. The chemistry between Arshad and Sanjay was a little cold, but is worth a watch. I love Minnisha Lamba in the mo via. She really looks very pretty. Bottom Line: It is a movie with a very different plot and idea than the other Bollywood movies. Definitely a movie worth watching. If not for Sanjay Dutt, watch it for Arshad, he really rocks!!!\n",

The film has been entirely designed to \"launch\" the next gen Deol who neither has looks, charm, talent, or acting prowess. His entire look is somehow dated and cheesy. His dialogue delivery is embarrassing. You wonder how his father directed him and either did not realized or hoped no one works notice. The female lead is actually a little better but has limited scope.The music is weak, the title track is decent though. The locales are beautiful and possibly the only redeeming quality of the film.

            "Dilip Kumar is often referred to as Tragedy-King.However, he has displayed histronics in every type of role.In Mashaal as ANGRY OLD MAN he lights up the screen and makes the excellent movie a classic.The story involves Vinod Kumar(Dilip Kumar) who is a fearless journalist trying to clean the city of Bombay from crime.He resides in a chawl with his wife(Waheeda Rahman). There is a gang of goons who live by the street and proclaim it proudly in the song ''FOOTPATHON KE HUM...''(A sentiment echoed 10 years later in ''Yaaron Sun Lo Zara...'' from RANGEELA).The gang is headed by Raja(Anil Kapoor) who is a wayard guy and the rest of the gang comprises of Gulshan Grover and Madan Jain.Enter the bad men the Puri brothers with Vardhan(Amrish Puri) the chief and Tolaram(Madan Puri, Amrish's real life elder brother)as his assistant.What follows is a fight of good v/s evil but the story takes many interesting twists and aided by some great script and remarkable performances make it a worth watching movie.Yash Chopra is known mainly for his Switzerland based love stories but he did made some hard-hitting cinema like the trilogy of DEEWAR,KAALA PATTHAR and TRISHUL with Amitabh, Shashi Kapoor and SALIM-JAVED.In Mashaal Yash shows his class in handling such a intense movie.The direction is absolutely amazing.The backbone of the movie is a superb story,gripping screenplay and excellent dailogues by Javed Akhtar,who by now had split with Salim.The movie shows his ability to create ANGRY OLD MAN alongwith his trademark ANGRY YOUNG MAN.The dailogues whenever Dilip Kumar and Anil kapoor come face to face are brilliant.Mashaal remains one of the best movies written by Javed Akhtar after he broke away from Salim.Another high point of the movie is its excellent music.Hridyanath Mangeshkar has never been a big music composer but in Mashaal he gives a superb sound track.All the songs ''Footpathon ke hum...'',''Holi aayee..'' and ''Mujhe tum yaad..'' are very pleasant on the ears.The tunes are aided by some fabulous lyrics by Javed Akhtar who proves his ability as a lyricist also.However,the icing on the cake is the song ''Leeye sapne nigaahon mein...'' which opens infront of Bangalore's Vidhan Sabha.The song is excellently sung by Kishore Kumar and aided by some fantastic lyrics and melodious music make it one of the best songs ever picturised on Anil Kapoor.The echoes of the feeling conveyed in the song can be heard in ''Chaand Taare..'' from Yes Boss which incidentally was penned by Javed again. The film breaks many new grounds like working of press, the threat to fearless journalists from underworld,the life in slums,the lives of a gang of goons who are not that brute,changing of sides after the interval between the 2 male protagnists(there is even a mention of football match).The sets showing the slums are very real.The topic of a gang of goons wandering aimlessly came later in movies like Arjun(again written by Javed Akhtar) and Ankush.The slum life again came on the screen in underworld sagas like Angaar and Vaastav.It was much later that films on press like New Delhi,Surkhiyaan and Main Azaad Hoon came into light.Although the concept of male protagnists first appeared in Roti,Kapda aur Makaan, it was with Mashaal that it got famous and an entire movie called Lakshman Rekha was beased on the concept.The film does not have many light sequnces and people expecting over the top comedy will be disappointed.The character of Dimple Kapadia in Krantiveer where she portrays a journalist who wants to reform the society and stays in slums has strong shades of Dilip Kumar's role in the first half of this movie.Infact a few years ago a film called Laawaris(the one with Jackie and Akhsaye Khanna) was made which was a poor copy of Mashaal.Anil Kapoor as Raja delivers one of his best performances till date.In a role which initially was supposed to be written for Amitabh bachchan(evident from the language he uses)and first offered to Kamal Hasan,Anil shines throghout the movie.His honesty in his performance is so much present that u miss such honesty in his later films.Although,Anil later admitted of developing cold feet on the thought of acting opposite Dilip Kumar,he stands on his own very well in everyframe.It is said that a Feroze Khan and Subhash Ghai signed Anil for Jaanbaaz and Meri Jung respectively just after watching the movie's premiere. Infact Anil Kapoor somehow got trapped in a tapori image for a long-long time after Mashaal.His characters in Andar Bahar,Tezaab,Ram Lakhan to the recentnt dud-Rishtey all have shades of Raja of Mashaal.Anil Kapoor again worked with Dilip Kumar in the blockbuster KARMA.His other refined performance in a Javed Akhtar scripts are Meri Jung and the recent Armaan.Anil kapoor won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor In A Supporting Role for Mashaal. Somehow I miss the Yash Chopra,Anil Kapoor and intensity of Javed Akhtar, the way they were in Mashaal.Waheeda Rahman as Dilip Kumar's wife gives a superb performance.It was after 16 years that she acted opposite the thespian the last being Aadmi(1968).Rati Aghinotri as Anil's love interest also gives a decent performance.Amrish Puri as the bad guy delievers another good performance. Incidentally,Amrish acted opposite Dilip Kumar in almost all his later movies where he played the Angry Old Man and puri the baddie.Vidhaata,Duniya,Shakti and Saudagar are other movies where both of them clash.The performances by Madan Puri,Gulshan Grover and Madan Jain are well enacted.Yash Chopra uses some great stage actors -Saaed Jaffery,Nilu Phule, Alok Nath and Mohan Agashe in this movie and extract some fine performances from them. Although when released in 1984 the film flopped but it was slowly and steadily that it became famous and acclaimed.Now thanks to several re-runs it enjoys a classic status.Last but not the least,Dilip Kumar delivers a knockout performance.From a fearless journalist to a man running a crime syndicate the legend shows amazing verstality in his performance.His eye expression,dailogue delivery and usage of hands makes this performance of his one of his best ever.Whenever we see any actor mimicking Dilip Kumar,most of the times they enact the sequence from this movie where he tries to stop car on the street hoping that someone might help his dying wife.That speaks volumes of the impact he made in that scene.A similar scene apperaed in Ghayal and later in the dud-Yaadein.Yash Chopra is said to have shot the entire scene in 4 nights on Bombay streets and according to him the thespian maintained the same emotional graph throghout all 4 days. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING DEDICATION!!\n",

            "A friend of mine had watched Listen Amaya when it was screened as a part of the London Asian Film Festival and had raved about it. I hadn't even heard of the film, but when she spoke of it, looking it up on Google and IMDb, I realised that it had come and gone.I've watched the film on DVD yesterday and I have to say, the praise is justified!I am a middle aged divorcée. While Listen Amaya speaks of two widowed people wanting to start a relationship, I see so many subtle themes that are at play here, that I can so easily relate to what happens on screen.Children have no right over their parents or their lives, and for the vast majority of Indians, it is almost impossible to comprehend that fact. Our responsibility towards our children is to bring them up, care for and nurture them to become free thinking individuals, in their own lives. I as a parent though, still reserve the right to live mine the way I see fit. If I choose to take a partner, whether in marriage or in civil partnership, it is my fundamental right to do so.I enjoyed the way Leela and Jayant's love story unfolded with such grace and simplicity. I thoroughly enjoyed the liberal use of intelligent humour and I admit that I also choked at some of the more emotional moments. Rarely have I seen a film which touches on sensitive issues and still stays away from sermonizing about what is right or wrong. That doesn't mean the film has no flaws. It could easily have been a little shorter in the first half of the film. It definitely did not need any songs, although two of them are situational and therefore may be discounted. While the language used is primarily Hindi, there is too much English for it to be accepted as a mainstream film and therein lies it's biggest problem. A film like this deserves to be seen by a very wide audience, because so many people will connect with it, but it does itself no favors by targeting a small section of that audience by the limited marketing it seems to have done.If I don't agree with the way Leela and Jayant dealt with Amaya's abject pigheadedness, I also understand that it is a deeply personal reaction and that everyone's will be different. So while I won't judge the characters, I will judge what the film did for me. Listen Amaya made me take notice of smaller, independent films that are being made today, which rely on story telling rather than a marketing blitz to sell tickets, or DVD's! It also renewed my faith in the fact that cinema can still entertain, without resorting to cheap gimmickry or sleaze.See it if you can, because it's two hours that will stay with you for a lot longer than the time you took to watch it.\n",

Saif Ali Khan was at this point yet to come into his own, but Kajol was more than good as she almost always is.

Oh and she has also given her and Anil's child to Raveena.3.Anil FLIRTS/has physical relations with both the women at the same time.4.Raveena suspects something going on between Anil and Rambha but isn't sure. She talks badly to Rambha but the others (Anil and his father) scold Raveena for that! Because a wife should be absolutely okay with her husband flirting/hugging/kissing with another woman.5.At the end, Raveena finds out the truth that Rambha is Anil's wife and the son is theirs (Anil and Rambha's). She shouts at them. The father- in-law then tells her that SHE is the one who can't conceive not Anil. This makes her REALIZE... I don't know what. At the end both the women live happily with Anil.So this movie basically states that if a woman is infertile then her husband can marry another woman and she shouldn't complain. Since Raveena is infertile so she has no right to complain/feel bad when her husband remarries. Raveena is expected to treat the other woman as a sister (which she does by the way, at the end).This is beyond pathetic. I am not a prude or something but I don't find the above things remotely funny. And I am pretty sure marrying another person while you are already married is a punishable offense (at least in this particular country where the crappy movie takes place).\n",

            "Akshay Kumar is a decent actor and no I will not deny this even if he has acted in some of the worst Bollywood films ever. It was the 1997-1999 period that was his worst where his films came and all of them proved to be nothing but back to back failures. The worst part is that some of these films were not even worth watching, I can't believe Akki signed such movies without even thinking how crap the movie could turn out to be.Taarazu is another crap film from 1997 where Akki plays either a cop, a reformed thug, or a good for nothing in the disaster Lahoo Ke Do Rang. Taarazu has him playing a cop and honestly, Akki does good as the cop though he has done it so much now. His best cop acts were from Aan: Men at Work, Mohra, Sabse Bada Khiladi, Main Khiladi Tu Anari, Sapoot, Rowdy Rathore, Khakee, and even the most recent Khiladi 786. However, Taarazu falls into one of his worst cop actors ever. In Daava too, he just hams and completely hams. However, in that film the story is better executed and Akki does better sort of. However, this film is crass from every single aspect. The story is not worthy of even being labeled as an average. The typical story as I mentioned in many of my reviews I don't mind it. However, the problem is that if the handling, the performances, the songs, everything is not up to mark, the movie is considered a piece of crap. In this case, Taarazu fits along with this statement.The movie has no absolute story, it is about an honest cop Ram Yadav who lives with his brother and sister in law. They as well as their son gets killed by the villain Appa Rao and his gang of villains which include his son Jannardan. The reason why Appa Rao does this is because he is sick of Ram always intruding in their illegal business. In a typical police story this is what always happens. The police officer harms the villains and their illegal activities. Lots of family drama, comedy happens in the first half, the second half is when the hero's family is killed and he is jailed or left for dead. He then seeks revenge and kills all the villains and in this process he may loose his life. However, these typical movies are good when their handling is good. Taarazu fails to even do this properly. If the handling was decent, the film would be better.Direction by Vimal Kumar is crass, he gives his worst film ever. This is probably one of his few directional ventures and it is proved that not all assistant directors can give good directional ventures.Performances are okay. Akshay Kumar as Ram Yadav does his typical overacting comedy in the first half and some solid dialogs. After which he is harmed, and then he takes his revenge in style. However, the movie is so crass that this style gets quite boring as the editing and logic even in the culmination and post interval portions is completely missing. Sonali Bendre in her only film where she is paired with Akshay does OK. She is again mainly used as a romantic and comic prop. She does a fair job. Amrish Puri as Appa Rao gives one of his worst villainy acts ever, he overacts quite a lot. Monish Behl as the villain's son Jannardhan gives a crass performance. On the whole, the performances disappoint.IMDb doesn't allow the vote of giving no stars but this film even if that option was enables deserves a start for having a few good action scenes.However, for the most part, Taarazu is a must avoid garbage flick with lots of horrendous overacting and a stupid good for nothing lousy story. Akshay Kumar you are the only reason I saw this film and I must say, if I wasn't a good fan of yours, I would have never seen such a lousy garbage film.\n",

            "Kishan Kanhaiyah is a Bollywood Masala Movie. It contains the usual Romance, Comedy, Action and Family Drama. I think this is Anil Kapoor's Finest Work. Anil Kapoor has made many great films such as Parinda, Hifazat, Ram Lakhan, Khel and Tezaab. The female leads were Madhuri Dixit who is no doubt one of Blooywood Best Actresses of the late 80s and 90s. She delivers a comic performance that entertains. The other female lead was the very sexy Shilpa Shirodkar in a more serious role. She does a good job of it. Kishan Kanhaiyah tells the story of two twin brothers, separated at birth. If one gets hurt, the other feels the pain. The movie does have many exciting scenes. It was directed by Rakesh Roshan. The Man behind Great Movies like Khudgarz, Khel, Karan Arjun, Koyla and Koi Mil gaya. This is Rakesh Roshan's simply Best film he has made. Absolute Delight, Highly recommended.\n",

            "On 4/8/1999, I was having all the hopes in the world. The commercial title of it in Egypt stood for (The Explosion). The broad poster of it looked splendid while being hanging over the video store's door. However, the idea of old, returning, Bachchan apart was more interesting. And after (Mrityudaata), (Bade Miyan Chote Miyan), and (Sooryavansham) I said to myself: \"Hey, the man sure had enough, and here's the time to one of the old times fares\". So I rented the movie, and the only explosion I had was the explosion of my rage!As for the songs, save \"Baba Nanak Dukhiyan\", the song at the place of worship, and \"Hum Hain Banaras Ke Bhaiya\", the song of the wedding, all the rest is forgettable, not to mention so forced; like the song at the nightclub with characters that we won't see later!As for the action, save the intro assassination sequence; which's a masterpiece, and too good to be in this movie--there is nothing special. Or rather there is nothing!As for the comedy, save couple of moments for Bachchan as Dada, it's worthless. Let alone that Nana Patekar's disguise as feeble-minded journalist seemed unbearable sometimes!Speaking about comedy, when it comes to make laughs, nothing can ever compete with this plot. It's utterly ridiculous, with holes that can hold the entire Indian nation!Simply How the fugitive Col. Balbir Singh Sodi became Dada Bhai or this village's good old chieftain in no time?! How the government just forgave him so easily at the end, bringing him back to his rank and his job, while he's a murderer?? It's as if by the time of shooting the end, they forgot wholly what the start was! And How goofy the ending scene sounded with perfectly fabricated satirical message! These \"Hows\" are many and provoking, however the biggest one of them all is How Bachchan worked with director Mehul Kumar after the historical flop of (Mrityudaata) 2 years earlier???For the money?, being there?, the courtesy? Whatever the reason was; this is one clear idiot movie. We weren't used to see the big B in small-time movies like this, so how about suffering this condition for a whole decade already; from the late 1980s to the late 1990s! I was shocked that he did such an embarrassment to himself, and in this very critical phase of his career as well. But not to worry, because (Mohabbatein) is one year ahead, and - while being not a great movie itself - it would be Bachchan's long-lost hit, to be saved by the bell!..Now I notice that the arrival of (Kohram) to Egypt's video stores in the same year of its production was a bad omen that I didn't see at the moment. They wanted to make money, any money, by it from the poor middle-eastern fans of Bachchan. But a fan of him or not, (Kohram) is an insult to you more than an entertainment.It said in its end that some politicians do wrong and get away with it, well.. and some movie-makers too!\n",

            "Director approach towards film is completely confusing. Sometimes he tries to make it love story then takes turn to political drama then revenge and eventually landed in a mess. Story has nothing new. It is typical like old movie. Screenplay is jerky. They tried to stuff comedy in emotional scenes. A mother slaps her daughter for her rebelling nature but massages her feet in night, while she is sleeping. This scene has an emotional note but suddenly daughter awakes and in lieu of adoring her mother's care, she starts laughing. Was she mad or mentally challenged to understand such type of basic human emotions? Characterization is bad. Few scenes are so old fashioned. A boy died and his father melodramatically calls him to respond. The days are gone of such scenes. A romantic intense scene is going on and suddenly some girls appear from nowhere and start giggling, this way they just crush the romance. In a scene, girl is shown with a water bottle but in next voice over about her informs that she has been roaming hungry and thirsty. They deliberately ignored such type of mistakes or even they were unable to figure it out? Second half of film is very boring and climax is unbearable. Performance wise Kartik Tiwari as Binda is OK. Lead girl Mishti as Kaanchi looks good as well as act but she literally shrieks in intense scenes. Mithun Da had given plump face look, which does not suit him at all and it was not required even. Rishi Kapoor is fine. Chandan Roy Sanyal as Inspector Bagula is fantastic. His acting is an only relief in this film. Music is OK. Track of fast song are good but lyrics does not support it well.\n",

            "Okay, very simple - after years of marriage, a man finds out his wife cheated on him and that the boy he raised and considered his son is not his biological child. The film addresses gender inequality with stress on the unbearable double standard with which the sins of men and women are treated by the hypocrite male-dominated society. In this regard, this film's standpoint is quite refreshing, but then, not enough. Firstly, the film makes great efforts to emphasise how wrong it was on the wife's part specifically because she is a woman. And then a big leap is taken to almost legitimize adultery. One must remember, the husband's regressive views notwithstanding, the wife's actions are purely unacceptable. That she has made a mistake in a moment of weakness and decided to hide it is understandable, but that she had a son from this extramarital affair and kept it a secret for decades from her unsuspecting husband - much less so. But then the balance is there and it's well thought out.I thoroughly enjoyed Mahesh Manjrekar's Astitva. There is conflict here, a great moral one, and the viewers must have conflicting views when confronted by the story and its well-formed foundation. I liked the fact that the film didn't turn the husband into a complete antagonist in order to convey its feminist message. There are some glitches here and there, mostly technical, in terms of dubbing and sound, but the film works. It is simple and realistic and works as both a human story and a psychological, suspenseful drama. Astitva greatly benefits from Tabu's presence and her extraordinarily brave performance for that time. She is highly nuanced and believable, and her monologue by the end of the film is brilliant, in terms of both writing and dialogue and especially in view of her acting and conviction in it. Sachin Khedekar is effective, and so is Mohnish Bahl. It is the appearance of Namrata Shirodkar which is a bit of a stretch, but the film is still concluded well, and kudos to Tabu anyway.\n",

Her luck changes when she meets Captain Aditya who promises to help her escape from the clutches of evil. Too bad the pairing of Chopra and Rampal was particularly very bad here.

            "This is the type of film whose audience know what to expect. And by that sense, Dirty Politics honestly attracts you into a political crime drama that is riddled with sleaze.The disappearance of dancer-turned-politician Anokhi Devi (Mallika Sherawat) is what the story begins with. Having dragged into politics by a debaucher Dinanath (Om Puri) solely for sexual purposes, Anokhi finds herself trapped in a world of deceit. The blame is partly on her as she turns into a greedy provider for her benefactor's erotic fantasies. The entire film is the past and future of her disappearance, infrequently throwing light into practices that mar present-day politics.Characters are thrown in like rain accompanied by sandstorm; all at once, giving an abrupt start. Soon cleavages are revealed and sex tapes are made, which drive the story ahead. Honestly, the sensual chemistry between Puri and Sherawat is awkward, and no viewer in his/her right mind would enjoy the explicitness. The story, as a whole, reeks of predictability and wraps up with a rather laughable climax. At the end, of whatever was promised by the film, only sex prevails, as Bokadia may have wanted. It has all basic characters and elements required for a Prakash Jha movie, but only Bokadia can turn it into a circus of lewdness.It is clear that salaciousness was what the makers had in mind, but to cast veterans like Shah and Kher to play clowns is cheap. They are the only ones who make the viewing bearable if at all you happen to find yourself watching the film. Let me stop myself from exploring the filmmaking factors.BOTTOM LINE: Of course, there is no actual sex (only suggestive) in the film if you were wondering, but it sure has obscene scenes and curses that will make the CBFC's blood boil. I'll leave the decision to you. You watched the trailer, and I gave you the details. What more do you want for decoding that the \"Dirty\" in \"Dirty Politics\" is an implication to that three-letter word which is still a taboo in India.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "K.C Bokadia's Lal Baadshah was my favorite Amitabh Bachchan film when I was a kid. However, it was nothing short of a distasteful disaster as saw the film again as an adult. Amitabh was facing a massive debt during the late 1990s so he signed some films without showing any concern for the script. This explains why he did awful craps like Mrityudaata(1997) and Lal Baadshah(1999). Unfortunately, even this typical flick couldn't succeed as even the masses lost interest after a period of time.Lal Baadshah's biggest snag is the fact that the screenplay is poorly written with ample scope for illogical scenes. For instance, Amrish Puri has purchased some munitions and is transported them to Bombay. Amitabh somehow gets this news and destroys the truck. Another major nonsensical sequence is the atrocious climax. Lal Singh is tied up and shot but he sings a song to stop his father from accepting defeat. He is given time to sing a forced song and this makes the film even more vacuous. Another illogical aspect is the fact that Manisha Koirala's character disappears from the film too early and is conveniently dragged into the film for the climax. In addition, Amitabh's pairing with Manisha Koirala was corny and the chemistry was completely missing. Some additional jarring issues were the illogical action scenes. For instance, some hooligans randomly disappear and Amitabh jumping from the ground floor of a building to it's roof is just utterly preposterous. In short, the action is jaded and despicable.K.C Bokadia may have been a successful producer but he is an exasperating director. The man has helmed hogwash like Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) which surprisingly was a hit during Amitabh's dull phase. His Lal Baadshah makes Aaj Ka Arjun look like a masterpiece. Bokadia has not handled the film properly because this entire garbage feels completely disjointed. After a tolerable star, the entire film is composed of poorly editing scenes which are randomly forced together. Sometimes, the transitioning is completely disastrous. I understand that you cannot expect logic from many 1990s films but Lal Baadshah has some aforementioned content which is just impossible to digest. Basically, K.C Bokadia and his team have tried to make a typical masala film but even if you go by the 1990s yardstick, you know that this is unacceptable.The film has typical unsound music with only Dhanno Ki Ankh being a saving grace. Every other song including I like your eyes baby (Koi Hai Dil Dene Wala) is just disappointing. Some of the songs are not even used in the film. The worst song has to be Tala Kholan Chabhi Se which states the obvious. In other words, this is one of the late Aadesh Srivastava's weakest compositions.Amitabh Bachchan faces an uphill task and he tries his best to revive this garbage. However, this really is a Herculean task because the script is a complete letdown. The film is crippled but if anyone makes this nightmare bearable, it is Amitabh Bachchan. He is amazing with the Bihari accent and his comic timing is brilliant. Amitabh has portrayed such roles countless times so it isn't exactly a challenge for him. The heroines, Manisha Koirala and Shilpa Shetty, are good in their parts but they don't have much of a scope to show their acting abilities. Amrish Puri was typecast as the villain and Mukesh Rishi was once again playing the same supporting villain successfully. Raghuvaran with a poorly dubbed voice was nothing great, he cuts a sorry picture. In fact, his dubbing is completely off in some scenes. The south actress, Radhika Sarathkumar, played Bachchan's sister in Aaj Ka Arjun. In this imbroglio, she plays Bachchan's mother which is again another example of horrendously poor casting. She performs decently but she was better in Aaj Ka Arjun. Shakti Kapoor has a small role and he provides some decent laughs. Jack Gaud tries to appear menacing but he is killed early in the film so he couldn't create much of an impact. The rest of the cast provide decent support.On the whole, Lal Baadshah is a despicably absurd show all the way. This is one film only die hard Amitabh Bachchan fans wouldn't mind watching. This disaster's only saving grace is one aforementioned song and Amitabh Bachchan's entertaining performance as a Bihari hero.\n",

This is a good example for film school students on how a movie could still fail in spite of having pretensions to the contrary.The plot doesn't make any concessions to its setting and does not make any attempts to connect it to its Indian setting. Character development needs much to be desired and it drags on. Overall, the movie gives as much pleasure as a coitus interruptus. It doesn't quite start right, picks up a little steam in the middle and fizzles because the director doesn't know how to end it.Nair tries to capture the obsession and disappointment of the boy from the original film but loses it by trying to dilute it to placate the Indian viewer.

            "I would say the strength of the movie lies in the complexity of its characters, situations, and emotions. It has an Omkara feel to it with Bobby trying to destroy Upen's life as Saif tried to do to Ajay Devgan. What I found most interesting is how seemingly innocent, loving, passionate people such as Bobby's character can be consumed by so much hatred and envy and how Upen shuts out all people who care about him and only trusts the one man who is out to ruin him. A very powerful story indeed--however, quite a bit of tackiness combined with an ending that pretty much ruined the movie even if you were enjoying it was quite disheartening. Anupam Kher's portion was nice and could have been explored further. Kangana was good as usual. Celina was bad as usual. Bobby was good. You hate Upen when he's being selfish, but you feel sorry for him later on--as much as I hate to admit, I guess those are signs of a good actor. Music is slightly catchy, but a movie like this that centers around music deserves more than just a (barely) foot-tapping score. Now, you can't expect a Taal out of every film's soundtrack, but something that highlights the emotions and thoughts going on in the minds of the characters was necessary.\n",

            "Hum Hain Bemisaal is one of the many action films which was completely unnoticed in the 1990s. This action film would have been a complete trainwreck had it not been for some of the performances. If the film has any other noteworthy element, it is emotional core of the story which definitely has its moments.Deepak Bahry's direction is far from memorable because he has not handled the film effectively. The main problem is the jarring comedy which is completely unnecessary. The main plot would've been much stronger if it was the main focus. Bahry inserts puerile comedy which reduces the film's impact significantly. The film should have been shorter and that would've been possible if these absurd scenes were never used in the first place. Unfortunately, the editing is very mediocre and this has drastically affected the overall film. On the flipside, the film's main premise is entertaining and you definitely feel bad for Micheal. The poor chap only received a great when degree of pain after he loses his mother and his village. In addition, he accidentally blinds an innocent girl in the process. The guilt completely shatters him which is definitely very depressing. However, the comedy dilutes the impact of several noteworthy scenes with Micheal.Anu Malik's music is mostly bland with several unnecessary songs. However, there is one rare exception and this is \"Tujhse Kya Chori Hai\". This is a beautiful composition brilliantly crooned by Kumar Sanu and Sadhna Sargam. Action scenes are mostly decent with entertaining hits and kicks. However, Mohra and Sapoot had action which was better choreographed. This film is slightly more violent with a disturbing torture scene. Sunil's Micheal gets a really thrashing from some corrupt cops and it is devastating to say the least.Sunil Shetty performs his role decently. There is a lot of emotion in Micheal and Sunil manages to express without hamming it up completely. It was nice to watch Sunil enact a role with so much emotion. As usual, Sunil excels in the actions sequences. Akshay Kumar does not get a meaty role like Sunil but he is good as the honest cop. His action scenes are a treat to watch. Pran is good as the wronged father of Micheal. Madhoo is good but Shilpa Shirodkar is wasted in a silly role. Jagdeep is okay but his unwanted comedy irritates. Rami Reddy is menacing despite being expressionless for the most part. The others provide decent support.On the whole, Hum Hain Bemisaal is an action film which had potential. If the film was better edited, it would've been a better film. The film may have flopped but it is definitely worth a watch for all Sunil Shetty fans. If the film didn't have Sunil Shetty or Akshay Kumar, it would've been a big turkey.\n",

            "I am surprised why so many people voted so poorly for this film as I personally felt this was a great action adventure film starring Akshay Kumar and Raveena Tandon. Naseeruddin Shah, as always, had a commanding role throughout the film. Overall a fantastic film and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Akshay Kumar films as well as a pretty good filmy kick-ass storyline.Film is about 3 brothers and how one brother being murdered by a group of underworld gangsters results in the remaining 2 brothers taking revenge. The background music is very good and atmospheric. I can think of Sunil Shetty being another actor who would have played an excellent role in such a film. Highly recommended film. A++\n",

The film reminds us of DON(1978) where Ajay the cop is replaced by a crook who is a lookalike. Though the romantic track between Arun and Sapna is well handled, however the villains track is not convincing, they like cartoons, however some scenes between both Ajays are well handled though the end is predictableDirection is below average, though he handles some scenes well Music is superb by Sanjeev-Darshan, title song is superb, Jogiya,Qayamat,Churao Na Dil are all fab Ajay Devgan plays both roles superbly, he brings a nice variation to both roles, Urmila is quite good, Mahima Chaudhary is there throughout though billed as special app and is good Paresh Rawal,Pramod Moutho back again after DILWALE play villain brothers but their track falls flat here, Gulshan Grover and Aasif Sheikh too suffer, Shivaji Satham and others are good\n",

            "After some good blockbusters and hits from 1994, Akshay went through a lean phase and gave some of his worst films ever. Zaalim released in mid 1994 and flopped. But, it was not that bad of a story. The movie was given an A Rating for violence and one molesting scene. But, it was truly unrealistic. The story is decent until a part where things don't make sense and the use of action is not effective for revenge because of the violence. The story goes like this, Akshay Kumar comes from a good family and he is studying law at his college. There is some good family moments and mischief pranks which are truly well handled for a BollyWood movie. The villains doing some kind of karate at their den is shown well(For once the villains are strong), the romantic angle of Madhoo and Akshay is well shown but annoys with the use of songs. The movie falls flat after some of the memebers of Akshay's family is killed and he's Zaalim side is released. He does manage to kill the villains but gets hurt in the process. But, the most unrealistic thing is how can a women manage to flee from goona with a baby in her stomach as shown in the climax when Akshay and Madhoo flee from the villains. The climax is unrealistic and long but the action scenes are superb. The killings are all violent and Akshay's anger is well shown yet the second half of the film is just lots of action put together and less story. The subplots and the direction(in the second half) is a let down. But, the movie apparently still entertains. Amongst actors, Akshay does his decent side and Zaalim side well, Madhoo does okay, villains are all typecast and Mohan Joshi is a good one, aupporting cast is wasted. Music is good, Direction is average, story is good until the second half but catches up at the end but still is not met with expectations. This film was a low budget flop. But, Akshay(even in his bad movies except a few) is superb, this can be put in his average one. Overall, the movie is a flop but it's average(not good)!\n",

Apart from Celina Jaitley in a series of revealing clothes, the film also stars Govinda, Upen Patel and Aftab Shivdasani as three guys trying to get rich in hurry. Bollywood comedies usually turn out to be really funny or really annoying and Money Hai To Honey Hai is really completely annoying, daft, garbage, junk and crap right from start to end of this 2 hours 10 minutes torture device. There is a difference between comedies that require no brains and brainless comedies. The whole movie is dodgy and lacks a single decent joke. The cast couldn't act especially Celina Jaitley who does not even know the ABC of acting. Even the music is rubbish, I disliked every song there is and I usually like at least 1 song of most Bollywood films. Another stupid thing in the movie I noticed is that in the end of the song Jappi Pa the entire crowd disappeared just under 5 seconds before the next shot. Overall I hated everything in this so called comedy, Recommend this movie to someone you really hate.\n",

The characters are two-dimensional, the plot is clunky, the sound is spotty, the directing is uneven... but \"Foxfire\" is worth watching because a previously unknown young actress named Angelina Jolie waltzed onto the set and completely stole this movie.From her memorable entrance, with the camera panning slowly up from her boots, this movie belongs to Jolie. Part riot-grrl James Dean, part goth  Ingrid Bergman, smoldering with sexual tension-- she's simply perfect in this part. The rest of the cast is pretty solid, the indie rock soundtrack is great, and the story manages to avoid being completely predictable... which is pretty rare for a teen flick. \"Foxfire\" is a schlocky movie, to be sure, but it's definitely a guilty pleasure.\n",

            "\"Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai\" the latest sci-fi comedy or love triangle, strengthens my two recent observations about our dear Hindi Cinema. One, that we are ready to experiment with fresh unexplored ideas and story plots, but still don't have the guts to stick to the main subject throughout the 2 hours of its duration. And second, we still take too much time in the initial reels and are not willing to reveal the main theme of our project in the first few minutes itself. Till date we very religiously believe in properly introducing our characters to the audiences, along with a few song and dance sequences for their relief and then come to main plot of the story.That's what happens in JKSAH, when we are not shown the glimpses of the gorgeous lady coming from the other planet anywhere in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Instead we are introduced to the hero, his family, his sex maniac friend who stays with him day and night and his just found lady love from our own earth, in the first half an hour. It was really a strange step taken by the director, to hold up the things for so long when everything from the trailers to the posters were talking about the romance between the boy from earth and a girl from Venus. Still, the saving point is that the proceedings don't let you doze off due to many other interesting elements added by the director Milap Zaveri in the first half. Every key character in the story is working in a film crew, headed by Farah Khan herself in a superb cameo of a typical filmy director. This was indeed an intelligent thought put in by the writers since the viewers always enjoy watching the inside stories happening on a film shoot. The hilarious and witty moments in this particular part keep you alive and one actually doesn't mind waiting for the girl coming from Venus for a while.But the problems start creeping up, when the Alien girl, Jacqueline, arrives on our planet in the most bizarre way. She simply falls from the sky in the arms of Ritesh. Putting it straight, all the excitement of watching an alien girl interacting with the young boy and then loving him, gets shattered due to the lack-luster treatment given by the director to the plot. Within few minutes, the alien girl starts talking, behaving and dressing like any other girl on earth and that takes away all the charm and freshness associated with the novel theme. Moreover the inclusion of the centuries old love triangle sequences in the second half push the movie into further lower platforms than expected. The moment the triangle comes into existence, it steals the entire entertainment factor from the movie and you just feel like waiting when it's going to end. That's what proves to be the real drawback of JKSAH when the director doesn't stick to the amusing narration; he successfully delivers in the first half. And the climax comes as another nail in the coffin since it fails to provide any convincing solution to the alien problem faced by the loving couple.Performance wise, there are few worth mentioning acts in the movie, which mainly include the highly entertaining cameos by the Industry stalwarts such as Farah Khan, Sajid Khan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra and Amrita Rao. An honest performance by Ritesh Deshmukh, who is now known for his mastery over comedy. A confident portrayal of an alien girl by Jacqueline, far better than her last \"Aladin\" and the pleasant presence of Sonal Sehgal who surely deserves to be given some better roles in the future. Apart from these, both Satish Shah and Supriya as Ritesh's parents are able to provide few comic moments in the first half. Vishal is superb as Ritesh's friend and Ruslaan shows signs of improvement in his Bollywood super star's act.Sajid-Wajid's music sounds fine but they are not consistently coming up with some good songs as last heard in Salman's \"Veer\". Camera-work is just all right as the director doesn't seem to be interested in using any kind of major special effects to enhance the overall impact of the story. So, the viewers expecting a good sci-fi romance out of it will be disappointed.Concisely, though it suggests being an out of this world romantic movie involving an alien girl, still it has nothing talking about the space or life on other planets in the universe. The makers opt for a safe way not getting into heavy graphics and animations, but in return come up with a below average product which could have been much better moving around a plot like this. In reality it is just another routine love triangle movie, supported by an alien plot in its storyline. With a marginally good first half and a very poor second one, a Home Video DVD of JKSAH will be the best option to go for in the coming weeks.\n",

The film released 1 year after DON where too Amitabh had a double role and starred with Zeenat. The Great Gambler however didn't work because it was considered too ahead of it's times and the pace was too fast difficult to comprehend for our audiences. The film is handled well, the plot is very complicated and at times makes no sense yet it's interesting. The twists and turns are well handled,The way in which both Amitabhs get mixed up are well handled. The climax shot in goa is superb too Direction is good though the film was not too easy for our audiences to follow Music is a big hit, Do Lafzon by Asha Bhosle is still remembered, Mera Kya Naam Hai sung by Kishore and Asha is good song too, Rakkasa Mera Naam is well choreographed, the rest are 2 item songs which are okay.Amitabh Bachchan as always excels in double roles, however here there is hardly variation in both in terms of looks, voice which does get confusing however he plays Jai Vijay superbly. Zeenat Aman is good in her role, Neetu Singh is good too Amongst rest, Prem Chopra is as usual, Utpal Dutt who in the same year did Golmaal, gives a superb performance in an unusual role where he hums music during serious scenes,Madan Puri, Jagdish Raj, Sujit Kumar are all good, Roopesh Kumar, Iftekar, Om Shivpuri are also good.\n",

            "Akshay Kumar is a great action hero but his selection of movies aren't always good. He has chosen some of the worst movies ever in his whole career from 1992-2013. In the 90s, Akshay Kumar had some big hits and a few blockbusters. His biggest flops were in the 1997-1999 period but in the early and mid 90s, he selected some of his worst films ever. Films like Zakhmi Dil(1994), Mr. Bond(1992), Kayda Kanoon(1993), and Maidaan E Jung(1995) were some of his worst movies. Paandav released in 1995 and it isn't entirely bad but there are so many typical scenes that are badly handled, that the film is a pain to watch.Paandav has some of the most comical and hilarious villains which brings unintentionally comedy. The story is about Akshay Kumar who lives with his brother Mukesh Khanna and sister in law. He has a friend Prithvi and there are several crude comic scenes in the first half which are supposed to be funny but end up being cheap and overdone. The actual trouble and conflicts between the law and the villains is well shown but the handling succumbs to mediocrity whenever the romance and the comedy appear in the film. The forced comedy isn't needed and the romance is boring, the stereotypical elements in the film simply ruin the main conflicts and actual story of the film.Direction by Raj Sippy is awful, he gives Akshay another bad film after Amaanat(1994) another badly handled action film. He handles the main conflict well in parts but the comedy and romance sidelines the main story which drags the film quite a lot. There is no proper flow in the movie and when the flow appears, it doesn't take long for the movie to achieve the no flow goal. What sucks the most is Akshay doesn't fight in this movie that much, all he does is beat people in the police station which makes his action hardly appeal.Akshay Kumar does fairly OK as the stressed out cop but this time, Sippy didn't take his action into credit, the action element of the movie is poor making the film crass. Prithvi is no hero, he is wooden and no wonder he wasn't offered any films after these last roles of his career. The heroines are stupid, no talent at all. Mukesh Khanna is OK in a boring role and his dialog delivery is pathetic. Kiran Kumar and Pankaj Dheer are typecast as the unintentionally comical villains. The rest provide poor support.On the whole, Paandav is a crass action film directed by Raj Sippy, the film could've have been a lot better if Sippy had presented a proper and well handled story with more action, interrogation in the police chamber is not action.\n",

            "I have heard many negative reviews and also am aware of the fact that 'Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswathi' was a major flop during the year of its release. As a child, this was one of my favourite movies and I had the chance to revisit this one after about 17 years and I have got to say that I still find it entertaining but in a way that one would enjoy a campy film. It is so bad that it's good. While it holds nostalgic value for me, it is overall more enjoyable than other campy flicks of the time like the overrated 'Amar Akbar Anthony', 'Mard', 'Coolie' etc (all made by Manmohan Desai). Let's go to the (well intended) good parts. Kader Khan's sharp witty dialogues are hilarious. It's a pity that he doesn't write for movies anymore as many films lack the necessary wit to charm the viewer. Secondly, the performances by Meenakshi Sheshadri, Jaya Prada and Mithun Chokroborty are brilliant. Sheshadri is incredibly beautiful and her Jamunaa is vivacious, charming and streetsmart. Her performance is very natural. Jaya Prada is wonderful as the virgin prostitute, I mean, virgin cabaret singer and dancer in a brothel (confused?) who doesn't dare to dream of getting married and living a decent respectable life with a husband. Chokroborty is a little loud at times but he is impressive when restrained and his unrequited love for Jamunaa is well displayed. It was a welcome change to see Amitabh Bachchan (who was recognized at that time for his on screen angry-man image) a lot more mellow and laidback, even though he's a little too old for his role. Nirupa Roy was the formulaic mother. Amrish Puri is fun as Gangaa's evil maternal uncle. The third strong point, is the beautiful locations. I miss watching those marvelous locales of India that one used to see in older movies. In contrast, nowadays most movies concern themselves either with showing the slums of India or the posh sights of America, Europe and whatever.The music is of the foot-tapping and catchy sort and some of them have very good lyrics. I liked how 'Saajan Mera' and 'Churiyan Khanki' were visualized on the drop dead gorgeous Meenakshi Sheshadri. The movie's got quite a variety of songs: qawali, mujra, semi-bhangra, religious etc. 'Nachegi Saraswati' is another catchy song where of course one sees Jaya Prada dancing on a moving truck (this sequence is an example of one of the worst blue screen filters ever).On the technical side, the special effects are abysmal and the cinematography is flat. The sound effects are poor and so is the lighting at times but it's a colourful movie and all of this adds to the campiness.Aside the expected songs appearing out of nowhere, the random dishum dishum scenes and the gazillion coincidences, you have: Jaya Prada as a virgin prostitute dancing on a moving truck (as mentioned earlier), Amitabh Bachchan doing a Michael Jackson number (this one is laugh out loud material), Meenakshi Sheshadri banging her head on a rock and consequently losing her memory (amnesia being a required Manmohan Desai ingredient), Mithun Chokroborty and Amitabh Bachchan getting two year jail sentences because Amrish Puri had them arrested. Amitabh fighting with crocodiles and carrying one on his back, Meenakshi sleeping in an upside down bathtub, a feather that plays a rat, an unintentionally funny sex scene, a baby falling right inside a tire that rescues him from drowning, Amitabh stopping a fire with an axe, a milk drinking snake, a villain having his head eaten by a crocodile ...and so much more of such fun stuff...how could one not expect a cinematic adventure? :)\n",

            "NAAJAYAZ 1995/ Mahesh Bhatt I was surprised to see Ajay in a film with Juhi Chawla. I didn't know they had ever been co-stars. However it is the presence of Naseeruddin Shah that makes this film quite good and different than the norm. I first saw Naseeruddin Shah in Ijaazat with Rekha when I had just gotten into BW films and was blinded by SRK and more glitzy fantasy. Even though I could see that Naseeruddin Shah was an excellent actor, I was spoiled by SRK's magical appeal and thus missed the man who is obviously one of India's great acting talents with over 120 performances to his credit and still working.The plot of this film is nothing new, but I felt Naseeruddin Shah's presence was somehow forcing the film to be deeper, thus better. You could see how the Ajay-year-1995 had not yet grown into his more subtle acting skills that were to emerge from him  but you could feel him watching and trying to learn from Naseeruddin Shah. Whenever there is a scene in Naajayaz that you feel have \"been there\" before in BW films, you suddenly realize that Naseeruddin Shah is playing it with an intelligence, sensitivity, and depth you normally don't see from the cast of regulars.Reema Lagoo was also quite good in this film and really looking very lovely. I liked her portrayal of Ajay's mom and Shah's faithful beloved.Juhi Chawla is purity itself and she looks so young here. Oh dear, time moves so cruelly on women. She plays a police woman and an undercover cop, shades of One 2 Ka 4, and does some very nice dancing. There is even a scene where she does a sort of Choli Ke Peeche 'heaving-breast' dance Madhuri style. One wonders if this is this the way undercover cops in India traditionally catch criminals  ?For a funky Ajay must-see, there is a dance where he wears what looks like a table-cloth, a baggy t-shirt, and a ski-cap-beany. Yep! Hilarious! He must die of mortification when he looks back on some of these bizarro old dance numbers they had him do -- pre-Malik!There are some very tender moving scenes among all the revenge and madness, along with Ajay doing stunts on motorcycles, lots of exploding trucks, and of course Ajay & Juhi in love. So sweet! This film was a real surprise and I recommend it as a good 1990s BW fare  especially for Ajay, Juhi, and Naseeruddin Shah fans.\n",

            "In the mid-sixties, India faced double trouble. On one hand, Pakistan attacked our frontiers, on the other, there occurred a scarcity of foodgrains in the country. In such a scenario, then prime minister of India, late Laal Bahadur Shastri gave a slogan to the countrymen - Jai Jawaan ! Jai Kisaan ! (hail the soldier, hail the peasant). It was to underscore the importance of both the functions - safeguarding the frontiers as well as increasing the foodgrains production and inspiring the Indians to do something worthwhile for the motherland in any of these two ways. Since he himself was a man of principles and respected throughout the country by one and all, his call for keeping fast on Monday (to reduce consumption of foodgrains) was wholeheartedly responded by the public. And in the war too, India emerged triumphant.Actor Manoj Kumar got the idea of making a film through his slogan only (and the situation prevailing in the country) and he debuted as a filmmaker (producer-director) by making Upkaar (1967) whose script is nothing but the expansion of this slogan only, containing all the Bollywoodish formulae to entertain the typical Indian movie buff.Upkaar (obligation) is the story of a peasant-cum-soldier (Kisaan-cum-Jawaan), Bhaarat (Manoj Kumar) who despite being well-educated, prefers to go for peasantry in his parental village whereas his younger brother (step), Pooran (Prem Chopra) moves out for higher studies and gets spoilt. Bhaarat's maternal uncle (Madan Puri) is a wicked man who had earlier killed their father and now he alongwith the money-lender of the village (Kanhaiyalal) fills poison in the mind of Pooran against his elder brother. Pooran gets separated from the family with his share of the land. Heartbroken Bhaarat gets consolation from his (step) mother, Radha (Kamini Kaushal), his well-wisher, Malang Chacha (Pran) and a lady doctor, Kavita (Asha Parekh). He gets engaged to Kavita. However Pakistan's attack on the nation provides him an opportunity to serve the motherland in a different form. He joins army and gets badly wounded in the war. To his greatest pain, his hands are removed in the surgical operation to save his life. However, Pooran realizing his fault becomes the ointment for his heartache. Pooran returns back to the family and becomes a peasant.The title refers to the obligation of the motherland upon its citizens and indicates that we should be ready to repay the obligation whenever the need arrives. The importance of the land (which was considered no less revered than the mother in the traditional Indian villages) as well as peasantry has been underscored pretty well in the movie albeit in a filmy way. And the hero's character as Kisaan (peasant) is more powerful than his character as Jawaan (soldier) in the later part of the movie.This maiden directorial venture of Manoj Kumar is the best product served by him to the Indian audience because in none of his later movies, he could touch the heights that he achieved in this movie. It is because the script of this movie is very good (courtesy the slogan of the then Indian premier). Since Manoj Kumar's approach towards patriotism has always been superficial and loud (pseudo, to be exact), he could not make great patriotic movies and always presented formula-based flicks. Upkaar is no exception. Here also entertainment only is delivered in the colourful packing of patriotism but this fact is not felt by the viewer.Family bonds have been dealt with in this movie in a very sentimental and impressive manner. The relation between the brothers and how money and personal ambitions break it, is simply touching. The climax is also very sentimental and impressive.Kalyanji Anandji's music is one of the greatest assets of this movie. It contains the evergreen patriotic song - Mere Desh Ki Dharti Sona Ugle Ugle Heere Moti (sung by Mahendra Kapoor) for which lyricist - Gulshan Bawra had got the national award. Deewaano Se Ye Matt Poochho (Mukesh), Har Kushi Ho Jahaan Tu Jahaan Bhi Rahe (Lata) and Aayi Jhoom Ke Basant (Asha, Manna Dey etc.) are other notable popular songs. However my personal favourite is Kasme Vaade Pyar Wafa, Sab Baaten Hain Baaton Ka Kya (Manna Dey).Manoj Kumar became Bhaarat forever for the movies of his banner with Upkaar. He has done well and in my view, this is the second best acting performance of his career (the best is in Shaheed). Asha Parekh, Kamini Kaushal, Prem Chopra (who has always been an integral part of Manoj Kumar's movies), Aruna Irani (a village girl, engaged to Pooran), Manmohan (Dr. Kavita's brother), David (army major) etc. have done well. The baddies (and the comedians) are over the top.But the character that became immortal with this movie is Malang Chacha who gave a pleasant turn to the career of the most hated villain of Bollywood, Pran. Pran has performed the role of the handicapped, carefree and outspoken Malang Chacha so well that you can never forget him after watching this movie. The song - Kasme Vaade Pyar Wafa has been picturized on him only.Frankly speaking, Upkaar is sheer entertainment wrapped in patriotism. Still the movie is highly admirable and despite the change in times, relevant even today in several ways. The family bonds, the importance of the ancestral property, the love for the motherland, the sentiment of sacrifice etc. have not got outdated with time. It still appeals and should not be missed by the people interested in watching golden oldies. It has a great repeat value and the first time watcher will definitely like to watch it again.\n",

With too much unnecessary glamour, body expose, theatrical performances and average musical score, MPKDH did not have anything worthwhile to offer to the audience who approached the theatres with high expectations and quite naturally, it bombed on the box office. However anybody who has been following the movies of Sooraj's banner (actually his grandfather's banner) - Rajshri Productions, could easily see that MPKDH was actually an urbanized remake of an old classic of this banner which kept the flag of simplicity, high values of life and Indianness high in Hindi cinema for around two and a half decades. The original classic movie in this context is Chitchor (1976).Chitchor (heart-stealer) is a lovely movie which got turned into an unforgettable one by the brilliant performances and the excellent music. The pivotal character of the story is Geeta (Zarina Wahaab) who lives with her parents in a small town. Her father, Pitambar Chaudhary (A.K. Hungal) is a schoolmaster who alongwith her mother (Deena Paathak) is concerned about her marriage (like any traditional Indian parents). Her married elder sister, Meera (Ritu Kamal) informs them from Mumbai (then Bombay) a suitable boy who is an engineer, is coming to their place for work and he should be welcomed and treated properly by them to woo him for consenting to marry Geeta. The parents do the same. The arriving person is Vinod (Amol Palekar) who does not know the background behind his welcome and hospitality but through his nature and behaviour he is able to win the hearts of all including that of Geeta. But the twist in the tale comes when the case turns out to be that of mistaken identity. Actually, the person who was suggested by Meera as the prospective groom for Geeta is Sunil (Vijayendra Ghaatage) and not Vinod who is not engineer but his subordinate overseer. Sunil also arrives at the place and now Geeta's parents are in a fix as to how to deal with Vinod whom they had been treating as their prospective son-in-law because quite naturally, the (more) suitable boy is the engineer and not the overseer, forg tting the fact that the heart of a girl once gone for a boy, it's gone. She cannot change her feelings according to the post and the status of the boys. After an emotional drama, the movie reaches its happy ending when Geeta asserts herself and disallows others to decide her destiny.This simple yet highly touching love story has been penned by Subodh Ghosh which ace director, Basu Chatterjee has adapted for the screen with finesse by writing the screenplay and the dialogs himself. It's the simplicity of the story, the characters and the complete milieu which makes this movie a winner all the way. The characters are innocent ones with hearts of gold and they effortlessly take the viewer away with their talks, gesture and activities towards the desired culmination of the story. The spectator becomes a part of their psyche, desiring the same which is bound to happen ultimately.This was the first movie of Vijayendra Ghatage whereas Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahaab too were in the initial phase of their respective careers only. And all three have delivered outstanding performances with ample support from seasoned character artists like A.K. Hungal and Deena Paathak and also from the number one child artist of his time, Master Raju. This movie despite Rajshri's penchant for the traditional social values prevailing in India (which expect the daughter of the house to bow before the decision of her parents regarding her marriage), surprisingly makes the audience hear the footsteps of the woman-lib movement in which the girl wants to decide her groom herself. Zarina Wahaab with her girl next door looks, has delivered a highly confident performance in her role which, in the climax, set the bells of woman-lib ringing for the middle class Indian girls who wanted to be the decider for their fate but could not, being caught in the shackles of social tradition where the parents only could decide what's good for them. This way, it was a path-breaker in the regular Bollywood cinema.The movie could not be such a grand success as well as considered a classic if not for the unforgettable music of Ravindra Jain. This blind music maestro not only composed great melodies based on classical Raagas but also wrote heart-soothing lyrics of high literary quality for them. Gori Tera Gaaon Bada Pyaara, Tu Jo Mere Sur Mein Sur Mila Le and Aaj Se Pehle Aaj Se Zyaada Khushi Aaj Tak Nahin Mili. If you ask for my favourite song from this movie, it's Jab Deep Jale Aana, Jab Shaam Dhale Aana which is based on Raag Yaman. Ravindra Jain introduced K.J. Yesudaas and Hemlata as playback singers from this album.True to its title, this movie is a CHITCHOR who will steal your heart.\n",

            "It is perhaps Vinod's best movie. Vinod was a talented and original actor but it was pity that he left the film industry for a long interval. This interruption caused much damage to his career otherwise he might be among great heroes. Dayavan is a good movie telling the crude realities of criminal and poor life. Perhaps it is a remake of Kamal Hassan's movie and Vinod is successful in recreating the character of Shakti. Film runs on pace and plot twists grip the movie-goer but the last part of the movies seems a bit weak. Perhaps discredit goes to Adita Pancholi's weak acting. Overall, movies is worthy to be collectd and a must see for those who want real life action and story.\n",

            "Director Chandan Arora hits gold with his debut film, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, an unusual, self-reflexive look at Bollywood's reality versus its public image and the dreams it fosters.The story concerns an innocent girl named Chukti (Antara Mali), who lives in the farming village hinterlands of India and who loves the work of Bollywood star Madhuri Dixit. Most of the village turns out during their free time to watch the latest films on a makeshift screen in a makeshift theater. Chukti has a talent for mimicking Dixit, a fact she exploits by putting on public performances of her own--dancing on a small stage to Dixit songs playing on a boom-box. Chukti dreams of moving to Mumbai and becoming a film heroine. Of course her parents are traditional, so they won't hear anything of it. When they realize she's serious enough to consider running away, they plan to marry her off as soon as possible.Enter Rajeshwar Singh (Rajpal Yadav). He's the only person in the village who sincerely believes in Chukti, and he's also in love with her, although she seems oblivious to it--she only cares about becoming a star. He suggests that if he can talk his father into arranging a marriage between them (which they'll keep secretly platonic), he'll take her to Mumbai as his wife. There, they can pursue Chukti's dream.The bulk of the film is about Chukti trying to make it in Bollywood. The dramatic hinge is the clash of her dreams with the realities of the film business and big city life.This is a unique film in that it forgoes many of the staples of the Bollywood genre. Yes, there are songs, there is a romance of sorts, and there is even a kind of love triangle, but these are all very unusually incorporated. The songs are exclusively present for realistic, dramatic purposes. Songs only appear when characters are engaging in stage performances, \"celebrations\" with music, film performances, and so on. Arora always has the music at a level of remove--we're watching people watching or engaging in performances. The romance aspect is almost exclusively implicit. There is something of a resolution to it in the end, but the resolution is extremely subtle--it basically amounts to a character putting on a piece of jewelry, and the action easily enables multiple interpretations. The \"love triangle\" takes place between the party who \"secretly\" loves Chutki and a party who is only trying to manipulate her dreams to take advantage of her. It is resolved in an incredibly powerful dramatic moment that in a lesser film would be followed up with a clichéd vengeance subplot. Here, it's not brought up again--this says much more than the stereotype would.\"Incredible dramatic power\" is apt for much of the film, even though there are extended comedic segments, as well. Most of Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon is constructed more like a tragedy with brief comic relief. All of the plot developments are very realistic. And as such, the theme of the film is often a \"necessary medicine\" disillusioning from unrealistic dreams. Some might think it is a flaw that most characters are slightly caricatured in the film. However, it is not as if there aren't people in the real world like this. There is no shortage of the relatively naïve, coming from the heartland to Los Angeles, New York City, and presumably Mumbai, hoping to make it big in a stroke, yet having very little knowledge of how the arts and entertainment industries work. For another example, it's certainly not the case only in fiction that some parents are bilked out of money via funding requests from their offspring for non-existent projects and studies. That the film is so unique should be expected once one realizes that it was produced by Ram Gopal Varma. Varma is well known for advocating breaks from various Bollywood traditions that have become clichéd. He's made films completely void of musical numbers. He's made films without romance elements. He's made films with vastly different pacing and plot structures than the typical Bollywood film. There's nothing wrong with the traditional Bollywood formula, except that variety is necessary. Varma is doing much to set the Indian film industry on the right road in that regard.So it's fitting that Varma is behind this well-acted, well-directed, well-photographed, etc. film that looks at Bollywood with a critical eye. It is just as intriguing for its insights into the real world of film-making as it is for its plot about Chukti and Raja. Varma and Arora show us that often, a director is more someone who merely tries to keep a lid on burgeoning chaos, partially emerging from underlings who'll make stupid decisions in an attempt to please, and partially from \"grunts\" who don't know what the heck they're doing. They show us the complicated world of agents who mean well, but who have to be shysters a bit because it's in the job description. They show us how catty and competitive other entertainers can be. They show us the realities of working one's way up. They show us the difference between image, such as the idea that Bollywood, or even Hollywood, is some kind of glamorous, unified entity, and the scattered, somewhat grungy reality--Chukti and Raja have to live in a rat-hole, next door to someone who has been involved with over 50 films, and some participants don't even live in the same country. They show us how important it is to learn to take rejection. They show us a transparent look at studio guards and security. They show us that manipulative/exploitative fraud isn't limited to the entertainment industry. And so on.Whether you just want a unique, humorous, powerful and moving film about charming characters, or an \"inside\" look at the film industry, or a bit of both, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon fits the bill.\n",

During the freedom struggle, though freedom is won but, he looses Bharati - who leaves as she is affected by leprosy. He is given shelter in Bharat Nagar - as four underworld dons of Bharat Nagar (representing east - great bengali actor Uttam Kumar - who died during filiming the movie and the rest of his role was played by hair dresser to Amitabh Bachchan), west (Parikshit Sahani), north (Shammi Kapoor) and south (Prem Nath)). However, his son (again played by Amitabh) right from childhood realizes that the dons are using his father's stay in Bharat Nagar to cover up their wrong doings. So he starts \"hafta-wasooli\" and grows up just opposite of his father. He is mistakenly married to Hema Malini while trying to run away from police hides behind \"sehra\" in a mass marriage ceremony organized by his \"Father\".How the son and the Bharat Nagar is reformed that is rest of the story.Lot of massala is there and that include Amitabh Bachchan mimicking his idol \"Mehmood\"!Overall load of fun!\n",

The film was made so well and shows that Asians & blacks not only get harmed physically but also emotionally e.g. there things get broken or thrown away & eggs thrown on there face. The movie started off really interesting when the Sikh couple arrived at there bus stop late at night and where chased by the skinheads. During their funeral I felt really sorry for the victim's father when he said that his son's face has been cut so badly that he couldn't recognise him. In the scene when the boy's head was shaved and covered in flour, the suspense was killing me when he arrived at home panting and everyone were shockingly looking at him one at a time and I didn't have a clue that what did the skinheads did to him. The fight in the end was the best scene in the film because Sohail Khan was beaten-up very badly and we thought that he was finished but then his father animated him and he defeated Kane, on top of all that he was also arrested for murder. Sohail Khan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and the actors who played Aslam Firoz & Kane were the best throughout the whole film.\n",

            "For friends, who may not be familiar with the original source of the movie \"Bumm Bumm Bole\", it's an Official remake of Majid Majidi's world famous Iranian masterpiece \"Children of Heaven\" or\"Bacheha-Ye Aseman\" released in 1997, which was also nominated in the Best Foreign Film Category at the Oscars. Majid is one of the most renowned new age directors of World Cinema with a simple but unique vision of film- making. Influenced by his magical art, Priyadarshan, the man behind many recent hit comedies, returns with his own version of the classic featuring the incomparable Darsheel Safary in the lead role.Keeping its remake status in mind, I would like to review the movie in two different sections here. One, as an individual piece of art attempted by the Indian team of film-makers and Two, as the Official Remake of Majid Majidi's emotional gem.As a children movie alone, \"Bumm Bumm Bole\" is not at all impressive as it should have been, considering its unusual emotional storyline about a brother and sister. It somehow comes out with the same results as previously seen in \"Sikander\" released in 2009. In fact it even starts exactly in the same manner as \"Sikander\" where a child gets killed in a bomb blast planned in the busy market. And after this clichéd opening, the movie keeps moving at a slow pace till its climax, without any crescendo kind of impact created by the director. Besides this, the concluding moments showcasing a children marathon race, simply fall flat in absence of any emotions, thrill or excitement factor put in by the writers. Moreover the over exposure of the brand \"Adidas\" in several scenes, looks quite over the top, irresponsible and unexpected from the well known director, Priyadarshan.However, the major flaw of the movie remains that instead of sticking to its original plot of the shoe exchange between the two kids, the screenplay tries to incorporate many other unwanted sub-plots into the narration which look forced and completely misfit. For instance, What is the use of showing a rape attempt, bomb blasts, terrorist link ups, encounters and cold-blooded murders in a movie which is supposed to be a Children's FLICK. Does the director thinks that these all elements are necessary to fit-in, even when you are making a film around two innocent and poor kids. And does he consider it to be fine enough to be watched by the kids in the age-group of 5 to 15. I sincerely doubt it and would strongly like to vote against any such venture which plays around with the psyche of all those \"Still not stuffed young minds\".Hence for that matter, \"Bumm Bumm Bole\" was a big unpleasant surprise for me as it was not at all interested in talking about its main storyline revolving around the two kids. On the contrary, the brilliant performances of both Darsheel Safary and Ziyah Vastani do not turn out to be that powerful, mainly due to the other sub plots interfering in their scenes together at regular intervals. Both Atul Kulkarni and Rituparna Sengupta also try their best to contribute in this prestigious project, but their underwritten characters don't allow them to do anything exceptional on the screen. As a result, the final outcome is not able to touch the viewer emotionally and he just moves out of the theater unmoved and unimpressed.Interestingly, as I see it, the movie can be easily edited out again to get a completely different version, which only depicts the relationship between the two children and their parents. And that I think would be more precise, complete and to the point version, as demanded by its innocent theme written by Majid Majidi himself. Also this new edit would in turn reduce the over-length of the movie which happens to be another drawback of this dismal attempt by the Indian team.Now comparing \"Bumm Bumm Bole\" with its Original Source \"Children of Heaven\".. it sadly stands nowhere around the excellence achieved by the simplistic vision of Majid Majidi. In other words it's extremely difficult to be as simple yet impressive as Majid and his movies. In this context, I also remember the quote of a well known film-maker which says that, \"Cinematic masterpieces get made accidentally and they cannot be ever remade as a version with the same genius.\"That's exactly the case with \"Bumm Bumm Bole\" where it seems nothing close to its Original Iranian classic and just remains another version attempted by a successful director of Hindi Cinema. Priyadarshan very carelessly wastes the innocent plot of two kids using the same pair of shoes for their school among the other rotten sub-plots in the script. Strangely, he never cares to elaborate on the time structure of the two school shifts and neither he focuses on the relationship between the four family members in specific. Also the premises of the story remains confused between Assam and Kashmir with people wearing misleading outfits in the backdrop. Still, the cinematography is excellent and the two kids are a pleasure to watch.Summing up, I would like to inform that few years back there was another Hindi Version of this Classic made in the year 2006 with the title \"Salaam Bachhe\". It was a kind of B-C grade movie which completely followed Majid's masterpiece scene by scene. Strictly speaking where this 2006 version was A Brutal Murder of the Original, the present 2010 version is a Soft Murder of the same.So watch \"Bumm Bumm Bole\".only if you want to ruin the immense pleasure, satisfaction and joy of watching Majid Majidi's \"Children of Heaven\".\n",

            "Controversial, graphic, violent, unsettling, disturbing, devastating & disgusting but an underrated cinema nonetheless that dares to explore the darkest side of adult industry, there's no denying that A Serbian Film is destined to upset majority of viewers with its gross, sickening & utterly discomforting subject matter which is exactly its motive but looking beyond its on- screen depiction of every taboo, it's also a pretty bold piece of filmmaking.Set in Serbia, the film tells the story of Milos; a well-past-his-prime porn star who's happily married & has a son but the family is going through financial difficulties. Contacted by one of his former colleagues who has a job offer for him, Milos is introduced to the new director & finally agrees to participate in an \"art film\" only to discover that he's been drafted into making a pedophilia & necrophilia themed snuff film.Brilliantly directed, fairly performed, effectively paced, superbly handling the elements of suspense & featuring many deeply disturbing sequences from start to finish, A Serbian Film is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the easily distressed or even a completely normal human being plus its so-called political allegory is nothing but an excuse to justify the pervertedness depicted here as the only reason why this film exists is to shock the viewers in the name of art.Yet, a story like this needed to surface on the screen not because it has a motive but because it represents a far darker side of world which most people choose to ignore, despite being aware of its existence. On an overall scale, A Serbian Film is an extremely unnerving story about porn industry but is definitely not porn plus it isn't afraid to jump deep into the abyss & bring everything to the surface, which it manages to do in an unflinching manner.Yes it's going to leave you emotionally scarred & No, you don't have to watch it just for the sake of it. Make your mind multiple times before you hit the play button and for those who think they can handle this stuff, just when you'll be thinking that this sadistic experience is finally over & you're almost out of this dark tunnel, the final line just before the end credits will do enough damage to break all hell loose.

            "What's the matter with Mr. Ram Gopal Varma? Surely a man who once directed cult films like Shiva (1989), Raat (1992), Satya (1998), Kaun? (1999), Bhoot (2003) & Phoonk (2008) can do better than this.But since then his directing capability is seriously in doubt. I think he should refrain from directing any more films and stick to producing them instead.Plot of film: it is about a spirit of a girl(or entity) that lives in a house and likes to possess the body of any child that it makes contact with.We see Tarun, an architect, moving into a luxurious bungalow with his wife, Namrata, and their children, 10-year-old Taman and 6-year-old Nimmi. During an exploration of the house, Nimmi finds a doll, and includes someone named 'Shabbu' in all her activities. The family mistakes Nimmi's new doll to be Shabbu but are surprised when Nimmi points to an empty space and introduces her invisible friend as Shabbu. Her parents suspect her wild imagination as the reason for her new 'friend'.Soon, Tarun's younger sister, Pooja, surprises the family with a visit. As Tarun, Namrata and Pooja discuss Nimmi's fixation over Shabbu, the family servant, Laxman, is sure of a spirit's presence in the house. Laxman's worries receive severe backlash from Tarun, an ardent rationalist. Soon, each night at the bungalow seems to turn for the worse, with knocks at unearthly hours, demonic sounds and eerie movements. Tarun suspects Laxman to be the mischief-maker, trying to prove his points. As Nimmi's fixation with Shabbu increases, the family decides to consult a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist explains Nimmi's imaginary friend as a result of her loneliness and terms it as a common technique used by children to grab attention.Laxman's sudden disappearance and the increasing curiosity in Pooja to find answers for the ongoing activities make her install wireless cameras at various places in the house, which record Nimmi playing with what seems like a ghostly apparition. Tarun's mind starts reeling as he sees the captured footage; it is proof enough for the disturbed family to finally decide to leave the house. But the house has other plans: Nimmi is found missing the next morning. The police are called in to investigate but they consider the family delusional and do not take much interest in the matter.Tarun receives a mysterious phone call, after which they find Laxman murdered. The house seems to be on lock-down and the phones jammed. Taman is mysteriously killed. Nimmi appears possessed by the spirit and tries to kill both her parents, until she's finally burned and defeated as the remaining family flee, bloody and injured. Nimmi then introduces herself as Shabbu to the neighborhood children.Cast: We see J.D. Chakravarthy in an ineffectual role as well as Manisha Koirala. The acting is highly dubious. Manisha Koirala tries hard but the script and plot is so bad that even these established actors cannot make the film work. I was especially disappointed with the Satya star J.D. Chakravarthy. I wonder why Varma chose Manisha Koirala over Urmila Matondkar. Urmila is excellent in these roles. Also Manoj Bajpai would have been a better choice over J.D. Chakravarthy.Script: bogus. The climax itself is laughable to seasoned horror veterans. If I was a director I wouldn't have directed a film with a pathetic script like this.Effects: lack of decent special effects. You need a very scary atmosphere for a horror film to work. The camera-work is also dull and does nothing to improve the mood of the film.Verdict: this film is an insult to the fans of Varma who have watched good films of his in the past. Don't waste time or money on this film.Hindi Horror Cult Films: Sannata, Darwaza, Purani Haveli, Veerana, Tahkhana, Dak Bangla, Guest House, Purana Mandir, Bandh Darwaza, Saamri, Shaapit, 1920.Most of these films can be viewed/downloaded for free on Youtube and hindilinks4u.net.\n",

Avtaar not only was a huge commercial hit, but it is a film that was very highly reviewed. It is unfortunate that Rajesh Khanna had to miss out on the Best Actor award to another great acting performance of 1983, Naseeruddin Shah for Masoom.

            "Akshay Kumar was a good action hero but he was a flawed actor initially. His stunts were always good but his acting was raw and this rawness was a disadvantage initially. However, Akshay improved with each film. Akshay's first three films didn't click but Khiladi brought him to the top and got him noticed. 1993 was a lull period for Akshay because most of his films(with the exception of Waqt Hamara Hai) were flops. Ashaant was his first release and despite the wonderfully choreographed action and a decent story of a cop, the film failed at the box office.Ashaant is the story of a frustrated cop who can't solve the crimes in Bangalore due to the pressure from his seniors and the corrupt officials. When Vijay actually does harm the villains by ruining some of their businesses, Vijay's close friend is killed. Vijay watches his friend die and he can't do a thing because his path is blocked by a gate. The rest of the film is how a completely stressed out and frustrated Vijay finds and murders Rana(the villain) with the help of a police inspector.The concept of Ashaant is the same but this old age formula has been well handled in several parts. Producer turned Director Keshu Ramsay directs several scenes well. The game plan of Vijay and the cops is well handled, the romance is well handled for once(compared to most Bollywood films), and the action is simply superb. Music is mainly good because of the one hit song Ghadi Mera Dil which was well choreographed song as well. The death scene of Pankaj Dheer is well handled and the final action sequence is superb.Akshay Kumar rocks as Vijay, the only problem is he hams it up badly in a few scenes. The scene in the hospital where he cries as his close friend dies is poorly acted by him. Those days, Akshay wasn't good at emoting and the overacting was slightly disappointing. Otherwise, Akshay rocks in every scene. When he talks like a smart cop, he is brilliant. The final action scene where he single handedly fights Rana is awesome, this is the kind of raw action I want in Bollywood films nowadays. The heroines Ashwini Bhave and Mamta Kulkarni are decent but Mamta Kulkarni has a very short role. Kanada superstar Vishnuvardhan is good but his role lacks the meat if you compare him with Akshay Kumar. Pankaj Dheer is good and he doesn't ham it up like he did in Mr. Bond(1992) as Daaga. Punnet Issar as Rana is good, his physique is simply superb and he looks like a cruel villain. The rest provide decent support.On the whole, Ashaant(1993) is one of those Akshay Kumar films that went unnoticed despite being decent. The film should've been a hit but it lost out to other films which were hyped.\n",

            "Movies from Sudhir Mishra's basket as always stand apart from the rest of the crowd. The subjects he chooses, the characters he brings to life and the way he presents them on the celluloid has always been different. And Khoya Khoya Chaand is no different. This time around he attempts a period movie against the backdrop of the Indian film Industry (I would abstain from using the word Bollywood as I very much doubt if the term existed in 1960's). He takes bits and pieces from the film magazines, scandals, rumours and biographies to weave a plot and base it on the love-story between the writer/director and the actress. Sounds familiar? Well, fact meets fiction and a thin line separates the two. For a novice it would seem KKC is a tale taking snippets predominantly from the lives of Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Meena Kumari, Nargis, Kamal Amrohi, Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar. And perhaps more, if one were to ask an expert on the subject. As with Sudhir Mishra's movies he infuses the grey shades to the characters owing to which they flesh out very much true-to-life. ם Shiny Ahuja:: Does a good job. Its evident that his character loosely inspired on the life of Guru Dutt and perhaps Raj Kapoor.ם Soha Ali Khan:: Quite a matured performance indeed. Her character has many layers and safely manages to deliver the goods. I am sure the inputs from Mum must have helped.ם Vinay Pathak:: Initially you feel the actor is wasted in a pathetic character, but in second half the character gains momentum.ם Rajat Kapoor:: As usual dependable. ם Sonya Jehan:: Extremely pretty however her performance seemed very plastic. The set, makeup, songs, dances, costumes (and even the telephone ring) transport you into the era of 60's. Everybody who has contributed to the movie deserves to be acknowledged for the valiant effort. KKC is not Om Shanti Om, the goody-goody glorified industry, it is not Bollywood Calling, the dark satire and neither Luck By Chance which portrays the industry from the struggler's perspective but yes - it belong to the same genre. It does not shy away to tell the darker side of the industry and attempts to realistically portray the picture behind the iron wall without being derogatory. The movie caters to a cross-section of audience hence there is hardly any room for commercial or wider acceptance.\n",

            "I still fail to understand what this was all about, but I totally regret having watched Maidan-E-Jung. The film is highly melodramatic, the proceedings, the dialogues and the characters are very theatrical and overdone, and above all, the story itself does not make any sense. The film presents really crude and fairy tale villains who do not have the slightest chance to exist in reality. The casting is really tactless. Dharmendra is cast in a role of a young man when he's already 60, and Karisma plays his sister while she could well be his daughter, if not granddaughter. Akshay Kumar is the ordinary guy who sings songs for his beloved and is there to fight for her whenever necessary. The film's only saving grace is the music, namely one song called \"Shaam Dhal Rahi\" which is really beautiful. Other than that, I highly recommend anyone to avoid this movie at any cost. This is a terrible B-grade movie which offers zero substance and zero entertainment.\n",

            "This tired remake of Hollywood's 'Point of no return' is a decade behind its point. Bobby Deol is great as an assassin out to avenge the deaths of both his father and his mentor but he is also wasted in the role as he is too good for a tired action drama such as this. The equally brilliant Priyanka Chopra is also wasted in a role as his love interest who is given nothing to do other than endlessly parade about in beautiful Sarees and pout. The best part of the movie happens at the beginning on a train when a girl about to be raped by a goon turns out to be an undercover hired assassin (a rare occurrence by all Indian standards) but don't get your hopes high as the film goes downhill from there. The music is quite good but even it cannot carry the film. Don't get too attached to any characters either unless you like your heart being broken.

Akhilendra Mishra reprises the usual character he normally does but for those who are expecting a funny bone from Vinay Pathak, be warned. He is serious as any patriarch can be, proving he is damn good at what he envelopes. Raj Singh Chaudhary as Raghu Veer and Swati Sen as Janki deliver great performances. Himanshi as Sia represents urban bred girlfriend whose segment is narrated in flashbacks.The entire team of \"Antardwand\" deserve to be applauded for a brave attempt.

            "Circumstances leading two brothers on the different sides of law has been a much contrived plot in Indian Movies, \"Deewar,\" among the names to list. Well, \"Gunga Jumna\" is the predecessor in this theme. Given a rustic rural backdrop and Bhojpuri dialect, the film sparks in terms of art, storytelling, or performances. DIlip Kumar, Vaijyantimala, and Kanhaiyalal all make bravura performances. There are emotions and wit spread along, nuanced through the mesmerising cinematic frames the film creates. Abundance of songs and dances stretches the film a bit, but doesn't reduce the pleasure the film overall imparts. After \"Mother India,\" it's a film which deserves to be archived for the pure Indianism the film tries to canvass.Rating: 3 stars out of 4\n",

            "Akshay Kumar without any doubt is a talented actor, he has many movies to his credit. However, he has many horrible movies to his credit too. Some of his early movies are known to be absolute duds at the box office. These films from the early 90s witnessed only decent performances from Akki but in general the whole movies would be nothing but letdowns. In the year 1992, Akshay continued his journey at the box office after the debut of Saugandh which didn't quite work at the box office. 1992 promised to be the same if Akshay wouldn't have received a miracle from Abbas Mustaan in the name of Khiladi. This film not only gave him a superhit but was his actual launch for him, this movie made him. This movie was equal to even 20 flop films of his from the time as those flops didn't stop him from getting noticed. His hits kept on happening and despite the flops and a few disasters, his career got comebacks.Kayda Kanoon is another flop film of Akshay Kumar's from the year 1993. During the early 90s, Akshay had only Khiladi that got him noticed and gave him lots of offers. These offers he accepted sadly turned out to be flops. It was the Khiladi series and a few other low budget hits that helped him move on and succeed as a Bollywood actor.Anyways, Kayda Kanoon is one of his not so good films from 1993. In fact, none of his film from 1993 suceeded except Waqt Hamara Hai which was with his not so good friend Sunil Shetty. Akki and Sunil became friends after 2000 when their rivarly kind off ended.Kayda Kanoon is another Bollywood film where Akshay plays the police officer who gets wronged and then he teams up with another wronged person to murder all the corrupt villains. This is the basic story and yes it is not anything memorable as it is the same typical story except it is 2 action heroes this time. However, I find Akki superior to Sudesh as Sudesh isn't really a good actor, he is more of a clichéd television actor.Acting is quite average, Akshay Kumar does a good job though he was quite raw during his early days. But he does well and entertains for the most part. His action scenes are a delight, those days action used to be good. Anupam Kher does a good job and his realization is quite realistic. The others like Kader Khan, Sudesh Behry and the clichéd heroine Farheen all disappoint.Direction by Pradeep Mini is quite outdated, the film seems to be like it from the 80s with clichéd scenes, clichéd dialogs, annoying comedy.The only plus points are a few of the dialogs, Akshay's action and his acting to a certain extent, and a few songs.On the whole, Kayda Kanoon is good for a one time watch, but for the most part is a below average film.\n",

            "Certainly it's another watch worthy movie from Trivikram and Vijay Bhaskar combination. But some how it could not live up to the sky high expectations for a Megastar Chiranjeevi. Satyanarayana Murthy ( Chiranjeevi ) hails from Amalapuram and comes to Hyderabad seeking revenge for his niece murder which was happened in a park while Arbaz Khan testing his one of his newly purchased Guns (inspired from Hollywood flick Jackal *ing Bruce Willies ) . With the help of his sidekick Venumadhav, he tries to find the master mind behind his niece's murder plot. He stays in an apartment complex and befriends Shailaja ( Sameera Reddy ), who is living with her parents. Eventually they fall in love. Soon Sathyanarayana Murthy realizes that the master mind behind his niece's death was an internationally operating Arm dealer ( Arbaz Khan ) staying in USA. Now he seeks the help of Neelima ( Bhumika Chawla) to go to USA. Neelima is an NRI, whose father was also a victim of Arbaz Khan's activities. Finally the movie ends as Satyanarayana Murthy taking revenge by killing Arbaz Khan. Actor Performance: Chiranjeevi : (Satyanarayana murthy ). Its really cakewalk for Megastar doing comedy and action role. The scenes where Chiru adopts himself to the city lifestyle with the help of Venumadhav are quite hilarious. His natural ability to dance is clearly shown in all the songs, especially in the \"title\" song and Thillana Song. The kidnap episode of Sunil (son of a mafia goon, Jaya Prakash Reddy) has some rib tickling moments. Once again Chiru proved his drunken acting skills which always have been his forte.Sameera Reddy ( Shailaja ) : Its very obvious that she is very poor at acting. She also failed entertaining audience with her much hyped sex appeal. Surprisingly she coped up really well with Chiru in dance. Bhoomika Chawla ( Neelima ): Despite getting really short footage, she did justice to the role of an NRI girl. Arbaz Khan: He is adequate as a villain, who ironically recites slokas from epics while killing the people. Venumadhav, Sunil and Bramhanandam: Comedy by Venu, Sunil and Bramhanandam has some sharp and witty dialogues. This is another typical role for comedy legend Bramhanandam (like Nuvvu naaku nachav and Manmadhudu ) . This is the most refreshing part of the movie. One could definitely feel that Bramhanadam should have been introduced a bit early in the movie. Technical department: Music by Manisharma has some foot tapping numbers. Camera work is OK. Choreography is really good for couple of songs ( Thillana and Jai Jai ganesha ) . Screenplay by Vijaybhaskar is not up to the mark. He failed miserably in maintaining tempo in this revenge backdrop movie. As usually dialogues by Trivikram are good. Finally, this movie leaves the viewers much to desire for. This is not a suitable subject for Chiranjeevi. Sameera Reedy is a big letdown. One gets the impression that writer-director duo who have been very successful with their previous ventures could not make a plot that suits chiru's image well. Bottom line . its worth watching.P.S :: We happened to be part of the movie in the second half ( just couple mins before Thillana Thillana Song that was shot in Las Vegas)\n",

            "In mid-August, many an unknowing filmi buff was psychologically impaled in the cinema halls during screenings of Karan Johar's hopelessly awful \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" which purported to be a mature examination of extra-marital affairs. It was, of course, nothing of the sort, and despite raking in the moolah, it has found little favor with fans or critics.About a month later, a comparatively small budget film, Onir's \"Bas Ek Pal\" (reminiscent of experimental European cinema), released, dealing with a similar theme but without any of the reigning puerility and adolescent conventionality which made Johar's film so utterly absurd. Instead, Onir infuses his film with a complex morality and a matrix of thoroughly realistic characters where there are no heroes and no villains, no glamorized damsels and no bitchy mistresses. It is also impossible to say who is opposite whom- there are no \"pairs\" as one is universally accustomed to seeing in Indian films. A brief recap of the premise will explain why: The story begins with the reunion of two friends, Nikhil (Sanjay Suri) and Rahul (Jimmy Shergill). Nikhil becomes acquainted with Steve (Rehaan Engineer), a friend of Rahul's who is also an abusive alcoholic. Steve is married to Ira Malhotra, a former beauty queen turned humanitarian (Juhi Chawla) who has suffered a miscarriage, physical battery, and a failed marriage. Nikhil becomes infatuated with a young engineer named Anamika (Urmila Matondkar) whounfortunately for himis attached to a trust fund named Rehan. At their second meeting, Nikhil and Rehan scuffle over Anamika, and in the midst of their battle Rahul is shot, resulting in paralysis. Nikhil faces prison for three years, which actually turns out to be the least of his troubles. During those three years Anamika becomes romantically linked with Rahul, who it turns out had a long-standing affair with Ira who was tired of her pathetic husband's emotional and physical torture. Ira helps free Nikhil, whom Steve suspects of having an affair with his wife. Rahul also accuses Anamika of rekindling her \"affair\" with Nikhil. Ira compels Anamika toward Nikhil in her final attempt at escape. Confused? You should be, because (like real life) it's complex and disturbing, and there are no designer outfits or grandiose dance numbers to numb the pain of the tragedy which unfolds around these five lives. Betrayal turns to Obsession, Helplessness to Hopelessness, and Attraction to Rape in this brilliantly constructed and acted film.Though the film's title purports it to be about how one incident transforms the lives of all those involved, its final implications are of much more ubiquitous themes: it is basically a filmed series of unending horrors and disappointments which shows life in its most bitter and grotesque form. There is also a shocking twist at the end which makes the film really work. It is a true \"Greek\" tragedy, which should give you little doubt as to how it ends, but there is more than general catastrophe: there is murder, suicide, betrayal, abuse, deceit, infidelity, jealousy, self-hatred, enmity, violence and whole host of depravities which are too many to be named here. On top of it all, there's a rape which victimizes neither Ira nor Anamika, but one of the male leads. Oh, and the film also takes time to explore the realities of forced oral sex. Suffice is to say, treacly \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" this film ain't.Onir's tactfully written screenplay aside, the real mainstay of the film is its performances turned in by a fine cadre of actors led by the peerless Juhi Chawla. She is simply outstanding in a role which makes one sit up and notice the currents of strength and despair in Ira which Juhi expertly etches in Ira's eyes and movements. This is not a character one expects to find in Juhi Chawla's repertoire: Ira is bold, self-loathing, and desperate for affection, which drives her into an affair with Rahul which is both emotionally and sexually satisfying. And yes, she does something truly shocking at the end. But Ira is also something of a mystery whose acquaintance with happiness proves too short. Anamika, conversely, is easy to read, though her lucidity does not translate to simplicity. Matondkar portrays her as the eternal romantic, albeit a somewhat helpless one who frequently cannot tolerate her own circumstances. Less fiery and more vulnerable than her usual characters, Matondkar plays her flawlessly as a little girl with adult ambitions. Love, Success, and Self-Actualization are her goals, but she becomes ensnared in a bizarre and almost inexplicable love for Nikhil. One expects Nikhil to be the centerpiece of the film, but he turns out to be much more of a cipher than the others. Suri is always at the center of Onir's films, but in this collaboration he gets a more supportive role which he carries effortlessly, by turns suave, angry, and desperate. Jimmy Shergill is the surprise packet of the film: one expects great performances from Juhi Chawla and Urmila Matondkar, but the Shergill proves he can match their talents with a brooding and intense portrayal of Rahul. In many ways, he is the character at the center of the film. Rehaan Engineer is somewhat of a mixed bag- his delivery teeters between odd and satisfactory, the main problem being his menace is somewhat flat and benign. In some scenes, particularly those with Juhi, his performance clashes with the finesse of the others.Unfortunately, films which forgo formula and embrace innovation are too often ignored by the indiscriminate masses who would rather see Shah Rukh Khan in DDLJ Part VII (or whichever configuration we're on now) so don't be surprised by the many reviewers who have no idea how to react to it. It will join the league of thoughtful cinema rendered obscure by the very fact that it makes demands on its audience instead of bowing to commercial pressures. \"Bas Ek Pal\" holds the mirror up to Life and dares to show us that the reflection is sometimes purely shattered.\n",

Maybe the writer potentially can translate it better on screen and set a new benchmark. Sadly the reality speaks a different lingo. Major part of the movie is akin to waiting lounge. Twiddling thumbs. Admist the the eerie camera movement and spooky sound effects you await for the plot to get going. Sadly the snail twitches after a point when the audience has totally lost interest. Very similar to dilly-dallying a candy with a kid and offering it when he doesn't want any more. Owing to the failed engine, the performances of everyone gets awashed. Agreed that RGV believes in taking risks and providing platform to newcomers.

It is the simply comic situations that get created one after the other. Its a hilarious movie but doesn't create big laughters.

            "Rahul Rawail's Betaab is memorable and wholesome entertainment. It is a love story involving a young poor, simple and humorous guy named Sunny and a spoilt, bratty rich girl called Roma. Sunny is a hard-working guy who owns a farm-house in a small rural town with his mother; Roma lives in a big mansion, and when her father buys another expansive estate, which happens to be near Sunny's farm, she eagerly rushes to check their new property. That's how they meet, and that's how begins their hate-turns-to-love romance. Little do they know that they were actually once childhood friends, and their parents maintained a close friendship until Sunny's dad went bankrupt and the families fell apart (a very stupid reason, indeed). The story takes more shape as Roma's father disapproves of their relationship. While the romantic portions are indeed the main highlight in the story, successfully resting on the youthful and refreshing presence of the two leads, the film has this persistent touch of authenticity that makes everything easy to get involved in.Beautifully portrayed and filmed, Betaab is benefitted from breathtaking locations and extraordinary, timeless songs composed by R. D. Burman. Songs like \"Jab Hum Jawan Hoge\", \"Apne Dil Se Badi\" and \"Badal Yun\" are unforgettable. Where acting goes, Sunny Deol and Amrita Singh, both highly appealing, perform convincingly in their debut roles, and Shammi Kapoor and Nirupa Roy provide great support. Deol in particular is outstanding in his natural simplicity and easygoing sophistication. Betaab is a charming love story which has comedy, drama and action, and many sequences in it were enjoyable and quite fun to watch while there were also several touching moments. I might not have liked everything about this film, but I loved it for its engaging simplicity and for capturing so well the calm beauty of the rural parts of India, achieved with appropriate sets and efficiently aided by the many different and lovely animals, including Sunny's livestock and particularly his cute pet dog. This is a heartwarming film and according to me one of the better Hindi love stories of the 1980s.\n",

            "Kartoos was a Mahesh Bhatt vehicle which could've remained on the track if it didn't contain forced elements like comedy. It contains engrossing action sequences, admirable dialogues, and powerpacked scenes but an overdose of songs and comedy has diluted the film's impact. The film also takes a hit because of one major characterization issue. It is definitely devastating because this was Bhatt's last directional venture and it had tremendous potential.Kartoos is the story of Jeet Balraj, a ferocious psychopathic prisoner who is saved from death by Inspector Jay Suryavanshi. Jeet is given a chance to resurrect his life if he agrees to be Jay's Kartoos(Weapon). As Jay's weapon, Jeet has to eradicate some terrorists who are responsible for bomb blasts in India. These culprits are operating outside the country so Jeet has to terminate them overseas. While Jeet is overseas, he falls for a Punjabi girl, Manisha, whose parents are trying to find a suitable man for her. Is Jeet able to complete his mission? If yes then will he really be freed from this violent life? Will he be able to live a normal life with Manisha? On paper, Kartoos sounds like a great idea but the execution is far from commendable. The biggest problem with Kartoos is Jeet Balraj's characterization. In an engaging introduction, we witness a killer Jeet who is not bothered about the life of those surrounding him. He pummels cops, pistols a prisoner brutally in a police station, and stabs a cop's hand with a pen. After Jeet reluctantly agrees to work for Jay, he is a different person. The deranged Jeet is colorful and even dances with Jay as his friend in a club. This transition completely ravages Jeet's character. Another complication is the fact that Jaspal Bhatti's character is used to provide an overdose of comedy and family drama. These family scenes are light moments and they are adequate. However, several such scenes dilute the impact of the film. The film drags and bores because of such buffoonery. On the flipside, the film has several entertaining scenes. These are Jeet slaughtering and terrifying the criminals, Jay pressuring Jeet to pull the trigger, Jeet regretting each murder.Mahesh Bhatt has directed the film ably; he falters because of the screenplay. This is definitely a better film than his catastrophe, Duplicate (1998). However, Kartoos pales terribly in front of his riveting film, Zakhm (1998). The film's music contains some great songs like Wallah Ye Ladki and Doston Ke Darmiyan. However, the rest of it including the much hyped digitally enhanced song is forgettable. The background score is refreshing and it definitely gives you the thriller feel. The visual effects are good considering the time of the film and the action is well choreographed.Sanjay Dutt is provided a weak character but he performs superbly. Dutt has acted such roles countless times but this time, he emotes brilliantly. He has expressed the pain and anguish with a high degree of success. Manisha Koirala looks beautiful and acts adequately. Her chemistry with Dutt is great. Jackie Shroff is brilliant as the cop with shades of grey. He gets the best dialogues and makes the most of them. Gulshan Grover is given minimal screen time despite being the arch villain. He is decent as the terrorist, Jagat Jogiya, who wants to spread mayhem all over India. Jaspal Bhatti irritates with his typical forced comedy. The others provide decent support.Overall, Kartoos is an action thriller which could've been a great success. Unfortunately, the goofy comedy ruins the film's focus and this definitely damaged the film's chances of success. At the end of it's run, the film flopped at the box office.\n",

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Calcutta Mail from beginning to end but will have to agree with other viewers and critics that the songs, although very good, tend to bring the roller coaster ride of a film to a screeching halt. Meybe it was felt that the viewers needed to catch their breath since this is a very intense film that and, outside of the songs, never lets up. All the performances were excellent as was the story although, it is interesting that, as in Bichoo, Rani Mukherjee, plays a girl who looses her apartment and moves in with the hero.The real star is Calcutta and how it is so beautifully photographed throughout the film and the sounds of Calcutta and everything in the film is perfectly realized.\n",

            "At his present age with a vast sea of experience behind him, if Naseeruddin Shah gives his approval to any particular project then it has to be something interesting, out of the box and fresh. Plus if it also has actors such as Kay Kay Menon, Atul Kulkarni, Ravi Kishen, Zakir Hussain and Rajesh Sharma featuring along with him in a film appealingly called CHAALIS CHAURAASI, then the expectations are bound to rise steeply without any exception.But at times, a script which might sound great in the reading sessions does not get perfectly transformed on the screen leading to a big disappointment even with such a talented star-cast. Incidentally CHAALIS CHAURAASI suffers with the same drawback as its script had a great entertaining idea to work upon which sadly falls flat due to its lazy and careless execution. Written around a plot of four friends planning to commit a crime with a stolen Police van, the film had enough sequences which ideally could result in a clear winner. But unfortunately, it all remains an average effort only in the end with nothing exceptional coming out due to the various reasons mentioned below.The first one relates to its title itself which never gets explained till the climax. So the viewer keeps on wondering that What is the significance of the number 4084 right till the end. May be the director planned it that way to add a little surprise element in the script. But the move doesn't work and the secret gets revealed too late to make the desired impact.Secondly after an energetic start, the complete first half of the film has simply nothing as far as plot development is concerned. The whole movie basically talks about a single night incidents which actually all start post interval. In other words, 4084 is one of those rare movies, which can be watched straight after the intermission and still you are not going to miss anything important unless you want to see the few deliberately added Item numbers including HAWA HAWA (an almost 3 decades old track of Hassan Jahangir from Pakistan). And that should clearly give you an idea about its casually handled script, direction and editing. Though post intermission it picks up fast and keeps you fairly engaged with its few well directed sequences. But if only the makers could see the shallowness of its first half, the story would have been different.The third and most important drawback of the film is that despite of having many explosive actors in its kitty, the director Hriday Shetty misses his great opportunity and never utilizes any one of them as per their huge talent. Naseer just remains fine and Kay Kay is not the same as we remember him in his earlier flicks. Atul Kulkarni is good in few of his scenes but both Ravi Kishan and Zakir Hussain are not given much to do in the script. However only Rajesh Sharma shines in his small but powerful role and he is really fast emerging as a dependable actor for the directors.In all CHAALISH CHAURAASI can easily be put in the category of those films which you would not mind watching in the convenience of your home (at DVD) but would surely feel the pinch if seen in the theaters. It is also one of those few films which can easily be converted into an enjoyable watch after some severe editing of less than an hour. So if watched in a smaller version or keeping your DVD remote in your hands, it can fairly be called a fine one-time watch for the viewers.\n",

            "If you are tired of watching the typical Indian movie where a typically handsome and smart guy meets and falls in love with a typically beautiful girl, and are wishing for something more original, then 'Chura Liya Hai Tumne' is a good option. Though it does include some of the 'typical' stuff, the story is not entirely based on the love-life of two love-birds.The plot revolves around a bank robbery, which has caused a stir amongst the secret services. Murders and shooting scenes(always present in such a movie)are there. The songs of the movie are pretty good and the movie is not expectable. Some of the things, which were expected, did not happen. This makes the movie better than most of the Indian stuff being released nowadays, and this difference, I believe will greatly contribute to the betterment of Indian movies. The movie is not perfect and does require polishing but still, it's a good effort by the team and a worthy watch.\n",

            "Based on the famous folk tale from One Thousand and One Nights, this film is a nice co-production between India and USSR and it's a very enjoyable film despite the fact that several of the leading actors in it are quite miscast, starting with Dharmendra in the title role. The story obviously makes up for many of its possible flaws given how good it is to begin with, and the film is well made in terms of execution, setting, and art direction. The script deviates from the original tale quite a bit, but I don't think anyone would mind it, it is its draggy narrative that takes it down. In its favour, once it picks up it gets relatively better, and the film is further enhanced by the wonderful music of R. D. Burman, with the famous \"Khatouba\" in Asha Bhosle's excellent rendition topping them all. Dharmendra despite not being the best choice for the part is quite good, so is Hema Malini, while Zeenat Aman does better as Fatima. The film is overloaded with stereotypical villains but for once it is good because that's what such a fairy tale calls for, and it works. While a little long and requires patience at times, it is still nice, wholesome entertainment.\n",

            "Akshay Kumar had flops each year of the 90s period and the reason was his wrong choice of films. Some of his films were good but didn't get the attention it deserved, Nazar Ke Samne falls in these bracket of films. The film isn't anything great but it is a decent action thriller for it's time. When films like Amaanat, Zaalim, and Hum Hain Bemisaal flopped in 1994, Nazar Ke Samne joined this flop club when it shouldn't have.The story is about some guy called Umesh who gets framed for a murder he didn't commit. The accusations plotted against him are proved wrong and the verdict is in Umesh's favor until a person Ravi Kumar comes and identifies Umesh as the killer. Umesh is sentenced and arrested by the police. Umesh's sister finds out that Ravi was paid to lie in court and she tries to change Ravi. Ravi however shows reluctance but changes. Now it is up to Ravi to find the real killer before Umesh gets hanged. The only thing Ravi has is the picture of the killer's shoes which is far from enough to catch the real killer.The movie is definitely not a perfect thriller but it tries and successfully manages to be a decent thriller for it's time. The movie probably didn't succeed because it was something different from the usual Masala action films. The film does drag in parts and the forced romance between Umesh's sister and Ravi does slow down the tempo of the film but the movie manages to catch up soon. The songs weren't needed and they are the major drawback of the film, the music isn't great and it slows down the film as well. The ending is typical yet fun because the action is mind blowing.Direction by Jagdish A Sharma is good, he handles almost every scene well and the suspense is well built. The only problem is the forced romance which slows the film down and shifts the focus from the actual story. This is one Sharma's best films. Sadly, this and Sapoot are his only good films while films like Judge Mujrim and Devta are crass.Akshay Kumar does a good job and his dynamic change is also well shown. Many people say that Akshay was extremely raw in his earlier days and wasn't much of a good actor. I deny this because these kind of films showed his real acting skills. Yes, he does overact is certain scenes but that is forgiven as he does act well in most parts of the film. Farheen was an unknown heroine of the 90s period and this is one of her good performances. She does good as the troubled sister of the innocent Umesh but her romance with Akshay is stereotypical and boring. The actor playing Umesh does a good job as well, his stress and anger is well shown. Kiran Kumar for once is terrific but Mukesh Khanna like always overacts terribly. The rest provide commendable support that the film desperately needs.On the whole, Nazar Ke Samne is one of those underrated thrillers that was completely unnoticed by the public. I guess the audience didn't like these kind of films and that is why the film flopped. However, the film is watchable and provides fantastic entertainment as an action thriller. I recommend this underrated thriller, it is amazing for the most part.\n",

            "Daraar was the third remake of Sleeping with the enemy and is saved from being the worst only because Yaraana was that bad. Agnisaakshi was the only film that managed to work both in terms of BO as well as critical and audience appreciation.The kings of suspense, Abbas Musataan did try to bring novelty with their treatment. If one has no idea what the film is about, the introduction sequence, which is muted with the background score, manages to generate interest. That probably is the only good thing about the film. From there on, it goes downhill.Casting is another problem. The good actor that he is, Rishi Kapoor was old to play this role. And also he had played the exact same role in Yarana. The exact same role! Rishi Kapoor has also enacted in 2 of the Hindi remakes of the Hollywood flick Coming to America - Prem Rog and Pehla Pehla Pyaar. Juhi Chawla was good. She was even nominated at the Filmfare awards for her portrayal of the battered wife. Incidentally, Madhuri Dixit was also nominated for playing the same role a year earlier in Yarana. It was Manisha Koirala, who featured in the only successful remake of this Hollywood film (Agnisakshi) and wasn't nominated! Now that's irony. Arbaaz Khan made a confident debut and earned his first (and probably only) Filmfare award.Abbas Mustaan's films always had hit music and his association with Anu Malik usually sold well. This time, the combination failed. The music, at best, was below average. None of the songs are worth remembering, even though a couple are rip offs of Pakistani Hits (something Anu Malik is famous for).The direction was alright, but given bad casting, everything seemed unbearable as the film went on and on. And the climax was absolutely criminal. I expected so much more from Abbas Mustaan. The badshaahs of suspense cinema had delivered a big dud.\n",

Okay, so saif's hairline recedes in some of the songs (oviously filmed at a later date) and his, Sanjay's, Bipasha's and Kim's looks do keep changing. The songs are not memorable and the plot is just plain weird.However, Saif gives the kind of cheeky-but-charming performance he is well known for and Sanjay impressed me in a comedy role. Bipasha looks young and beautiful.It involves two opposite-personality kind of thieves who get jobs at Bips' hotel in order to steal some money. Once there a lot of jokes (and of course, romance) ensue. Personally i find it really picks up when they jet off to Mauritius and find the guy they are trying to take money from is dead. From there on in they need to pretend he is alive and so walk with him, dance with him etc to make it seem so. This basically covers the second half of the movie. You might say that such a joke is in bad taste (and perhaps so) but by the time the dead body is being revived by some local mauritius pop song and boogying its way to where the money is hidden, you won't care. Seriously hilarious.I fully believe that with a few tweaks to the script, some more money, better songs etc this film could have been a hit!\n",

Her family, of course, wants her to marry a nice Indian boy and carry on the family traditions, but she meets and falls instantly in love with Jay, a nice boy that is definitely NOT Indian. The songs (of which there are many) are delivered in the Bollywood style of breaking into song at any moment (even more so than in American Musicals).

The acting done by Govinda, Urmila Matondkar, and Paresh Rawal is excellently balanced between comedic and realistic, and doesn't seem overdone. Govinda is a hoot throughout and Urmila proves once again that she is not just a pretty face and a bombshell, but has great acting potential and has made a place for herself in the Indian film industry. The music is melodious and accentuates the emotions of the film. The side love stories between the dogs and the servants from both Govinda and Urmila's homes are just too cute and funny.

While they were arguing, Ajit shoots both of them from the window, and frames them for murdering each other. Meanwhile he kills Ram's mother Saraswati who also raises her brother in-law's son Balram as her own (supposedly, but she pops up at the end somehow). Jagatpal forcefully raises Ram to be a thief, and Balram to be educated without the accompaniment of his brother/cousin. He does this with sharp-pointy objects on the ends of his crutches...if they don't listen he threatens to stab them.Ram (Dharmendra) ends up being a car mechanic, and Balram (Amitabh Bachchan) ends up being a police officer. Jagatpal shares his plan, for Ram to be the best smuggler, and for Balram to be the best police officer. Balram tries to argue, but those annoying pointy things are once again a threat.The first half of the movie (excluding the evilness of their evil uncle) was pretty entertaining ~ Dharmendra and Amitabh are first shown together and then shown in different scenes separately to show the differences and similarities in their life. Balram falls in love with Shoba (Rekha - a good couple I must say) and Ram falls in love with Madhu (Zeenat - she is very ugly in this movie and her a Dharam don't match). The part where they display their own girls to each other is pretty funny.But I mean the VIOLENCE is just TOOOO much! I watch action movies, but this was ridiculous! After the first half, one who is watching this movie won't even be able to see the nice acting of the Dharmendra and Amitabh! It's like shooting and blowing up things all the time. And Jagatpal's evilness gets to be too much. It's hard to believe that it was so hard for toughies like Dharmendra and Amitabh to beat up a cripple.I only rate it a nine because I am an ardent fan of Dharmendra as well as Amitabh and I wasn't particularly disappointed with their powerful performance combo. I recommend this movie if you like the actors, and if you're a fan of Laxmikant Pyarelal who made good songs (like Ek Rasta, Hama Maafi Dai Do, Yaar Ki Khabar, and Ladki Pasand). But if you're not then don't waste your time. I was thoroughly angry with Vijay Anand's violent and perverted direction.Stick with Sholay.\n",

            "This movie was very contemporary in its theme at the time of its production. People might not identify with it now, but it is a very good representation of the middle class society of the Eighties. Resources were scarce, ambitions were big and everyone in the family needed to adjust to the conditions often giving up on their dreams. I think this movie is a must watch for today's generation who have grown up after the economic reforms. It gives a very accurate and detailed picture of our past and is a cue to understanding the generation before us. The performances are Top notch. Utpal Dutt has portrayed the helplessness and hurt with a dignity that only he could manage. Rakhi has again given one of those performances in which silence and actions speaks louder than words. This was one of Anil Kapoor's earlier movies and he was still not a star. But his potential was well noticed in this movie. Script and editing are also good although I can understand that things have been a bit over-dramatized and there are a few unwanted song sequences. But again 80s were not really good times for the Indian cinema. And for once the movie was about a real Indian family. Not the Super rich, cash abundant, Ferrari driving, Personal jet owner NRIs who have so much money that the only thing they can think about is love and marriage. This was real cinema not a dreamland. So on a scale adjusted for trends in different times, I would still give it an 8.\n",

Certainly, an overlooked film!'Kaun Kitne Paani Mein' wryly expresses the changes in hierarchy, caste and the power equation when water, the most important resource, vanishes and how the oppressed become the oppressors. The story is told through two villages which were split based on caste and money but never through water. In the current situation, through reversals of fortune, the old world order has been broken and water becomes the biggest game changer. It has a domino effect on everything from social order to economics, even love and marriage. The film takes a satirical look at respect for resources, caste divides, and rural life against the backdrop of a traditional love story but all set in a realm where water is the new currency.'Kaun Kitne Paani Mein' is strongly structured. I was connected by the eccentric characters, be it the penniless raja, his henpecked son or the aspiring politician along-with his superbly sly daughter. Nila Madhab Panda's Direction is simple, but effectively done. The Writing is crisp, although the concluding moments are a bit underwhelming.Performance-Wise: Kunal Kapoor, Radhika Apte, Saurabh Shukla & Gulshan Grover are up for vie top honors. Kapoor, a highly underrated actor, pitches in a natural performance, enacting a very non-heroic role with believability. Apte is a marvel. Not only is she gorgeous, but an actress to reckon with. She's flat-out-fabulous! Shukla & Grover are seasoned players & hence, they don't fail to mesmerize.

It may be because their style started looking dated to the wide audience, who by then started getting used to the mindless action movies of those years. Rang Birangi is one of Mukherjee's lesser known films, and admittedly, it is not as good as his previous comedy pictures. Having said that, it's still a very colourful and enjoyable comedy of errors which deals with marriage. The film starts very well, though towards the end the level of interest is reduced due to the rather messy proceedings. The film stars several good actors, including Amol Palekar, Parveen Babi, Deepti Naval, Farooq Shaikh, and Utpal Dutt. The one who actually shines the most is Naval, who is very natural and lovely. Parveen Babi also does the best of a character that could have looked rather bland in the hands of a less spontaneous actress. Palekar is always good at comedy, and here too he is good although at moments he loses himself. So is Shaikh. Deven Verma and Utpal Dutt are gifted comic actors who can always be counted on to bring a few laughs. Rang Birangi is benefited by a good story which is effectively told. As most Mukherjee movies, it is filled with simplicity, and the film does not take itself too seriously. Overall not among Mukherjee's best but still a fun movie which is worth the watch.\n",

Nevertheless I liked it, especially because of the great performance of Rani Mukherjee. She plays her role absolutely convincingly.

            "'Rudaali' tells the haunting tale of Shanichari, a woman who has suffered a lot from being treated like an outcast by the villagers to abandoned parents, lack of financial security, and so much more. Now at this old age, when she barely makes a living, her friend Bhekni, asks her to work with her as a 'rudaali' (hired mourner). But Shanichari has been too hardened by life that her eyes never even leak a small drop of tear. All this is changed by a revelation.This is perhaps one movie where director Kalpana Lajmi gets it all (or most of it) right. Her other films that I have seen 'Daman' and 'Chingaari' approach unrealistic solutions to the themes that are tackled and tend to end dramatically. 'Rudaali' too ends on a dramatic note but it feels more real and fit to the theme. I loved the way the film opens with the silhouettes of four dancing 'rudaalis' and ends with a muted cry. Throughout the film, the pace is well-maintained and the platonic love between Shanichari and the young 'zameendar' and between Shanichari and Bhekni is very well portrayed. 'Rudaali' is also part satirical as we see how the mourners are also seen as a form of entertainment. The great Gulzar deserves equal credit for his screenplay as 'Rudaali' would never have turned up this way had it not been for this man's input.The songs are beautiful and breathtaking. The great Gulzar's lyrics are simply amazingly awesome and it's quite apparent how the singers, including Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangshkar and Bhupen Hazarika have put their heart into the singing. My favourite song of the soundtrack is 'Dheere Chalo' which is introduced in the opening sequence and repeated in the film. the songs will haunt the viewer long after the end credits have rolled.Just like the singers, the actors too have put their heart into their acting. A frighteningly obese Amjad Khan perfectly fits his part. Raj Babbar is impressive. Raghuvir Yadav, Sushmita Mukherjee and Mita Vashist are effective in their small roles. Rakhee is excellent. It's refreshing to see her after a long time in a role other than the typical Hindi film mom she was famous for playing. However, 'Rudaali' belongs to a barely recognizable Dimple Kapadia. She looks authentic as Shanichari and acts very natural. I've never liked her as an actress based on her 80s and early 90s films but she impressed me in 'Krantiveer' and 'Dil Chahta Hai' and in 'Rudaali' she proves that she can be an amazing actress and that she can act her heart out given the right role. A phenomenal performance. One of the finest of the 90s.'Rudaali' is quite a beautiful film to watch. The cinematography and background score are simply wonderful. Lajmi's attempt is honest and she tells the sad tale very convincingly. 'Rudaali' may not appeal to all (especially those looking for sugarcoated entertainment) but to me this is a genuine piece of cinema, a film where all the parts (story, music, acting, cinematography...) fit together brilliantly.\n",

            "What's bound to be far more interesting than the dreadful Buttons is an article about the making of this movie: Why are Kate Winslet and Robert Redford BOTH narrating? Who snookered the venerable Angela Lansbury and Dick Van Dyke into appearing in such a ramshackle production? How are there no credited writers or producers for this film? How did a movie with such an impressive cast manage to play for one night in US theaters before disappearing to DVD and cable? Why is this film so consistently cheap-looking? Who decided to make this a musical when the songs are consistently rotten? And why does director Tim Janis give himself name-above-the-title placement on both the opening and closing credits? (Is the official title supposed to be TIM JANIS BUTTONS?)Sheer catastrophe, and not of the so-bad-it's good variety. Don't subject yourself or your unwitting families to this disasterpiece.

            "Manish Tiwary Adapts Shakespeare's Ever-Appealing Romeo & Juliet, with his latest directorial film 'Issaq'. Fortunately, despite its flaws, this Love-Story appeals in parts. The madness as well as the violence in the narrative, leave a mark.'Issaq' Synopsis: A contemporary adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set in the backdrop of Varanasi in the UP heartland, complete with naxalism, sand mining mafia and of course the timeless love story.'Issaq' isn't impressive entirely, but some parts of the film, are genuinely interesting. Note the portions when our desi Romeo & Juliet meet & fall in love, or even the violent scenes, where the warring families go head to head with each-other. These portions stand out!But, there are flaws. The Writing isn't solid, it does engage, but it lacks sharpness in the second-hour, specifically. Also, the excessive running time over a 140-minutes, acts as a deterrent. Tiwary's Screenplay needed a tougher attitude, but he induces craziness in the Love-Story, which appealed to me. His Direction, on the other-hand, is satisfactory. Cinematography captures the rustic mood of the film well. Editing needed to be crispier. Music by Various Artists, is excellent. Performance-Wise: Prateik delivers earnestly, but he can work on his expressions & styling. Debutant Amyra Dastur is extremely photogenic & confident. Given the right roles, she can go places. Ravi Kishan, Sudhir Pandey, Amit Sial & Makarand Deshpande are marvelous in supporting roles. Rajeshwari Sachdev enacts the Grey shaded character with brilliance. On the whole, 'Issaq' holds some appeal.\n",

            "Disregarding its originality (or lack thereof), I really wanted to watch it mainly because of the cast, which includes talents like Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma, among others. For me, this movie was an extremely enjoyable thriller. The film was benefited from its taut execution and the proceedings followed a fast pace. Atypically, the movie is devoid of songs and too many emotions, and it is towards the second half when an unexpected story twist turns the film into a conventionally emotional drama of sorts. From then on it was a bit predictable but then again the movie as a whole keeps you at the edge of your seat. It is aided by the good casting, and every actors plays his part very well. Irrfan Khan is fantastic as the evil kidnapper and he is even better towards the end in the flashback scenes. Konkona is very fine and convincingly plays the worried mom in a role that would have been a weepy caricature in the hands of a lesser actress. Sandhya Mridul is outstanding, while Rajit Kapoor and Zakir Hussain play their respective parts exceedingly well. The film's ending is rather sugarcoated and well, it just grew increasingly melodramatic towards the end so no surprises there. Though unoriginal and far from being perfect, Deadline: Sirf 24 Ghante is good entertainment.\n",

Salman Khan uttering dialogues with extreme attitude & high-octane bravado, Katrina Kaif glittering the screen with her diamond-white skin, Shah Rukh Khan stretching his hands out to call her reel-love... gravity defying action, brain-defying comedy and cloth-defying dance numbers! Why do we go for a movie? To get a lesson on honesty, sincerity and the crafts of being a good person? No... of course not! Then movies like Shool, Ghaath, Kurukshetra, Munnabhai MBBS would have made honest men out of us.We just like spending 3 hours watching something that doesn't put much pressure to our unused parts in the brain.Frankly, I like watching all the types of movies mentioned above. But, that doesn't stop me from taking chance with a movie, that actually has a soul... and that doesn't stop me from liking movies that doesn't meet the above mentioned criteria.This is the case with Love U... Mr Kalakaar! The day Tusshar Kapoor was signed in for the lead role, the movie's fate had a bold lettered FLOP written in it. Because, audience wants Tusshar Kapoor to only play a paranoid mute clown again and again.Well, who else would have done this role anyway? A movie about a genuinely good person, spreading his goodness like a virus - who likes that? Good is so overrated! People want their heroes to be bad! You will say - hey, we liked 3 idiots! Yes, of course, we are incapable of liking something until it's larger than life. Life isn't a colorful canvas - life is dull, monotonous, painful, tragic - for an average Joe, life is non-happening, uneventful, where he goes to a 9-12 job 5 days a week, sits on the same desk, does the same work and spends the weekend thinking maybe the next week would bring something interesting - but it doesn't.Love U... Mr Kalakaar is honest, straightforward film that never goes loud or overboard with its story or the acting. It doesn't do anything insane or shocking, it doesn't thrill you to bite your nails - it just looks at you into your eyes and tells - I may not be a very happening part of your life, I may not be as shiny as your exterior, I may not be stylish like your gel-dipped hair, I may not be able to flex like your biceps, I may not be able to impress people like your street-smart tongue... but eventually you will have to consider me, because I am the most important part of your existence - I am your soul.Anyway, my review is as follows - an honest & decent love story, that isn't just a mushy mushy tale of never-ending love. It's a story that every member of a family can like, if they give it a shot. I haven't seen Tusshar so controlled, since Khakee. Amrita is perfect as a bubbly, beautiful, smart & self-confident girl. Ram Kapoor adds a lot of glamour and weight to the movie with his opinionated father persona. And it's lovely to see Madhu after so many years, in such a weight-ful role. Among other actors, Prem Chopra & Yateen Karyekar stand out.The story is predictable, but the journey is still worth experiencing. If you still have the heart in the right place, give this movie a try - because it does.\n",

However, as movie progressed Sanjay has really made it worth the watch (both time and money!). Recently there has been a string on nonsense movies coming. So I was impressed. However the plot is bit radical especially a made for Indian audience ending. However, I don't think this is anyone else but Sanjay's movie! I just hope the choice of actors were better. Amisha is not suited for the role at all. I think Antra would have done better. Amisha was not able to bring or compliment the emotions needed. Even her make up was not suited for the role. She is pretty dumb to adapt to roles. I saw her teesri aankh. Even there she was lame. For her role she should have made an attempt to learn the sign language. So in this respect this was a half hearted attempt by the director and producer. I don't think failure of movie can be blamed at Sanjay. At best he is the only asset to the movie.\n",

            "Ghulami was the maiden venture of now well-known filmmaker, J.P. Dutta. It's a thought-provoking movie, baring the bitter truth of the slavery of the downtrodden Indian poor peasant to the heartless Indian caste system as well as poverty. The poor peasant (mainly belonging to a lower caste in the discriminatory caste system) takes birth in a loan which had been taken by his ancestors and dies in loan, leaving it for his next generation; his land and belongings are always under the threat of confiscation due to non-payment of the loan and worstly the honour of the ladies of his family is under constant threat from the lusty landlords, still enjoying the undesirable benefits of the feudalistic landownership system continuing for centuries in the rural India. On 15th August, 1947, our country got independence but the poor peasants are still accurst to bear the brunt of the slavery of the mighty.Ghulami (1985) was the maiden directorial venture of J.P. Dutta whose story was written by his father, O.P. Dutta. He has presented the story of a well-educated and but full of self-respect peasant (Dharmendra) who unfortunately finds himself on the lower rung of the ladder of the social structure because of his birth. The daughter of the supercilious landlord, though, possesses a different nature and outlook and she (Smita Patil) is a close friend of him. The police of the village, as usual, is sold in the hands of the landlord (Om Shivpuri) and join hands with him and his arrogant and lustful sons (Bharat Kapoor and Mazhar Khan) to oppress and humiliate the already victimized by misusing the power of the uniform. A like-minded ex-serviceman (Mithun Chakraborty) join hands with him and a lower-caste kind-hearted Hawaldar (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) also comes to his side after losing his son in an confrontation with the upper caste and rich mighties who don't allow the lower caste grooms to ride a horse. The main protagonist has to become a bandit in the eyes of the law to save the land and the honour of the hundreds of peasants, leaving his pregnant wife (Reena Roy) behind. The husband of his friend (the landlord's daughter) is a senior police officer (Nasiruddin Shah) who also becomes his enemy on personal level after knowing about his friendship with his wife. The violence-ridden climax underscores this harsh reality only that the rebels die, the cruel and unjust system doesn't.I am a Rajasthani, well-acquainted with the deserts there and therefore I acknowledge with high appreciation, the skill of J.P. Dutta in capturing the area in with finesse. The complete background and the milieu is highly realistic and impressive - the sand dunes, the Hawelis, the village lanes, the tattered houses of the poor and even the Police Chowki. The narrative is in complete synchronization with the milieu nowhere the movie renders an air of being an imaginary story. Almost everything looks real. The narrative is spellbinding. Right from the very first frame to the very last frame, the movie is able to keep the viewer tied to his seat with his eyes glued to the screen. The screenplay swiftly moves from scene to scene and J.P. Dutta has demonstrated his better sense by keeping the movie completely free from meaningless comedy and unrealistic romance. The love-angles are touching, not titillating.The music of Laxmikant Pyarelal the meaningful songs (only three) having been penned by Gulzar. The best one is definitely Jeehaal-e-Muskin Mukon Ba-Ranjish Bahaal-e-Hijra Bechaara Dil Hai (picturized on Mithun and his love-interest Anita Raj). Mere Pee Ko Pawan is an underrated excellent song. The third one is Pee Le Pee Le which is also good to listen and better to watch.The impressive, meaningful and touching dialogues are another highlight of this movie. The production value is quite high and the cinematographer has marvelled in not only capturing the beauty of rural Rajasthan but also creating impact through the shadows in certain scenes.J.P. Dutta possess the knack to extract the best from his caste. All the main characters - Dharmendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Nasiruddin Shah, Kulbhushan Kharbanda etc. have delivered their best. Leading ladies- Smita Patil, Reena Roy and Anita Raj also have done pretty well in their low-profile roles in this male-dominated movies. Supporting caste (Sulochana, Om Shivpuri, Bharat Kapoor, Mazhar Khan, Raza Murad etc.) has also done justice to the respective roles assigned. Except the over-the-top Anjan Shrvastav (the accountant of the landlord), all look flesh and blood human-beings.Ghulami is an outstanding movie which was a box-office hit also. To understand the caste-ridden class-conflicts and related dynamics in India, this movie can be used just like a textbook.\n",

            "While 'Bombay To Bangkok' may not rank among Kukunoor's best films, it is a very entertaining, adventurous and sweet flick. Hearing all the negative comments, I was still hoping that the film wouldn't be as bad. It wasn't bad. Yes there are flaws. I found the pacing to be slow and I thought Kukunoor could have added some more spice by building more humour. Some have complained that there wasn't enough of the beauty of Thailand in the film. While that may have made the film more pleasant to look at, it's still a film not a travel documentary. So I don't hold this as a major flaw and we still get to see some sights and sound of the country.In a few scenes, Kukunoor parodies his other film 'Iqbal'. He includes the cast: Shreyas Talpade, Yatin Karyekar and the great Naseeruddin Shah. There's part of the 'Aashayein' song which is hilariously used. There are plenty of such laughing moments. The love story between the doctor and the gangster rapper is hilariously endearing.The songs are quite funny too. 'Sama Same but Different' is quite catchy while most of the other songs (there aren't as many) are included in the background.Debutante Lina Christianson adds an exotic freshness to the cast. She has a lovely smile, good screen presence and shares a wonderful chemistry with Talpade. Shreyas Talpade totally owns up to the character. The actor is showing more of his versatility and becoming one of the finest actors of the current generation. Vijay Maurya is laugh out loud as the gangster rapper. One just has to watch it to see what I mean. Naseeruddin Shah is only there in one scene but he further adds to the comic relief.I also liked how Kukunoor, in a subtle way brought forth taboo issues such as prostitution. There's a splendid scene where Shankar tries to convince Jasmine to leave her job and Jasmine cleverly answers to him that it's just a regular job for which she works hard. One has to listen to the dialogue to understand the full essence of the scene.I would like to add that one shouldn't expect anything from 'Bombay to Bangkok' other than a fun comedy. It's certainly not as bad as critics have labelled it to be. It may not be as great as Kukunoor's 'Dor', 'Iqbal' and 'Teen Deewarein' but it is one that can be easily enjoyed with friends.\n",

            "Corruption, injustice, politics, vengeance and love, these are some of the issues Gulzar's 'Hu Tu Tu' deals with. The story is told through flashbacks as reminisced by Panna, a young woman who has been kidnapped in response to the imprisonment of one of the kidnapping gang's members. Panna, the daughter of the chief minister of Maharashtra Malti Barve, finds herself recalling her childhood days with her domineering mother and spineless father. The flashbacks follow Malti's rise from a school teacher to her current occupation as a powerful politician. We see how Panna grows to be a rebellious and carefree young woman who despises her mother. In between the story presents Panna's relationship with none other than the man who kidnapped her, Aditya Patel, who, like herself, had lived his life under the shadow of his father, a wealthy and corrupted industrialist named P N Patel. The flashbacks carry some romantic scenes and show how Adi and Panna find solace in each other.Gulzar's storytelling never failed to impress and this time we are presented with a well-made piece which is moving albeit less involving. Gulzar's direction is excellent and he gives every character a story of its own. While the film is quite authentic in terms of script, acting and sets, the narrative style is actually very mainstream, which is not a bad thing, but the attempt to commercialise the product as much as possible brings to a certain lack of focus. The film includes many songs (all of which were penned by Gulzar himself of course). The music was composed by the then-fresh talent Vishal Bhardwaj, and though the songs were quite melodious, not always did they feel necessary and at times they dragged the narrative quite a bit, which is a pity especially considering that the pace was quite slow. Some scenes are quite emotional, not in a melodramatic way though, and there were numerous heartbreaking scenes which would shock the viewer. The dialogues are effective and poetic, especially those mouthed by Nana Patekar, which is quite the right thing to do given his role is that of a street poet. Where acting goes, everyone is first-rate, from leading actors to those who have tiny supporting roles. Needless to say, this is Tabu's movie and this actress is simply outstanding as the smart and honest Panna, as always infusing her character with depth and maturity. Her cut hair style really suits her and along with her tomboyish attitude contributes to the building of a persona that is as charming as it is righteous. Sunil Shetty gets a role of substance for once, and he does it very well. I was actually surprised to see him in a Gulzar movie and frankly I would have preferred to see someone like Akshay Kumar in the role, but he does a good job nonetheless. Nana Patekar is as great as always as the idealistic and kind-hearted Bhau. And finally, Suhasini Mulay, who plays the tough politician. This character is actually very similar to Suchitra Sen's Aarti from Gulzar's 1975 classic Aandhi. In my view Mulay was nowhere as good as Sen was in Aandhi, but she still was an excellent choice for the role and she did it well.Hu Tu Tu is definitely a fine movie - interesting, intense and impressively made. The ending was quite unexpected and unsettling but it was a very effective twist which brought out an important message to the audience. My biggest regret is that, while the portrayal of romance, family and relationships was very well handled on its own, it was at times overtaken by the political side of the movie, which brings me to a personal conclusion that the movie is good, but not as good as, say, Mani Ratnam's Dil Se, or Gulzar's own Aandhi. Anyway, I recommend you to watch Gulzar's last directorial venture, mainly for the performances and also for the message, which is conveyed well and is free for individual interpretation.\n",

            "I always thought \"Mr & Mrs '55\" was a terrible title and surely there were better possibilities  it makes it sound pretty ordinary. Whereas it was a nice little romantic musical comedy and better than most of its contemporaries with some memorable upbeat music from O.P.Nayaar.Anita, played by the gorgeous Madhubala, is forced to marry Preetam played by dashing Guru Dutt purely on her aunts orders but falls in love with him - much to her aunts disgust and opposition. It's engrossing enough a story but the jaunty yet earnest songs sung by Rafi and Geeta Dutt are the thing, especially Thandi Hawa (my all-time favourite Madhubala moment at the lido), Johnny Walker's infuriatingly catchy Jaane Kahan Mera, and the Rafi/Dutt duet Chal Diya Banda Nawaaz - beautifully sung beautiful lyrics always make me wish it had gone on another 10 minutes. Favourite bit; the amazingly heartrending scene where Anita realises how much in love she is, just before Udhar Tum. As a counterpoint to the overall optimism of this film it's sad to remember 9 years afterwards Dutt committed suicide at 39 and in 1969 Madhubala died of heart disease at only 36.Overall, great stuff, wish I had a cleaner copy, and don't let the title put you off.\n",

            "I don't know of many films that explore behind the scenes of the prolific Indian film industry, but I love the view into a new world offered by this one. In general, I like the films of Merchant-Ivory- they are almost always beautiful, well-crafted, well-acted and excellent at handling delicate subject matter, subtle emotions, and stories of character growth and psychology. I think BOMBAY TALKIE is one of the best, on par with the later triumphs of A ROOM WITH A VIEW, HOWARD'S END and REMAINS OF THE DAY. Visually, the movie has that stunning, crisp, breath-taking combination of color, light and space that made every frame of A ROOM WITH A VIEW so wonderful to watch- and the beauty of the film's (BOMBAY TALKIE)visuals are especially nice considering it was made in 1970. The use of music, singing and dance also bring an interesting quirkiness to the film, and help present the world of the characters- all of whom are interesting, especially the hero, his wife Marla (who gives a stunning performance), and his ex-girlfriend (the scene between her and the hero, once Lucia has left him to follow a guru, is one of the most beautifully executed late night conversation scenes I've ever seen, and gives so much insight into a relatively insignificant character's life and relationships- on par with the drinking scene in Hal Hartley's SIMPLE MEN). Most fantastic about this film was the screenplay- one of Ruth Prawer Jbvala's better ones, well-directed (as usual) by James Ivory. It is poetic, when it needs to be, sinister when the moment calls for it, and it ties nicely into the ending with excellent stops along the way to comment on Hollywood film making, sham-spiritualism quests by Westerners in India, the loneliness of art, the stupidity of petty, fear-controlled people, and the destructive quality of unhealthy obsession. A fine, enjoyable film, not at all dated, not for everyone by any means, but worth looking into if you're interested in seeing something different.\n",

            "At the surface, Parakash Jha's Mrityu Dand is a feminist tale, and it actually is to a high extent, but there's much more to it than just that. Mrityu Dand is a rather uplifting story about the power of self belief and togetherness, and it shows how far one can go by summoning up the courage and demanding their right to be respected. The movie addresses woman empowerment, and yes, it would certainly inspire women to stand for their rights. However, I believe it has a much broader message and it would equally inspire any person of either sex to fight for dignity and independence, even when facing the cruelest, strongest and most evil of opponents. In that respect this movie is universally relevant for everyone, irrespective of their gender, colour or class.Jha's script and direction are very good and he captures the raw atmosphere of the village, which is quite disturbing at times. As she often does, here too Madhuri Dixit accepts a strong female character, reminiscent in parts of her famous characters in movies like Beta and Anjaam. She enters as a young bride into a conservative family in a small village with a cultural and social world which is very distinct from hers and in which both men and women see domestic violence as a common norm of family life. Yet she herself refuses to accept such behaviour and is ready to fight against it. The village itself is dominated by a cruel landowner, and this bureaucracy is also something she is willing to condemn.Madhuri Dixit is excellent as the smart, fearless and decisive Phoolva. This really is a role this actress does best, and she yet again creates a charming screen lady with conviction. This is also the kind of role that explains why she is so admired by women and aspiring actresses. Shabana Azmi once called her role in this film, that of an abandoned wife who sets on a relationship with another man, as one of her best of that period in the 1990s, and her story in the film is indeed very interesting. Azmi is unsurprisingly amazing and plays her role with great depth, making the transformation from a subservient woman to someone who finally makes a place in the sun exceedingly well. Shilpa Shirodkar is fantastic in her small role. Ayub Khan is fine, while Om Puri turns in another impressive performance.Mrityu Dand is not a particularly flawless film. It could have been better had the execution been better handled like casting better actors for the very minor supporting roles (some of them really overacted) and taking out some annoyingly irrelevant little sub-plots and some melodramatic sequences which didn't really make sense. I also felt at points it went a bit too far in its attempt to make its feminist point, which is a pity because it was very well conveyed even without being overly emphasised. The ending was also sadly exaggerated in this regard. It could have been much simpler, given most of the film was not dramatically unrestrained.Having said that, this is as already said an inspiring film which is also quite entertaining and generally very well made, and the performances are thoroughly good by the leading actors. It works much more as a film celebrating social empowerment, and that's where it is most powerful and riveting. I'm sure not many would enjoy watching a film which depicts a world of cruelty, corruption and rural bureaucracy, but it still is a good social film which strikes an interesting balance between art-house cinema and mainstream film standards, and is well worth watching.\n",

            "Father-Daughter Bhatt have embarked on a mission to ensure Film-Noir is a set genre for Bollywood audience. Jism, Murder and a few other movies of theirs are adaptations of Hollywood movies from years ago. ROG is one of the better movies they have produced, and most of it's credit goes to a brilliant performance by Irfan Khan. I am not exaggerating when I say he is the worthy successor to Naseeruddin Shah in the ease with which he slips into any role he portrays. This movie follows the murder investigation of a beautiful model, Maya Solomon, by 'super-cop' Inspector Uday Rathore (Khan) who suffers from mild-insomnia. While conducting the investigation and piecing together the past of the model, the cop starts falling in love with the image of the dead woman; all the while trying to find her killer. With a cast of a few extras (including a loud 'accented' confused-desi), none of the other performances are worth note. Yet, the movie itself is well made (a proper script, whoa!) with a beautiful score (M.M Kreem) and a brilliant lead performance. The twists (save one) are a little predictable, but the presentation is a revelation for a low-budget Indian movie. Kudos to the director Himanshu Brahmbhatt for a job well done (he is Mahesh Bhatt's AD from the Gumrah & Sadak). If nothing, the movie is worth for the Irfan Khan alone. I have set myself up to watch any movie this man stars in. Oh, and the music is awesome.My Rating ---> 2.5 of 5 Trivia: * Irfan Khan is the same titular 'The Warrior' from Asif Kapadia's epic English movie (which I thought was very slow). * M M Kreem insists on proper poets to pen lyrics for his songs, else he doesn't compose music. (Never expect a 'David Dhawan' song from him). * This movie is a remake of Laura (1944)\n",

So I decided to go Damadamm Too.And what to say, First time i thought HR has done a sincere effort in acting.Almost all things are there for a good entertainer.The cast is good ,Purbi Joshi,Sonal Sehgal and other supporting actors.Himesh has improved his acting skills a lot,there is no doubt but still more improvement is required.he has done almost all scenes with good efforts.Sonal Sehgal had looked gorgeous in the movie and she is plus point but the show stopper was Purbi Joshi.she is Damned talented and done her part very good.The music of Damdamm is very good no doubts better than RaOne in terms of creativity and melody.the songs were in good situations.The Naration was good, Cinematography was good.All the three looked good in movie.Dialogues are good.Himesh has done good job with dialogs.Swapna Waghmare has done good direction in debut film.Some flaws are also there in terms of acting and handling of scenes otherwise it is a treat.The romantic and comedy scenes are good.Its really a feel good film.Simple and Clean Family movie as suggested by Himesh.I request people to watch it once before any criticism and comments.\n",

            "Not very often we get to see a film which has something immensely important to convey through its thoughtful story idea but doesn't get the ample support from its executors to bring forward the exact message of its plot in the desired manner. And whenever such a film is there, it in fact becomes the duty of the reviewers to take an initiative and make that precious message reach its right audience through their individual articles on the film ignoring its other visible glitches.So writing with the same motive, RANGREZZ is surely one of the above mentioned films which can easily be included in the better (if not best) works of the veteran director Priyadarshan, coming back after a string of many forgettable ventures in the recent years. It may not be a perfect film, if looked upon with a cinematic angle. But still it has a bold, relevant theme with some brilliantly conceived scenes by the director & his team, which force you to contemplate upon Friendship, Love & Sex, the three important aspects of every youth's happening life unarguably.Admittedly, the film starts off without making any kind of impact in its initial 20 minutes with the same typical scenes introducing its various characters along with 2 forced-in songs, as usual. But once the abduction angle comes into the script, the narration picks up fast giving you one of the finest & shocking chase sequences (in a crowded temple and market) before the interval, supported by an energetic song running in the background, wherein Sukhwinder is chanting, \"Shambhu Shiv Shambhu\" in a fast tempo and full spirits.The energy generated by this well shot 15 minutes of the film, somehow gets merged into the various subplots coming in post intermission. But it all gets back on the track soon once its major unexpected & thought provoking twist is revealed in the final 40 minutes of the film forcing you to forget its lackluster start and avoidable songs right away. And this is what moved me the most in RANGREZZ depicting a very important issue of Love Marriage and its sustaining power among the youth, living quite dangerously in the present net-age majorly lead by all monetary interests.The film strongly throws in the missing emotional connect in these stunning concluding moments and you just keep watching the proceeding on the screen with some mixed emotions of disgust and anger with your head down. The fiery tragedy in this so called love saga puts you on a thinking mode and its main theme certainly needs to be discussed by the youngsters quite boldly & urgently in their individual groups. Without revealing the surprise element of the film, I would like to add that RANGREZZ redefines friendship in an applaudable manner with Jackky Bhagnani, Amitosh Nagpal, Vijay Verma, Rajpal Yadav & few others in the supporting cast, playing their well written characters very impressively. Though I wished to see more of Priya Anand after her lovable act in English VINGLISH, yet she does full justice to her small role as required. Pankaj Tripathi and Lushin Dubtey add a lot through their impactful portrayal of two cunning politicians and so does Santosh Sivan conveying silently with his camera behind the screen.To be precise, RANGREZZ is not a film revolving around a routine blessed hero & his heroine, but its a collective effort putting forward a shocking, sensible plot which deserves to be seen by the youngsters in particular. Both Vashu Bhagnani and Priyadarshan deserve all the praises to bring in this thoughtful project for the Hindi viewers who normally are not served with such realistic or introspective kind of stuff more often. Musically it has 2 upbeat tracks \"Shambhu Shiv Shambhu\" & \"Govinda Aala Re\" along with the world famous \"Gangnam Style\" being played in the end credits. Yet I felt a few songs in the beginning were not required actually and its background score could have been more concerning, to give you the touch of all that agony felt by its innocent characters on the screen.However being a remake of the Tamil Hit NAADODIGAL (2009), the film clearly reveals another valuable fact that the Regional Cinema in India is much ahead in terms of story ideas and experimentation than the more famous & loved Bollywood. In other words, Hindi film industry still has to go a long way to come up with such original films of its own, moving ahead of its huge dependency on \"The Remakes\".So where many reviewers might have given a very low rating to the film discarding it completely, there I would like to recommend RANGREZZ to every true friend and couples in deep love, thinking or already experienced Love Marriage in their real life just recently. Because for me, films which tend to make us think and raise several relevant questions on our problematic life patterns are in fact very important to see & discuss for our own betterment of life.Honestly, I really wished to include it in my list of 'Movies To See Before You Die'because of its considerate, realistic depiction of Friendship, Sex and Love Marriage as often seen in our own local surroundings. But unfortunately the cinematic limitations of the film restrict me to do so and therefore I would be sharing all my burning thoughts on its effective theme in a different individual article instead.Nevertheless, till then allow me to leave you with the following gutsy dialogue of RANGREZZ which might make you see the mirror right in the front more truthfully and I will soon post the write-up taking it forward from here only. \"Bhai, Shadi To Hum Karwa Denge, Par Pehle Apne Lover Couple Se Ek Baar Puch Lo, Ke MANDAP Hi Chahiye Ya Ek KAMRA Bhi Chalega.

            "Geraftaar is now considered a cult classic. One of the best masala movie of 80's. It has engaging performance throughout. The movie is filled with typical Bollywood clichés of the time. Kamal Hasan plays an innocent victim of murder. He successfully apes Sammo Hung in a funny martial arts sequence involving a bench. Amitabh plays Kamal Hasan's long lost brother with his his own back-story involving the murder of his friend. Rajnikant almost steals the film in the cameo appearance in the role of Amitabh's friend. This movie also known for the appearance of hilarious villains in the role of father-son by Kader Khan and Shakti Kapoor. The Duo got so successful that they repeated this same combination for next 15 years. The movie features three heroes (Amitabh Bachan, Rajnikant and Kamal Hasan) who are superstar in their own right. At the time of this movies release , Amitabh Bachan was the undisputed king of Bollywood. Any movie with his name on it, was guaranteed great opening week collection. Rajnikanth at the time was huge star in South Indian movies but was trying to mark his mark in Bollywood movies. Kamal Hasan was the rising star of Bollywood, having previously made his mark in South Indian cinema. Initially when the movie was in pipelines it has just Kamal Hasan in lead , however the producers persuade Amitabh to have a small cameo as Kamal's brother in the movie. Amitabh liked his role so much that he requested his role to be increased and roped in Rajnikant to act in the role of his friend. Later Madhvi was added his lead Heroine. During the final editing Amitabh role was increased even at the expense of lead hero Kamal Hasan. In the final cut of the movie Amitabh's role was almost as big as Kamal Hasan's. Amitabh appears just before the second half of the movie, but soon becomes the central focus of the movie.\n",

            "Dr. Varghese Kurien left for his heavenly abode on 09th September, 2012 and I am late in paying my tribute to him. I am paying my tribute through this review which is of a movie whose Dr. Kurien himself was a part of.Hailed as the Milkman of India, Dr. Kurien was the pioneer of White Revolution in India which not only substantially increased milk production in India but also systematized its collection and distribution and a network of milk cooperative societies came into existence through the relentless efforts of Dr. Kurien. This compaign known as Operation Flood, created dairy cooperatives all over rural India ensuring that the milk producers get the right price of the product and are saved from the exploitation of the middlemen.However no good work could be (and can be) done smoothly in the feudalistic and exploitative set up of India. And that's shown in director Shyam Benegal's movie - Manthan (1976) whose story was given by Dr. Kurien himself. Renowned playwright - Vijay Tendulkar wrote its screenplay and legendary Shaayar - Kaifi Aazmi wrote its dialogs.Appearing to be inspired by the real life experience of Dr. Kurien himself, the story of Manthan (the churning) starts with the arrival of a vet, Dr. Rao (Girish Karnaad) in a small village, Sanganva (Gujarat). He has been deputed by the government to start a dairy cooperative in that area. His team includes Deshmukh (Mohan Aagashe), Chandavarkar (Anant Naag) etc. Quite naturally, the local dairy owner, Mishra (Amrish Puri) who also happens to be the money-lender of the village, is not finding this activity as compatible for his exploitative business. He buys the milk from the poor milkmen of the village at very less rates and makes exorbitant profit which is now in danger due to the forming of the cooperative society in the village. On the other hand, the sarpanch, i.e., the head of the local governing body of the village (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), sees the cooperative as another means to further his power and awe in the village. The major chunk of the village population is made by the lower caste people (HARIJANS) and they look upon not only these high profile exploiters but also the urban incomers as their enemies only, mighty but unreliable. Their leader is a good-hearted but arrogant and short-tempered youth, Bhola (Nasiruddin Shah).Quite naturally, the path ahead for the idealist young hero, Dr. Rao is thorny and stony. But he decides not to compromise with his ideals and not to get awed by the might of the opposers. He considers all human-beings as equal and endeavours to involve the HARIJAN milkmen in the cooperative society so that the purpose of the cooperative movement is served in the real sense. Bhopa first misunderstands him but once seeing his pious intentions, he joins the society with his caste brethren. Dr. Rao also gets ample moral support from a sensible and mature milkwoman - Bindu (Smita Patil). However where on one hand, Mishra is conspiring against Dr. Rao and the cooperative society, the sarpanch after losing the election of the chairman of the cooperative society to a HARIJAN youth, goes against them on the other. Mishra gets the support of the drunkard and wicked husband of Bindu in his evil scheme and he makes many moves simultaneously to jolt Dr. Rao and his endeavours and grind his own axe. The sarpanch finally arranges the calling back of Dr. Rao to his original place through a government order. However by this time, the poor as well as the oppressed masses have identified their collective strength through the inspiration of Bhola and they do not allow the cooperative society to lose its existence despite the return of Dr. Rao and his team.Manthan is technically superior and the complete rural milieu has got enlivened on the screen. Several real villagers have also acted in the movie. Every frame (and every character) appears to be real. The length of the movie is not much but whatever is there, the narrative proves to be thoroughly engrossing for the viewer. There is no laxity or boredom anywhere. Music director Vanraj Bhatia has made background score according to the mood of the movie. There is only one song - Mero Gaam Katha Paare, Jahaan Doodh Ki Nadiya Baahe in the movie for which Preeti Saagar won the Filmfare award for the best female playback singer. It's a Gujarati lyric penned by Niti Saagar. And now this famous song with a clip from the movie is always used as a part of the advertisement of Amul.The famous theatre personality, playwright and actor - Girish Karnaad has excelled in the lead role of Dr. Rao. The film also features another pillar of Indian theatre - Mohan Aagashe. Many actors who were introduced to the Indian cine-audience through the parallel cinema movement of the seventies are there in this movie, viz. Smita Patil, Nasiruddin Shah, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Anant Naag etc. are there and everyone of them has left his / her mark through admirable performance. Late Amrish Puri with his peculiar dialog delivery amuses the audience despite being in a negative role.As rightly said by Bhola to Dr. Rao in the movie that it's easy to talk about ideals (or begin with them) but the real achievement is to stick to them even when everything goes against the protagonist. The idealism of most of the idealists loses its steam and even its breath midway because they are not strong from inside to endure the adverse times. All the same, the ending scene of Manthan declares loud and clear that an idealist may lose, the ideal doesn't.\n",

            "Once again, Raj Kapoor produces a nice and touching movie.The movie has a basic theme: dacoits against the law. But in between those two barriers is Raju (Raj Kapoor), a simple and honest fellow, who is pure as the Ganga River...hence the title. He is a dafli wala.The story begins when the Sardar of a gang of Dakkus is shot by a police officer. When Raju passes by, singing in a quite jolly way, the Sardar points a gun at him, and tells Raju to take out any weapons that he has. Raju reaches into his bag and takes out his most powerful weapon...a fork. Yes, a fork, obviously Raju isn't a very violent person. In fact, he ties the wound, and feeds the man. When the Sardar becomes unconscious, Raju is worried. When he hears sounds outside, he comes out and says, \"Khabardaar, mein police officer hoon\" (Don't dare, I'm a police officer). Misunderstanding this, the dakkus kidnap Raju.Here he has to prove to the unbelieving dacoits and their families that he is indeed just a dafliwala, and not a police officer. He shows off his talent, and some believe him and some don't.One of the people who don't believe Raju is Rakka (Pran). He is very suspicious and is annoyed at Raju. Why is he annoyed, you ask? Because the village girl that Rakka wants to marry, Kammo (Padmini) starts to like Raju. And just as predicted, they want to get married. Kammo explains to him that the dakkus aren't bad, and that they just want to make the rich and the poor equal.Ha, and Raju believes it.But he soon finds out about their ruthless crime, especially Rakka, who kills a little boy and the brand new groom of a wedding where they were to steal. Raju can't take it any more, and he decides that he has a lot of problems to solve, not just with the dakkus, but with the police too...who he thinks stoop just as low to stop crime. His journey of love and justice starts here.So that's basically the plot. Actingwise, many were impressive. Raj Kapoor, as usual, suited and flawlessly played his role. It's nice to know that he produced a movie with such a nice theme. And Pran was no less, he played his role with just as much intensity, and...I'm sad to say...had a better hair style than our Raj. Hey, but that's okay right? Lalita Pawar was very nice, and she also made me cry. Padmini overacted in a few parts, but her role was not too influential so it didn't really matter that much.And last but not least...the music! Beautiful. Every bit of it, from the songs to the background score. Shankar Jaikishan once again makes a perfect soundtrack for Raj Kapoor. Lata, as usual, sang her heart out, captivating ours' as well. \"O Basanti\", \"O Maine Pyar Kiya\", \"Begani Shaadi Mein\", and \"Kya Hua\" are especially beautiful. The classic \"Aa Ab Laut Chale\" is magnificently sung by Mukesh, pierces the emotions...along with Lata's silk like voice in-between the stanzas. \"Mera Naam Raju\" and \"Jis Desh Mein Ganga\" are also classics sung by Mukesh. \"Hum Bhi Hain\" is also a must-listen.The movie is touching and satisfying with every element of drama. I rate it an eight out of ten. I would have rated it higher if there weren't a few deaths that were a bit unnecessary...but I guess the director can't change the story. Watch the movie! A classic!\n",

            "I have to start off by saying that i agree with the entire population when they say that the only good thing about Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat was Arjun Rampal's performance. I also have to add that i have been a fan from that moment on. Deewanapan was a very interesting movie for me to watch. It was not really an excellent movie, the plot has been done a thousand times before, and the music is average. The direction was good though but Arjun carries the entire movie on his shoulders.After a typical bollywood opening to the movie, the pace picks up and Arjun just gets better and better. After seeing this movie i believe that he can play a villan equally as well as a romantic lead. The way he changes his facial expressions in some scenes and then be someone totally different in another was great. His female lead was a bit weak though, but she improves as the movie progressess. The fight scenes are superb and i applaud Arjun's efforts. Anyone who says that this supermodel, turned actor cannot act, has to see this movie and revise that opinion.Arjun is a definite star of the future. His popularity is already growing, so watch out Hrithik, i see a storm ahead!\n",

            "All three of Raj Kapoor's sons tried their hand at direction in order to keep their father's banner alive. All three delivered rather mediocre films and PremGranth is unfortunately a weak melodramatic fare which fails to recreate the magic of Raj Kapoor's movies. Rajiv Kapoor, the youngest of Kapoor's sons, is the one who directs this movie and though he tries hard to adopt his father's style of filmmaking, Prem Grant falls flat and is a most boring, overdone and outdated product. The story seems to be like set in the 1940s, when women had no chances to survive. The film tries to address the theme of rape but it hardly manages to convey its message given the poor script and dated execution. The casting wavers between okay and laughable. The fact that Anupam Kher plays the father of Rishi Kapoor, who in real-life is actually 3 years older than he is, really made me laugh and is an example of terribly tactless casting. The only factor that redeems this film from being a total disaster is undoubtedly Madhuri Dixit, who rises above the script with a heartfelt and convincing performance in the role of a rape victim who tries to move on in life. Some of her scenes after the birth of her child were truly good. But there it ends, and the presence of a ceaselessly beautiful Dixit is not enough to save a stale story of this sort.\n",

            "Frankly speaking there is nothing much to write about this rehashed madcap comic movie, which occasionally does make you laugh on some cheap jokes and dialogues. However, addressing the makers, I would like to say that we are all ready to keep our brains at home for good comedy movies and are eager enough to throw away all logics in order to have some good laughing moments in the theater. But at the same time we are also not fools to keep laughing on the same jokes cracked again under a different title. Elaborating on my above statement let me explain the process, how this quick limited budget movie must have been conceived by the makers and the team.Director Sameer Karnik's last movie was a big hit with the three Deols called YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA. If you have watched the film, then you would agree that the first half of the film was pretty weak than its second and the film actually proved a winner after its interval when the Deols meet Anupam Kher and his family in Punjab. So, taking a clue from this universal feedback, director Sameer Karnik thinks of making another quick movie majorly based on the plot used in the second half of YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA which was actually responsible for its runaway success. For this he takes almost the same star-cast featuring Kulraj Randhawa, Anupam Kher, Johny Lever, Mukul Dev and more for his key roles which are almost the same as in YPD with slight changes. Like in the present version Anupam Kher changes from a Punjabi 'Singh' to a Rajathani Royal 'Singh' and Kulraj comes straight from abroad. To add more spice to the Punjabi feel of the film, Sameer adds Om Puri along with Farida Jalal in the character of a Punjabi couple who abuse more and talk less in their local accent. Now for the hero's role since it would have been suicidal to cast (Sameer's favourite) Bobby Deol once again for the same script, therefore Tushar Kapoor is called in to show his comedy skills, which he does quite well. Further, more actors are roped in for contributing their bit in some silly sequences like Anita Raaj, Sushant Singh, Chandrachur Singh, Rahul Singh and Harish who remain completely wasted throughout the film. With everything on the plate, still a SIKH character was missing in the film, which has been a key feature of Sameer's recent movies. In fact he even made SALMAN KHAN portray a SIKH Officers role in his HEROES and then worked with the Deols in 2011. So following the same track of YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA, he makes Tushhar Kapoor enter in the getup of a loud PAPPI SARDAR, exactly like Bobby Deol did in the original. And then the climax is written with a similar vision where all the confusions get cleared after a jumbled action sequence in which even the actors don't know, with whom they are supposed to fight.Coming to the music part, since it was a low budget movie, so an already Hit track is remixed \"Chandni O Meri Chandni\" and another more than 5 years old readymade Hit Punjabi Pop track \"Kangna Tera Ni\" (Dr. Zeus) is added into it to woo the Northern belt. But the Cinematography remains the same reminding you of all those funny sequences in the second half of YPD. Here I would also like to mention the avoidable incorporation of \"Croma Technique\" used for the scenes where Tushhar is talking from abroad, which also gives you the idea of its nature of quick production. Plus exploiting Punjab and the repeated use of DDLJ syndrome in a film script has now crossed the boundary to reach the tag of \"Over-Used\".In short, the above might have been the recipe of making CHAAR DIN KI CHANDNI in a short span of time in order to encash the already HIT plot of director's last successful venture. The film does have its moments and few enjoyable performances too namely of Tushhar, Kulraj, Anupam Kher and Om Puri, which are capable of making you smile. Yet I really couldn't laugh whole heartedly on all the similar sequences once more in these new settings. But if you don't mind laughing on the same joke again, then the choice is all yours.\n",

The trouble begins when a man catches a glimpse of a beautiful woman, sets out his plans to win her with the help of his friend but ultimately bringing tragedy on their collective heads. It's a simple quintessential Bollywood tale that unfolds on the screen, it definitely looks more complex in print! Although Waheeda Rehman and Guru Dutt never looked lovelier it was really the incomparable Rafi's film, from the mesmerisingly sung soft Technicolor Chaudvin Ka Chand to the heartbroken b&w Mili Khak Mein Mohabbat; Asha had a fine song in Dil Ke Kahaani (also in Technicolor), while Lata shone with Badle Badle in atmospheric melancholic b&w.

This movie also reunited Big B with Shashi Kapoor, who were last seen in Namak Halaal. Unfortunately the end product is a pretty average effort. To be honest I hadn't seen it in it's entirety for at least a decade. As a movie it shouldn't have worked at all but it remains watchable thanks to Big B, who carries the movie on his shoulders. He is really intense in this movie, which is what the audience at the time expected at the time from him. That said even he isn't able to salvage the mediocre material. He is supported by a decent cast in supporting roles, consisting of Jackie Shroff, Meenakshi, Amrita Singh and Aditya Pancholi and a special appearance by Helen. There isn't really a script to speak of really, the entire movie is basically Amitabh confronting the villains again and again. The main villain himself, Keith Stevenson is very weak. I am wondering why the directors went for him when they could have found a better villain like Amrish Puri or Raza Murad etc. Stevenson really hams it up with a double role. The songs are decent, particularly Aag lag jaye, which is a great song. All in all I think without Big B's performance it would have been a much worse movie than it is.\n",

            "Siddhi Vinayak Creation's Aksar 2 (A) directed by Ananth Narayan Mahadevan is a story about seizing money and property.Dolly Khambata's (Lillette Dubey) governess dies in a road accident. Her financial adviser Patrick Sharma (Gautam Rode), hires Sheena Roy (Zarine Khan) for the post of Dolly's governess. Sheena lies to Patrick that she is single as only single women can handle that job. In reality she has a boyfriend Ricky (Abhinav Shukla). Patrick is sexually attracted to Sheena. He forces Sheena to sleep with him as he gave her the job. After Sheena sleeps with Patrick, she tells him about a secret regarding the will which Dolly made. This secret keeps Patrick in tension for a long time. What was it that made him anxious? the rest forms the crux of the story.The story of this film is penned by Narendra Bajaj and its boring right from the second act of the film. Such a routine plot is not at all appealing to any section of the audience. Sunjiv Puri's screenplay is not thrilling at all. The suspense of the film doesn't excite the audience at all. The movie is so slow in the first half that it completely distracts you and keeps no excitement.Zarine Khan's acting is not at all impressive. She fail's to make a good screen presence. One the other hand Gautam Rode's acting is good but due to it's dull script, his character doesn't shine well. Lillette Dubey's acting is good in parts. the rest of the cast is so-so. Ananth Narayan Mahadevan's direction could have been better. Of course, one will have more expectations from a National Award winning director, but he ruins the expectations of the audience as the film lacks the thrill element. So overall his direction is average. Cinematography by Maneesh Bhatt is poor. Ananth's editing is also loose, it's not at all sharp. Aaj Zid is the only song that is melodious.On the whole, Aksar 2 is a complete disaster. This kind of film will hardly find any audience. It's an annoying show all the way.\n",

            "This movie is winner in all fronts. A different storyline from the typical bollywood melodrama sets it apart from others.This story is about four friends who are educated but unemployed and how they are dragged into doing wrong things. Then they are introduced to a family (mother and her daughter (manda) who helps these four friends to look at life from a different perspective.After being with this family for some time the whole outlook and behavior of these four friends totally changes and they try to look at the life from a positive angle. At this time manda is raped by her boss and his friends. When the four friends get this news, they are shattered and now their only aim is to revenge the rape.The storyline is simple, but told in a bold fashion. Acting from all those involved is good, especially Nana Patekar, he is just mind-boggling. This is the best offering from N. Chandra the director, who all directed super-hit film like Tezaab. He is convinced about the characters and that is shown in the movie.So if you like to see something different, then this is the movie for you. Just don't miss it. 8 out of 10.\n",

Reema Sen is Very Pretty and Sexy and id like to get naughty with her indeed. Its quite unfair that she doesn't make much Movies. What i liked best about this film is Fardeen's character, a drunk, heavy smoker and womaniser guy whom doesn't believe in love. The movie is literally about Fardeen and his life of women. He pays women for Pleasure until he has his eye for Reema. Reema refuses his offer. The story moves on to a dilemma, where Reema is left in the middle of the street alone. She cant go to her mothers house, and she has no where else to go. Fardeen offers her to stay at his house until she's settled. Thats when the romance blossoms. Great direction. The Music was brilliant. My Favourite song was Pehli Baar. This is a great attempt by Fardeen and highly recommended. Must See\n",

            "Rajat Kapoor's 'Fatso!' is an underrated romantic-comedy, that turns out to be nice fun! Its not perfect, but it has some great moments, that stay with you.'Fatso!' Synopsis: Navin dies in an accident, but returns in a different avatar to woo his love.'Fasto!' makes good use of its interesting premise, which is heavily inspired by the classics Heaven Can Wait & and Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Kapoor & Saurabh Shukla's Screenplay is capable, although the final 30-minutes are a bit underwhelming, as the pace drops. But otherwise, this romantic-comedy, scores higher on light moments. Kapoor's Direction is decent.Performance-Wise: Ranvir Shorey is extraordinary in his portrayal of a Fatso. What a natural, nuanced performance from this supremely talented actor! Gul Panag looks gorgeous & delivers earnestly. Purab Kohli is likable. Neil Bhoopalam is superb. Gunjan Bakshi is okay. Brijendra Kala is fantastic. He steals all the scenes he appears in!On the whole, 'Fatso!' needs to be watched for its fun elements & fine performances.\n",

Hats off to Mani Shankar .... his best work till date. The movie is about a MUKHBIR(informer) working for Indian Intelligence, the movie revolves around what risks,losses and sacrifices he has to face in this dangerous profession. The best thing about the movie is its realism.. If u r expecting a masala entertainer then m sorry... it has only 1 or 2 songs and nothing else except an excellent story..no comedy even . The movie did bad business at Box Office and the credit goes to: 1.its promoters who forgot that even a brilliant movie like this needs good promotion and marketing..so many people didn't knew about the movie .also the movie released with very few prints..it was released at only 4 theaters in Delhi, thankfully one of these theaters was near to my place 2. Immature audiences : no further comments 3.Some other grown up immature kids called CRITICS.... they suck\n",

            "The very inception of the film gives a feeling of it being ghost- directed by Rituparno Ghosh. But, the germs of it being the first film of a director under Rituparno's tutelage can be made out after one has gone through a considerable portion of the film. Excepting these discussions, what we glean from movie is a so-called aberrant sexuality which, it says, is not to be looked down upon by the fortunate heterosexuals of this world. Arati (Deepti Naval) - the mother, finding it hard to come to terms with and to switch her emotions between her son's sudden death and his homosexuality hitherto unknown to her - at first detests Ornub (Rituparno), but subsequently starts cherishing his company taking him to be her dead son's 'special' someone or her another alive son. Another relation, between Sahana (Raima Sen) and Arati, is also a very pleasant one founded on honesty and respect. Arati, during her short stay at her dead son's house, learns about certain grim truths about this world which, heretofore even her grey hair has not shown her. When she leaves, she leaves with a bagful of warm closeness she has unknowingly amassed within these few days from both Ornub and Sahana and leaves behind with them 'a bit of' herself and her dead son. The background melody and the nominal songs accentuate the situations. To draw the conclusion we can say that 'Memories in March' is a good attempt at narration, though with a profusion of Rituparnovian touches.\n",

I have high expectation from this because of SHiv Pandit as a lead here, already watched and liked his acting in Shaitaan and Mumbai Delhi Mumbai. This one was complete different thriller movie and looks inspired from Holly movie Man on a Ledge. Writing and Direction is too week for such an amazing story. Shiv Pandit shines in his role but he is not the main lead and his screen presence is limited and Sandeepa Dhar was almost okay on her role but her over the top cop image was unbelievable. Varun Badola repeated his role of Mickey Virus and provide comic relief to this serious thriller. One more actor who plays Hacker and mastermind of this game was superb but his screen presence too limited and Contract killer and main villain was too irritating. Himanshu malik was OK in his 2 scenes. You can avoid this as thriller and writing was very weak as compare to Mickey Virus but its a new and fresh story at least for Bollywood.\n",

            "Karz has lots of action, and it is a typical revenge story. This is fine, and Sunny Deol goes perfect in action; Sunil Shetty does well. Only one small problem is in the very last scene. When Sunny jumps into a train car and kicks the main baddie, Ashutosh Rana (psycho villain and coward), Sunny is suddenly shot thrice, but then he bounces back and brutally bashes the baddie to death; surprisingly, the 'dhai kilo ka haath' was enough to kill the baddie! Now to be honest, Sunny's character unwittingly dies, which kind of makes the ending a little abrupt. This part makes no sense, and it is unfair to Sunny, because his character is one that fights too much to get his life straight, and he deserves the right to a newer and better and happier life, and NOT die. Only this aspect chops off 1 pt. from this vote. This kind of reminds me of Jeet in this regard. Having said that, just like Jeet (Sunny as main hero with a 2nd fiddle and heroine; also seen here), Karz also could have easily done without Sunny's character dying because tragic endings are NOT well-received, and they do NOT fit the story, unless the hero was a famous martyr. Another thing, the good cop, who was helping Sunny, was NOT even in the climax. Where was he? He should have been there! Anyways, the movie is NOT bad or anything, just avoid tragic endings! Johnny Lever in the 1st half is funny!\n",

One is Talpade's recovery of the lost gun and second is the extremists who has hopelessly fallen in love. Between the two there are adequate moments to tickle your funny bone.Ξ Shreyas Talpade:: He did full justice to his role. After Welcome to Sajjanpur its an honest performance. And he was dashing in the getup of Security In-Charge at the climax of the movie.Ξ Kay Kay:: Gives another shot to attempt comedy (after Sankat City) - but given what he is, he is impeccable. Irfan Khan and Kay Kay are like Om Puri & Naseeruddin Shah of contemporary times.Ξ Vijay Maurya:: Another actor to watch out for. As always he is exceptional in his delivery.Ξ Mahie Gill:: Pity after \"Dev D\" I was expecting her to choose wisely. There was hardily any meat in the role and was reduced to a poster girl with one song thrown in.Ξ Shenaz Treasurywala:: Needs acting classes badly. Facial expression doesn't qualify to be termed as acting. And to pitting opposite Kay Kay is a big No-No! The mini-me romantic track couple ie. Shiv Pandit and Shruti Seth were okay'ish - its their characters which were foolish.The rest of the star-cast was adequate. The song sung by Shenaz deserves a special mention. For a first-time director its not a bad fare.There are only three shortcomings in the movie:: 1. The title is not remotely connected to the plot. It should have given an inkling of plot something like misadventures of lost gun, 2. The movie should have been trimmed to give it a punch.3. A few subplots should have been avoided as it made audience lose connectivity.\n",

Also starring Leone's real-life partner, Daniel Webber, the film is evidently made only to cash in on the lead actress' probable fame and sexual appeal. The film starts with an item song picturing a scantily-clad Leone, and from there, it's a downward spiral.With cringe-worthy dialogues and unimaginative interactions between the characters, the film dramatically screws up without any hope of resurrection.BOTTOM LINE: Akshit Golakiya's \"Beiimaan Love\" is a unsatisfactory film made only to satisfy the male gaze.

The story shows the importance of mothers and the sacrifices they make for their families. I admit not everyone is lucky in life to get a good mother, but it's nice to see what a good mother should be like. Family films like Pardes and KKKG go over the top and show Indian and Western culture in such stupid ways. It was refreshing to watch this movie which combines both eastern and western things in a good way. Rekha's performance and beauty was superb, and Sharman was amazing too. It was good to see Anupam Kher given a solid and truly supportive role. The only thing I thought was out of place was Shweta Kumar's dance in the temple - good dance moves, but less of a bhajan and more of a college performance.\n",

            "Whenever there is a new concept in Hollywood, people do get inspired all over the world and Hindi cinema is no exception. There were films made dealing with 'Split personality' in Hindi but only few of them really pay tributes to the concept and one of them was Deewangee. It is well known that concept by itself is always good and appealing but a worst implementation does spoil the concept and drive audiences away. One such worst execution of a beautiful, poetential story line was greatly demonstrated in Chaahat ek nasha by none other than Partho Ghosh of Agni Sakshi fame. this brings me to the film \"Madhoshi\".This film is evidently based on the concept of \"Beautiful mind\" based on the life of a mathematical genius John Nash (played by Russel Crowe). I have not seen the English movie for my weakness in English. The heart of the story is the 'disease' Schrizophernia. It is said that there is no known cure of the disease. Given this non-existence of a successful method of treating a patient with such a problem, one tries their own method/attempt. Hence we should not laugh at any such method as it is very case specific.I must say that the treatment of the subject is first rate. Now I am motivated to see 'beautiful mind'. I recommend Madhoshi to all those who want to see 'beautiful mind' but cannot follow the language. This Indian version is good enough by itself that deserves a watch!\n",

            "Ah, Gulzar! The poet and the filmmaker, above all, an artiste in the truest sense. What sets 'Namkeen' apart from his other works is that this one has a more Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Shyam Benegal feel to it rather than the Gulzar signature. It is one of his lesser known films. 'Namkeen' too is a story of unfulfilled love (like 'Ijaazat', 'Aandhi' and 'Mausam') but here the story is given a more slice of life treatment, a glimpse into the characters' life, rather than having it 'follow a plot'.'Namkeen' has a lyrical feel to it (a common factor in Gulzar's movies) and the landscape (I'm assuming it's in Darjeeling) is breathtaking. The characters are easy to relate to and endearing. There are only about two or three songs but they are beautifully visualized and the lyrics are mesmerizing.Gulzar beautifully displays Jyoti and her three daughters' struggle to get by every day. These are poor people and their daily concern is winning bread and other necessary requirements such as oil. They don't have time to fall in love but that doesn't mean that they don't have dreams. A voiceless Mitthu expresses her words in poetry while the youngest Chimki is a vivacious spirit. Nimki is the eldest one who keeps the family together as she takes care of all the household activities and makes sure that all the requirements are met while the hardworking mother, Jyoti, is at work all day. Gerulal brings a pleasant change to their lives.Sanjeev Kumar, once again, plays a part only he could do justice to. Waheeda Rehman is barely recognizable. Not only does she look different but even her voice is distinct from what we're familiar with. She's clearly a master of her craft. The same can be said of Sharmila Tagore and Shabana Azmi who are nothing short of remarkable. Kiran Vairale is vivacious as the lively young Chimki.'Namkeen' is one of Gulzar's most underrated works and it is a treat to watch. Thanks to Gulzar for giving us a glimpse of the lives of these colourful characters.\n",

I've seen Little Zizou twice at film festivals, and hope to see it again on a big screen in a US theatre -- it's so fresh, funny, smart, and accessible. Parsi people from India love the depiction of their unique world, and I have totally loved the glimpse this movie gives me.Zizou, a cool-eyed boy, is our guide to his busy universe. He's ignored by a foolish father with a messiah complex all about \"Parsi Purity.\" He watches the romantic adventures of his teen-age brother (his graphic novels appear on screen from time to time), longs for the mom he lost at birth, and schemes for the love of the mom next door. The happily-married dad next door and lover of old Rosemary Clooney tunes, Boman Irani (the always-appealing and charismatic character actor), is an adult moral center, as a newsman who knows dangerous nonsense when he sees it and is ready to do what it takes to oppose it.Sooni Taraporevala, who has collaborated as a writer on many of Mira Nair's projects, gives us a sketch of the insanity of religious secularism, drawn with a light touch and observed by kids who are free of illusion and delightfully involved in lives, loves, and plots of their own.Director, almost all the actors, and most of the characters in the story are Parsis, members of the Zoroastrian group that fled Persia for India about 1000 years ago and are still a colorful thread in the fabric of life in Mumbai. An exception is the sweet and glamorous Bollywood star John Abraham, who puts in a dreamy special appearance. All performances are stellar - besides Boman I particularly loved Zenobia Shroff as the warm and sexy mom next door, and her actual mom, Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, as her beautiful, blowsy movie mom.PS just learned DVD will be released in India July 09.

            "I'm giving NOT A LOVE STORY half of a good rating - because that's exactly what the film gave me - HALF of the story. This exploitative \"documentary\" is completely biased and shows absolutely no objectivity in the subject-matter and was obviously created by someone with a personal vendetta against the adult-entertainment industry.We basically follow a woman (who I assume is the director) as she recruits stripper Fonda Peters to go to different peep-show houses and strip-clubs to talk to the owners and the girls that work there. There are a few \"round-table\" type discussions with other porn-haters and a few \"facts\" mixed in as well, and at one point, Peters volunteers for a Hustler-style photo-shoot with famous erotic photographer, Suze Randall. The \"slant\" of the film is that porn is violent and misogynistic and detrimental to women and sexuality in general...Couple of problems with all this. First off - while staging protests and talking about how \"degrading\" her photo-shoot was, Ms. Peters NEVER once seems to regret her profession as an adult-entertainer, and in fact defends herself for her choice of careers on several occasions. I found this a bit odd. For such a \"straight-and-narrow\" documentary of the perils of porn, we're treated to several scenes of sex-acts in nightclubs, a hardcore live-sex show, and several scenes from B&D types of films. What's the purpose? To me, it seemed like an exploitative attempt to \"sell\" this film to the exact market that it so blindly accuses. I also found it interesting how the film focused solely on \"roughie\" style porn and related ALL porn to that particular sub-genre. The scene where they claim that the only women who watch porn are coerced into it by their boyfriends is ridiculous too. Also - why no talk of the male sex-trade? There are plenty of male strip clubs where men are objectified - why no discussion on that topic? The reason is because as soon as the roles are reversed, then it's a non-issue. Obviously men could NEVER be looked at as \"objects\" or \"exploited\", right? This sort of thing could ONLY happen to luckless women forced into this horrid profession. Personally - I think it's all bullsh!t. I have no sympathy for anyone (male or female) who as an adult chooses their path in life. There are very few cases (if any) of a woman (or man) being forced into the types of peep-show establishments or porn industry in general portrayed in this film. It's this constant cry-baby finger-pointing and lack of taking personal responsibility that has begun the gradual downfall of this country.NOT A LOVE STORY is semi-entertaining in terms of watching these early 1980s women's-libers get all uptight about sex. The \"message\" itself is so obviously skewed as to be laughable - and there is a good bit of explicit nudity so that made it tolerable too. True documentary fans will see this film as the joke that it is - other porn-haters and staunch anti-porn feminists will probably salute this film as an important work to further their \"cause\", and then masturbate to the sex-scenes when no one is there to hold them accountable...5/10\n",

Reason? Stellar Performances & A (mostly) Well-Written Screenplay.'Moh Maya Money' Synopsis: A young real-estate broker (Ranvir Shorey) tries to pull off a huge scam, which goes horribly wrong. To fix everything he involves his begrudging wife (Neha Dhupia) leading to an end neither could imagine.'Moh Maya Money' is a gritty-thriller, that involves heinous crimes & moments of unexpected cruelty. Munish keeps the narrative going on a strong pace all through its first-hour, building up a story that's a lot more than what you might expect out of it. The characters are mean, greedy, deceptive & their world is undeniably engrossing. BUT, only in the first-hour. In its second-hour, 'Moh Maya Money' loses out its unpredictable nature & even the sequences that follow one after the other, lack excitement. Even the culmination, looks hurried & cramped. Munich & Mansi Nirmal Jain's Screenplay begins excellently, but fails to sustain its momentum. The Writing plays a spoilsport towards the latter hour & how one wishes if the Writers opted for some better material. Munish's Direction is well-done. 'Moh Maya Money' is a triumph as far as the acting is concerned. Ranvir Shorey is fantastic as the calculative, conniving protagonist, who's impossible to like, but hard to hate either. Shorey brings depth to a part, that zeroes on being bad. Neha Dhupia is brilliant too. Dhupia enacts a complicated yet meaty part, with unmistakable conviction. And the on-screen chemistry between the two, is as real as it can get. Seriously, why don't we get to see Shorey & Dhupia more often on the big screen? On the whole, 'Moh Maya Money' isn't perfect, but it's worth a watch nonetheless, thanks to its superior first-hour & faultless performances.\n",

Mammo was born in Panipat during the British Raj, but she was one of those many Muslims who left for Pakistan after partition, automatically becoming Pakistani citizens. After the death of her beloved husband, Mammo is thrown out of the house by her relatives, and having nowhere else to go, comes to live with her widowed sister in Bombay on a temporary visa. Lots of things change while she is there, Mammo is loud, vivacious, opinionated and funny, and she keeps everyone on their toes. Initially unhappy with her presence, Riyaz learns to love the old lady and ultimately gets very close to her.Mammo is a brilliant film, superbly written, directed and acted. It is both entertaining and touching. Shyam Benegal is as already known a true master of his craft. He keeps everything so real and authentic. The film's dialogues and script are exceptional. The relationships are portrayed wonderfully, and Benegal must be applauded for his simple and natural presentation of the three characters and their everyday struggles, through which we get to know of their stories and life experiences. Benegal skillfully captures the atmosphere of those times; the music, the streets, the films, everything is so realistically depicted. At times it felt like a real documentation of a period of time in the lives of these three people. The movie has drama, comedy, and many moments of joy, happiness and rage we all are familiar with. The story unfolds as seen through the eyes of the young Riyaz. Benegal shows us in minute detail who Mammo was, and clarifies why Mammo occupied such a special place in Riyaz's heart. She was not only a mother figure to him, she could be a friend, a confidant, a spiritual teacher, and generally just a person who could be counted on anytime. Everyone would want to have an aunt like Mammo, an open-minded, honest and straightforward person, who is both funny and likable. I cannot forget the scenes in which she caught Riyaz smoking and promised him to keep it between them or the scene in which she herself asks him to light a cigarette for her and starts smoking. Another memorable scene is the one where Fayyazi gets mad as she finds out porn magazines in Riyaz's closet while Mammo reacts naturally to this, with complete understanding that the boy is now grown. This is such an amazing character.I can really see why Khalid Mohammed wanted to immortalise Mammo by making her the central character of a feature film. It is partly a comic, partly a dramatic character, and it is just a very inspiring one. She was not only a caring and unselfish person who was always willing to help, she was evidently a strong woman who knew how to take things as they come, live with what God had given her and thank him, and she also had the ability to call a spade a spade and frankly tell her opinion about a person directly in his face. This can be seen in several scenes such as the one in which she attacks her sister Anwari for stealing her and Fayyazi's property. One more scene is the one in which she preaches housemaid Shantabai's husband for drinking and abusing his wife.But the main reason Mammo will always be remembered is Farida Jalal. This is not only one of her finest performances, this is according to me one of the greatest performances by an actress in a leading role in Hindi cinema. Jalal's portrayal of Mammo is marvelous from start to finish. She is amazingly natural and plays her role with soul, depth and humour, making Mammo so easy to relate to and so easy to like. One can really see the pain in her eyes as she reminisces past incidents, and yet her way to accept what she has and move on is admirable. I cannot see anyone but Jalal in this role. This is an unforgettable performance. Surekha Sikri as the worried and caring Fayyazi is nothing short of excellent, and she too manages to move you in many of her scenes. Amit Phalke plays the young Riyaz exceedingly well, and so does Rajit Kapoor playing the older version of this role.Mammo is not only an impressive piece of art, it is also a fantastic entertainer which would be certainly enjoyed by the entire family. One has to note Jagjit Singh's wonderful Ghazal which can be heard from time to time. In a few words, Mammo is another masterwork by the great Shyam Benegal - a haunting, moving, involving and riveting tale of one little family. This is a true cinematic experience, one gem of a movie.\n",

            "One of the most talented actress of the present times, Tabu, returns on the screen in a family comedy, which sadly falls flat and fails to impress. As a matter of fact, director Kedarh Shinde's \"Toh Baat Pakki\" seems to be a miniature attempt in front of the gigantic acting talent of the veteran as he simply couldn't take advantage of her gracious presence on the screen due to his ineffective and lifeless execution of the subject. The potential comedy plot which could have been an enjoyable family drama on the lines of Hrishikesh Mukherjee kind of cinema gets wasted because of a spineless script and mediocre direction.Revolving around the story of an ambitious lady, who wants to get her sister married to the world's best bachelor, the movie starts off well with an enjoyable wedding sequence. In fact the opening scenes clearly give you an idea that it's going to be a Tabu movie all the way, which in turn raises the expectation level to another height. But the subsequent scenes after the fine start, move at an extremely slow speed and that too without any good comic punches to make you feel better. The sluggish development of the actual plot, takes away all the joyful spirit of a supposedly comedy movie and creates friction. The director unexpectedly reveals the main twist of the story just close to the intermission and then shows all the real action between his different characters in the second half.Before that the movie manages to impress the viewer partly with its simple and easy going narration. It even gives you few glimpses of the famous and impactful family comedies of the 70s. But after the initial one hour both the writer and the director realize that they still haven't revealed the real plot and then go on to move the story at a contrasting speed. And that gives rise to a silly kind of a second half with many hurriedly added developments into the storyline. The script tries to incorporate a number of happenings post interval, which seems to be quite unrealistic and hard to believe for the viewer. Truly speaking, after the intermission you remain seated in the theater only because of Tabu and to some extent Sharman Joshi, still visible on the screen. Otherwise there is no worth mentioning name, scene or sequence in the movie to write praises about in its concluding hour.Apart from these flaws, the movie is too lengthy and loaded with many uninspiring and un-required songs to put you off. As per its plot, a sweet 90 min movie should have been perfect. But the director goes on deliberately stretching it to an intolerable level which becomes the main drawback of the movie and will be the foremost reason of its failure. Only one song \"Jis Din Mera Byaah\" and its repetitive use, both in the movie and in its promotional campaign could have done the trick. All the other songs from \"Pritam\" are just the routine ones.Performance wise, Tabu once again proves her versatility and is a real treat to watch. She simply steals the limelight from every actor on the screen with a natural ease. Sharman Joshi impresses in his boy next door act and makes his presence felt even in the scenes along with Tabu. Yuvika Chaudhary as the girl to be married has a lovable smile but she seriously has to look after her styling, especially her hair styles. At times she looks gorgeous, but in few scenes she seems to be just an above average face due to her improper appearance. Despite of the fact that the story moves around her character alone, Yuvika doesn't get enough scenes or dialogues to prove herself. Vatsal Sheth as the second boy in the lead is strictly OK. Ayub Khan, Himani Shivpuri and Suhasini Mulay are just there performing another routine kind of act in their careers. Upasana Singh is shouting as always and Sharat Saxena's tries his best to generate some laughter. However, his pehalwan and kidnapping angle towards the climax could have been used in a more amusing manner.Summing up, I would like to say that like director Kedarh Shinde, there are numerous other film-makers in Bollywood who are more or less highly inspired from the family comedy movies of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee. They all keep on trying to bring back those fond memories of the past with projects such as \"Toh Baat Paaki\". Hence, even if the movie is not that impressive in its content and execution, it still is a good attempt if compared to all those silly, childish but Hit comedies seen in the recent years.\n",

It looked promising. But when I actually started watching the movie, it was a torture! The main lead has acted OK. the 'Sesky' is used a lot and sounded pretty stupid. His dance is good. But hey, acting is just not dancing. The the other cast of this movie are 'just OK'.The story is the worst! It is not interesting at all. Its stupid.

Jeetendra is not too bad, even though he makes similar movies all the time. The two actresses Madhuri look damn sexy as usual. Jayepradha is not too bad. Thanedaar is a typical olden day bollywood film about the child who witnesses his father get killed and wants revenge. He ends up being separated from his elder brother. This film has enough comedy and action to keep you entertained. A movie with a good director that has made good films in the past.

            "As a pleasantly surprising, light entertainer coming from Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi, the insightful director of CHANAKYA (TV Series), PINJAR and the recent UPANISHAD GANGA (TV Series), ZED PLUS can easily be rated as one of the best political satires in the recent times supported by some exceptional dialogues & performances without shouting it loud or going overboard in its more than two hours of duration.Yes, it reminds you of a few films based on somehow similar concepts and is not a perfect classic as I felt towards the end. But still would like you to watch it considering a refreshing change from the typical romantic comedies and action movies thrown one after another promoted by few big names. In other words, if you wish to witness a film that can simply be called a director's project from start to finish then ZED PLUS is the one to go for. Performed well by many underrated actors in full control of their director, it's based on a very carefully written script which is in fact a delight to watch for most of its time and doesn't disappoint hugely post its intermission too. Beginning with some superb sarcastic comments on the governing people, it takes a good 15-20 minutes for the introductions and then begins the fun quickly maintaining the pace throughout till those (sadly) predictable concluding moments which could have been given a different turn. So its only the final 30 minutes of the film that make you feel watching something obvious and seen before diluting the overall impact of the movie putting it honestly. But as a whole it certainly comes as a much needed relief among the silly crap regularly being offered by Bollywood makers with an amazing consistency.Actually the best part of ZED PLUS that makes it worth recommending is its story telling, particularly the dialogues full of many brilliant witty remarks, idioms and representation of many recent developments in the country discussed all over. For instance watch out the way it portrays the confusion or debate over the use of Hindi and English in our government matters, VIP culture getting an added advantage disturbing the everyday life of a common man, the media playing a big role in the country's active politics, terrorism used as a triumph card by the shrewd leaders of all parties and how corruption and sudden easy money pollutes a simple, honest mind too without taking much time in just a few weeks. Personally I loved the ringtone insertion of Vande Matram and the look alike prime minister used very subtly by the thinking director so well in its key sequences.The script intelligently crafts a fine buildup after the initial introductions and then the superb performers take over from there, impressing you gradually as the story progresses. Adil Hussain as the puncturewala, takes time to grow on the viewers. But once he does, the actor proves his hidden caliber that made Dr. Dwivedi select him among many other known names that could have helped the movie commercially in pure business terms. Adil beautifully portrays the role of a simple man who at first could even allow a passenger to walk away without paying and then later becomes a greedy, selfish man looking at the opportunities coming his way in the film's second half.Mukesh Tiwari as Adil's childhood friend delivers another polished performance showing his already proved versatility yet again. Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Prime Minister is a perfect choice resembling our current Prime Minister of the country and he is a treat to watch. K. K. Raina, another under-rated actor of our industry plays the PM's personal assistant to perfection. Rahul Singh as the security in-charge, Shivani Tanksale as Fauziya & Ekavali Khanna as Saeeda prove their talent quite boldly, whereas Sanjay Mishra once again becomes the cause of laughter heard in the theater with his repetitive yet superb act of an unknown terrorist looking for his chance to make a big name in the news media. Plus it was great to see Liliput on the screen after a long time as the petty thief among many other familiar talented faces in the supporting cast.However, the surprising fact remains that Mona Singh turns out to be the second best performer after Adil in the film playing the homely, lovable, honest wife witnessing the change coming in his husband's persona with the changing times. And she truly nails it enacting her given character wonderfully and you are sure going to see a different Mona here than all her previous performances till date.Musically, Dr. Dwivedi uses only a few songs and that too as \"Sutradhar\" tracks sung by Sukhwinder making an enjoyable screen appearance too along with Hrishitaa Bhatt with her well-choreographed dance moves. The songs set the mood right and so does the cinematography and background music of the film taking you into the ambiance of a small town with all realistic likable character as seen around us in our daily lives.Summing up, admittedly many might find it based on a wafer thin & unconvincing plot taking time to grow on the viewer in its initial hour having some underdeveloped side tracks too such as the Sanjay Mishra one. Moreover where the first half can easily be drawn parallels with films like PEEPLI LIVE, the latter makes you recall some earlier much famous political satires such as KISSA KURSI KA, AAJ KA M.L.A RAM AVTAR and more. Yet, I would like to rate ZED PLUS as an attempt above them all due to its simplicity, truthfulness and a well written authentic portrayal of all real life characters capable of transporting you into a different world altogether in its two hours.So do give it a chance and try not to miss watching this fairly enjoyable, well intentioned comical, political satire in the theaters as the latest pleasant offering from Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi.\n",

            "One of the best given the topic 'Terrorism'. Remember, this movie was made in 1994, much before 9/11 and yet, one can see the similarities between 9/11 plot and this movie. For example, 9/11 hijackers hid among us, just as the terrorists in this movie wore the mask of a common man. 9/11 hijackers were known to be soft spoken and polite, yet extremely secretive. Same with the terrorists in this movie. Anyway, everything from the plot to characters were excellent. Even the music (by Jaidev) is extraordinary. Only the far-fetched bravado by Abhay Singh (Om Puri) seemed unreal, but then, it takes extraordinary courage and deeds to counter the 'cancer' of terrorism. In that respect, Abhay Singh's bravado also seems appropriate. As usual, Naseer puts the 'sher' in the character of Abbas Lodhi.I remember, I was in Bombay during the film festival in Dec. 1994. This powerful movie made me cry and repeat it the very next day. Thanks to Govind Nihalani, who personally let me in his special movie, I could enjoy to the full. No wonder I am his fan and Thank you Govind!If you are a Govind Nihalani or a Naseer or an Om Puri or a Amrish Puri fan, this movie is a MUST SEE.\n",

            "I had read somewhere that being in love with someone is a great thing because it makes you feel alive. Joggers Park confirms the statement. It is not about the Joggers' Park situated in Bandra West, Mumbai. It is about two joggers who come to know each other by meeting there and the life changes for both of them.There is an old Hindi movie song whose one stanza says - NA UMR KI SEEMA HO, NA JANM KA HO BANDHAN, JAB PYAR KARE KOI TO DEKHE KEWAL MANN (In love, there is no bar of age or birth as a lover sees only the heart of the beloved). And Joggers Park is a beautifully told saga which underscores this saying in a highly emphatic manner.A retired judge comes across a working girl, half his age in the Joggers Park. The girl is outspoken, lovely, confident and emotional. Interacting with her leads the aged man of principals who is a stern patriarch in his family, to have the feeling of the melting of the paraffin. A whole new world of emotions, interactions and social life opens before the aged gentleman who has never happened to see anything outside the court-room, the legal files and his traditional joint family. The girl, on the other hand, too gets more and more fascinated to the mature and benevolent nice person who sometimes becomes possessive towards her like a kid. However, ultimately both come to realise that this relationship, howsoever satisfying it might be, has not future and the society will not allow it to be made public. On the girl's side, the need of social security gets the better of her love and on the male's side, his responsibility towards his family overpowers his deep and delicate sentiments towards the girl. But the touchy last scene of the movie reminds the viewer that the thread of love cannot be broken by distance of the involving individuals.The débutant director late Mr. Anant Balani has done a terrific job. He has handled the sensitive and delicate theme of the movie with utmost maturity. The film has its flaws and lean patches, yet the overall impact of the movie upon a sensitive viewer is nothing short of a marvel. The biggest plus point, in my opinion, of the movie is that while treating the plot, the director has lent utmost respect to the central characters. Whether or not, you approve the relationship between the lead pair, you cannot help yourself respecting them. They are never short of dignity. The supporting cast has also been shown in respectful light and the story teller is very much correct in not exposing the scandalous affair and giving a different and highly mature end to the story.The characters are purely the flesh and blood human-beings. Nobody appears to be a fake character. Every main sequence of the movie has a human face. The human side of the two protagonists as well as the family members of the judge is revealed and emphasized with elegance. After all, loving somebody is not a sin and all emotional male-female relationships are not destined for the wedlock. But then, does this fact reduce the importance of the relationship or the sentiments involved ? No ! Declares the story teller. The relationship between the loving couple has been shown as purely platonic. They enjoy each-other's company, they respect each-other, they care for each-other and they strive to see and listen to each-other. But ! Nowhere is there any element of sensuality. And that shows the director's better sense and mature handling of a love story of a 65 years' old retired judge and a 32 years' old working girl.The musical score is pretty good though repeating the Adnan Saami song again and again in the background, irritates. The ghazal of Jagjeet Singh - Badi Najuk Hai Yeh Manzil is nothing short of a treat for the melody lovers. The cinematography is good. The loving couple is seen several times near the sea which (perhaps) symbolises the depth of their relationship. Other technical aspects are also upto the mark. The movie is lengthy but it is not a minus point because to portray the evolution of the relationship properly, the narrator needed time.The lead pair has delivered towering performances. Victor Banerjee has not done many Hindi films but he an actor of the genre of Nasiruddin Shah, Girish Karnad and Om Puri and since his early days of Shyam Benegal's Kalyug in 1981, he has seldom disappointed with his performance. The kid like feeling and behaviour of Justice J.P. Chatterjee who is in his sixties, has been excellently portrayed by him, giving the relevant scenes of the movie, an utterly human look. Perizaad Zorabian, on the other hand is not only pretty but a highly efficient actress who has portrayed the sentimental but daring and confident Jennie so well that it is difficult to imagine any other actress in that role. Among other cast which has got cameos only, Divya Dutta as the straight-talking and mirror showing daughter and Abha Dhuliya as the completely traditional and never suspecting her husband, devoted housewife are excellent.Why do we use the term - falling in love ? Falling itself is a negative term. In love, a person rises, not falls. Even when you are already committed, being in love with someone does not make you a sinner. After all, love just happens. It is not something deliberately attempted. The thing that constrains the expression and advancement of such feelings is called MARYAADA or the behavioural boundary-line associated to a person's status in the social life. Indian culture and the Indian social set-up put family honour and social repute of an individual on top of his priority list. And love is meant for sacrifice. Isn't it ? See Joggers Park and realise yourself.\n",

            "I'm reeling after watching \"Jalpari: the Desert Mermaid\"... easily one of the best films made this year in India. In the surface an adventure film with children characters in the centre, this movie goes deeper into exploring some of the most mature and relevant social issues in India more than most \"mature\" films can be credited for. Not a horror film in the traditional sense, this is one of the most frightening films I have seen in a while.The story is about a Delhi girl, 11-12 years old, who goes to visit her father's native village in Haryana during vacation. Her father is a doctor and building a new hospital near his village. An alien to these parts, she goes around exploring the area with her little brother and encounters situations that she does not fully understand. But her misadventures allow the mature audience to connect the dots... and come face to face with some of India's most deep-rooted epidemics like superstition, extreme gender bias and female foeticide. The audience is never preached about this, nor made to face these head-on; only glimpses are shown, somewhere in the background, as the central character goes around trying to blend with the local gang of boys, observing the village's strange lack of water sources and comprehending the legend of the witch that lives in the ruins outside the village. As she immerses herself in a childlike spirit of adventure, only hints are thrown in random exchanges of dialogues, and you start to notice that talking about certain things is a taboo with the villagers, the strange looks the girl child wearing jeans draws from people in the background, and there does not seem to be any other girl child of her age out in the streets. It's this invisibility of things that builds up the horror. It's those words of reproach never spoken, but communicated through unblinking eyes. Nobody dares to be rude to the daughter of the big city doctor, but the hints are thrown in endless references. \"Girls should be like girls\" is repeated at least twenty times; mostly disguised as a light- hearted jape. The wife of the neighbour is a Bengali girl, who someone refers to as \"imported wife\" in a hushed tone. First you learn the witch eats children, then it is revealed she eats only girl children. For one day the central character wears a salwar (after a lot of protests), and next day the local boys start behaving differently with her.At one point the theme grows so intense that you realise that the scariest scenes are not the ones where the ignorant city girl walks into the witch's house to look around. It's when she wanders the streets of the village. United in its biases, the village becomes a hostile entity, forever a threat to the girl for whom freedom of expression comes naturally. The extent of this threat is conveyed in a chilling way through a one-line realisation of the girl, \"If my father had not left this place, maybe I wouldn't even be here.\"The climactic moments, too, stand out in a major way. Not action packed or filled with game-changing revelations, they just make your worst fears come true. And these fears are not expressed through the witch, or any person, but the things you come across. The makeshift hospital with a computer and rusted ultrasound equipment. And the large pond filled with disposed corpses of baby girls. The ugliest face of the biases held dear by the patriarchal Indian society beating the drums of culture and tradition. That this horror does not fade away even after this film ends is made clear with an elderly person's emphatic assertion, \"This is way things work here, and it's going to stay this way.\"Hats off to the director, Nila Madhab Panda. And Lehar Khan, for bringing to life the endearing central character who would never stop asking questions and breaching boundaries. Shot in Mahendragarh, a district with one of the lowest sex ratios in India, this film allows you no escape from the plague that haunts our country. Worth watching again and again.

Though many of the friends reading this, might like to think differently but as I felt it can easily be termed as the worst movie of the year with not even one marginally entertaining scene in the film right till its climax.Based on a story revolving around the one night experiences of an innocent boy in Mumbai, the film straight away reminded me of Ketan Mehta's \"Oh Darling Yeh Hai India\", which also gave me the same kind of tough time in the theater, many years ago. In fact, the first scene of the film only (introducing Pratiek as a confused boy), gives you a strong indication of a badly made deliberate comedy, since Pratiek completely fails to generate the Chaplin kind of impact in his weak portrayal of the Tramp.And as the film progresses, it goes on from extreme to another teasing the viewer continuously with its highly absurd kind of content and sadly it all stops only when it ends. Directed by Raaghav Dar in a questionable manner, the film follows a bizarre sort of script which has not got 'entertainment' written anywhere in its pages. Moreover the actors too, tend to go over the top repeatedly as if they are really putting up a very good show for the audience. Particularly Pratiek should try to forget this movie as soon as possible to keep his confidence intact and same can also be said for the rest of the cast.Frankly while watching the film, I had only one thought in mind that how come not even one person from the team involved in its pre or post production process, couldn't guess that they all were actually working on such a waste. Or else its again the case where the project has been made only to show some Big Losses in the account books of the producers in the year end.In short, just don't get fooled by the two big names, UTV and Sanjay Leela Bhansali written on its posters at all, as this is simply not worth watching, even if you have got some spare hours after your train or fight has got delayed.\n",

Elements of Romeo and Juliet, the thought that \"the fault is not in the stars but in ourselves\" and other Shakespearean themes perfuse the story(ies). But as Goethe said, \"Everything's been thought of before; the trouble is to think of it again.\" Whether the thoughts first came in Indian literature or Shakespeare is irrelevant.It's sometimes difficult for me to get into a film when I'm at a low energy level, but this film's energy buoyed me right along.

These people are either blind and deaf or this is the first movie they are watching in their life. It is not that this is the worst movie made ever, but such thrash coming from the people who has given movie like \"Gupt\" is really saddening. The base of the movie is adult comedy, stupid sense of humor, and making fun of a dead body. A rich businessman dies, but because his family needs his wealth they are showing the world outside that he is still alive, by moving his dead body around. Meanwhile, for some or the other reason they are also cutting different parts from the dead body. Also at each day one of the other family friend is getting killed by this family, and again they have to move the dead body as it is alive and show it to the world. Also, while achieving this horrendous task, the family also finds out the shady truths about their family members. These truths vary from woman having affair with another man, man having affair with man, and also the children finding out that their real father is different, and for that they are being proud to moms. The bad thing about the movie is the movie has some great actors of current era like Paresh Rawal, and Om Puri. Having such great actors in such kind of movies is very saddening, as it makes to think us what is that which makes actors signing movie. I have rated this movie 1/10 as this is the least vote I can give. Unfortunately IMDb does not support negative ranking. This movie is the greatest insult to the Indian culture and family values. Its not that the movie with such subjects should always be bad, but then the dialogs, the scenes, the characters, and overall presentation is very very bad. They say that you will die laughing, but at the end you may want to suicide with shame.\n",

            "A totally unoriginal debut by fed-up editor Subhash Sehgal. Sunny Deol and Apoorva Agnihotri play two brothers who are orphans (a cliche in the melodramatic world of Bollywood!). Sunny Deol has never looked at another girl before (strange, as he is in his thirties!) and has always been working very hard to bring up his younger brother. Apoorva is a college boy who meets college girl Mahima Choudhry. They both fall in love in one day! Predictably, Sunny Deol also falls in love with Mahima. Cue heartbreak, overdramatic declarations of love and choppy editing. Mahima marries Apoorva and they sing some songs. In a strange twist, Mahima ends up married to both men!Direction is poor. The music is above average. The best song is 'Yaad Piya Ki Aane Lagi', which is ruined by a rubbish dance sequence. Sunny Deol seems embarrassed to play a romantic elder brother. Apoorva cannot act at all and fails at his attempts to do comedy. Mahima is a good actress but she has a bad hair day here. Her costumes are cheap and awful and her make-up is overloaded. Definitely not one of Mahima's best films (go and see Daag and Dil Kya Kare instead).Film rating: 4.5 out of 10\n",

            "On one level, Khoon Pasina is an action-packed revenge saga with knockabout violence, some shoddy production values and (in the case of the abbreviated DVD) a rather incoherent narrative. It is also a fashion House of Horrors. Flared trousers of truly epic proportions are paired with some of the most ghastly clothes ever created. Even at a distance of 30 years and a continent or two, it's hard not to cringe at Vinod Khanna's wet-look leather two piece with leopard skin trim. On another level, the film is alive with contradictions :· the opening voice-over expresses patriotic sentiment - but this is a state that completely fails to protect its citizens from the deprivations of criminals; · a schoolteacher tells his pupils they are to become the lawyers, doctors, farmers etc. of the future. But the film's heroes are men who talk with their fists, lack any kind of regular employment and dispense vigilante justice with impunity; · we are led to admire the courage of those villagers who face down an armed thug but when one of the heroes lets a tiger out of its cage in the middle of a crowd (to impress a girl) we are supposed to view it as just jolly good fun; · loving ones mother is one thing - but trying to beat up your wife is not an acceptable way of proving it; · we are invited to deplore contractors who exploit their workers but when one of the heroes destroys a farm in pursuit of a criminal gang, there is no suggestion that he ought to apologise or compensate the owners. On the acting front, the less said the better. Stacey Keach lookalike, Vinod Khanna, considers himself to be dead since losing his boyhood friend. His acting accords strongly with his self-perception - except during the action sequences which are wildly implausible. You watch Amitabh Bachchan with morbid fascination. It's not the acting, it's those appalling clothes. Rekha cannot help but look gorgeous but has too little to do. Mercifully, by wearing traditional clothes, she is spared the worst sartorial excesses of her co-stars. Despite all the above, I still found Khoon Pasina fun to watch and the moment when the two protagonists discover each other's true identity is a classic (albeit of a familiar kind).\n",

            "Ray throughout his career created films with a great human warmth that sometimes bordered on sentimentality (e.g., the Apu Trilogy, Two Daughters, Charulata). Others of his films seemed to me a bit dry and clinical, anthropological rather than deeply felt (e.g., The Middleman, Distant Thunder). And other works are just embarrassing failures (e.g., his adaptation of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People.) By coincidence, I saw Sadgati at the same festival and on the same day as Enemy of the People, and thus witnessed within hours the very worst and the very best of Ray. As for Sadgati, I don't know how to overpraise it. Made for TV, it is a brutally ironic condemnation of the Indian caste system and, by extension, all inequality and injustice. It has the concentrated power of a story from Russian literature. (Tolstoy would have loved it.) The cruel directness of this work displays an unexpected aspect of Ray's genius. The scenes in which Om Puri struggles to work for the disgustingly lazy Brahmin are almost unbearably painful. The scream that the late Smita Patil gives when she is told the tragic fate of her husband I will remember all my life. The final scene takes the story's irony to its logical, devastating conclusion. It's a matter of great regret that this work is not available on video: if it were, Ray's reputation would be even higher than it is.\n",

            "In the year 1982 Amitabh had 6 releases among which some were mass appealing films like Namak Halaal, Desh Premee,Khuddaar and SPS while some were sort of serious films like Shakti, Bemisaal. Bemisaal was directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee with whom he worked earlier in Anand, Namak Haraam, Mili, Chupke Chupke, Alaap and Jurmana. Bemisaal also has Amitabh in a dual role(3rd time that year) after SPS and Desh Premee. The film is a remake of Uttam Kumar's Bengali classic Ami Se O Shakha (1975). BEMISAAL is a departure from Amitabh's usual films. It starts off just like Namak Haraam, Anand(characters are shown in their later age and then flashback) and what for first seems like a love triangle changes into a psychological drama where AB has some inner demons, his revenge angle with Ruby Dutt is also well conceived, At times we are left perplexed by his behaviour which changes throughout but that also makes this film challenging and perhaps was not understood by audiences in 1982. The film has several subplots and at times does take time to understand, the end is superb too The film is well handled by Hrishikesh Mukherjee Music by RD Burman is again a highlight just like their earlier collaborations(Mostly hit songs) Ae Ri Pawan by Lata is simply outstanding, while Ek Roz by Kishore Kumar is fab, Khafa Hun again by Kishore is superb(Kishore was the voice for Big B in 70s and 80s), Yeh Kashmir Hai by Kishore, Suresh Wadkar and Lata is superb tooAmitabh Bachchan is superb in a role that is a departure from his usual kinda roles, he is awesome as Sudhir and also as Adhir(though only 1 scene). His expressions are simply fab Vinod Mehra plays his role well, In the same year he paired with Big B again in Khudaar and the role is somewhat similar. Raakhee is good in her role Om Shivpuri is good in a brief role, Aruna Irani leaves a mark, Deven Verma is funny in his role while Sheetal as Ruby Dutt is good rest are okay.\n",

            "'Amit Sahni Ki List' is a decent rom-com, that delivers an innovative storyline along-with some light moments & a superb performance by its lead-actor, Vir Das. Though it surrenders to beaten to death clichés in the final act, it still manages to bring a smile on your face. 'Amit Sahni Ki List' Synopsis: An investment banker makes a list in order to find his dream girl. Chaos erupts when he's confused between two women. 'Amit Sahni Ki List' has an entertaining first-hour, where the protagonist's journey in order to find his ideal women, gives us a few genuine comedic gems. Also, the supporting characters are nicely written, particularly the protagonist's buddy (Played by An Excellent Kavi Shastri), who brings the house down with some really funny lines. However, The final act is a stinker, giving in to clichés & predictability. This segment of an otherwise breezy film, certainly disappoints! The Screenplay is pretty fine, until it slips into predictability. Ajay Bhuyan's Direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, lack quality. Music by Various Artists is average.Performance-Wise: Vir Das is the soul of 'Amit Sahni Ki List'. He's likable & believable all through. Vega Tamotia is effortlessly seductive, while Anindita Nayar flaunts true confidence. On the whole, 'Amit Sahni Ki List' sums up as a good one-time watch.\n",

            "Watching a project such as AZAAN makes me sad because it is a perfect example of a misguided venture backed by a strong resourceful will of making a good film. It can easily be compared to a game wherein a person is holding a bunch of darts ready to hit the target-board. But after he throws them all, he finds out that where some less important ones have rightly hit the bull's eye, the other most important ones have gone far away from the main circle.Explaining the example given above, AZAAN has few great merits which should have essentially resulted in a fine movie. Like, it was marketed well and talks about a fresh subject of Bio-terrorism (spreading germs or viruses to kill a large number of people) which has never been exploited by any Hindi Film before so prominently. As required by the international plot it gets full support from its fabulous cinematography, brilliantly capturing the action sequences as well as its various world locations taking the viewer onto a multiple country tour. Plus it gets a very well composed & arranged background score which adds to the thriller aspect of the film perfectly along with few pretty decent tracks in its soundtrack like \"Bismillah\" and more.But all these merits become worthless in absence of the right kind of script, pace and performances required for such a project. In other words everything goes wrong in the film apart from these few points, sadly resulting in a poor show altogether. The director Prashant Chadha takes all his inspiration from the famous \"BOURNE series\" and other films made on the similar subject, but is not able to bring the same kind of excitement in his own film. The script goes on unimpressively, from being predictable to complicated travelling from one continent to another in fast cuts. Moreover the writers don't ever care to explain the concept of Bio-terrorism to the audience and take everything for granted. The romance factor looks like deliberately added as usual and the thrilling element is surprisingly completely missing in the film based on Global Terrorism.In the performance department, Sachin Joshi has got the looks but he actually doesn't match the vast scale of the project. He still needs to sharpen many aspects of his acting including his dialogue delivery. From rest of the cast Ravi Kissen tries hard but everyone else gets nothing written for them specifically in its weak script.On the whole AZAAN unarguably shows all the big money spent and many sincere efforts put in to convert it into a big success. But unfortunately its just like the case of constructing a fine smooth road towards a wrong direction. And it really makes you feel sad watching such an effort being made without any proper directions.\n",

            "In my part of the UK, Asian films are often shown at night. I usually avoid them since I'm usually not interested in watching their movies. They seem to have too much singing and simplistic storylines. Last night, however, I was enthralled by my first true Asian movie experience.The main character in Babu is a fairly poor guy who wants to marry a rich guy's daughter, Chanii. However, the rich father is not impressed and demands that the main character (I forget his name) must earn 100,000,000 rupees within a year, and only then will he let him marry his daughter.A chance encounter ends up with the overly honest main character accidentally picking up the wrong suitcase on his way home, and suddenly he is blessed with 1,000,000 rupees. His honesty makes him go to the police station to hand it in, but there he is faced by dishonest policemen who only want to take the money for themselves.Him and his friend, Happy Singh, start to think about how they could make 100 million rupees from just 1 million. They enlist a scientist who has a secret recipe for tea.. and start to sell their own brand of tea.After the first week, however, they have only sold two packets because their tea is too expensive. Happy Singh suggests that they start their own tea company and leases a house, a large field of tea, and some workers.. on the main character's behalf.Without giving anything away, the rest of the story revolves around the activities of the main character, Happy Singh, the workers and the house maid known as 'Ms. Break-All'.. because she breaks everything she touches.A nice film, which makes a great introduction to Asian cinema. Not too much singing, excellent characters, a good story (if a little clichéd).. good stuff.\n",

Janasheen has a flaw in screenplay otherwise it has the best performance by Mr. Feroz Khan, a great camerawork especially in the motor bike race scene which has been seen first time on the Hindi Cinema and Sr. Khan has one more feather in his cap of presenting the Car Race scene way back in \"Apradh\" (1972). Beautiful Locales which he captured almost all around the world. Fardeen and Celina were good and Johnny Lever was okay. Actions were great, \"Matrix\" kind of thing.

            "Hatya is a remake of the Malayalam thriller Poovinu Puthiya Poonthennal, which spawned several remakes in different languages, including a fantastic Telugu version Pasivadi Pranam starring Chiranjeevi, which is my favourite. Hatya is a scene-by-scene replicate of the other versions, and it is not up to the level of the Telugu film, which really is a rare thriller in how affecting and chilling it is. Hatya adds up several new elements, including some randomly infused moments of high melodrama, some nice but a little redundant songs, and other such ingredients that would meet the standards of a Hindi fare of the times and probably the requirements of a fixed audience as well. This is not to say the original versions lacked all of this, but Hatya takes a good few steps down in this regard as it places emphasis on the emotional side than the actual suspense.Now don't get me wrong, I'm fond of Govinda - he is one of the most energetic and charismatic actors I can think of. He's young and vibrant here, and does well enough even if honestly I preferred Chiranjeevi's excellent performance. The starlet of yore, Neelam, is as beautiful and gentle as she always was. Like all the other five versions, the film actually recasts two actors from the original - Sujitha, who plays the little precocious deaf-mute boy, who does a good job although clearly the material is too familiar to this child actor, and Babu Antony, who is equally as scary as he was in other versions in the role of the villainous hired killer. Anupam Kher is also here in a pretty common negative role he started doing around that time, and there other familiar faces like Raj Kiran, among others. The music by Bappi Lahiri is quite good, but often redundant.For Hindi film buffs, this is a nice go since the familiarity of the cast, the language obviously, and the narrative style is easier to digest. Other than that, personally I was much more impressed with the Telugu version (and I don't usually watch many regional Indian films, frankly speaking), which I had the pleasure to come across.\n",

            "Ideally a smaller project with no big names should have such a solid content with some surprising novelty that it forces the viewers to take a strong notice of it as the word of mouth spreads post its limited release. In fact that's the only way of making it big for independent films, particularly for the debutant producers, directors and actors apart from the other tried and tested formula of having a hit soundtrack, which is another hard to find feature in the present times. Hence its always exciting to watch all the lesser known, small budget films looking for that exclusive, innovative content breaking the routine pattern. But sadly, a big disappointment is what they have to offer most of the times with all seen before stuff, strangely tried without any major names in the cast pointing towards the immature outlook of the entire team behind their making.Incidentally, the present MAIN AUR MR. RIIGHT is also one of those poor films made on the ages old concept of a boyfriend/fiancé/husband hired by a successful lady for her own reasons for a specific period of time. And here we have Shenaz hiring a wannabe struggler actor (a Salman Khan fan again) as her Mr. Right for a few weeks in order to answer her group of friends asking her to marry or get engaged at the earliest. Now either the debutant director really had something else in his mind or on paper that couldn't get transformed on the screen as per his own visualization or he and his writers are perhaps still stuck in the same old formula of \"a hiring turning into an eternal romance\" used umpteen times before in our Hindi Cinema.As a result, what we get to see is a completely immature and uninteresting film in those two hours, that can easily be called a quite childish (or rather funny) take on love, romance and changing relationships between few long time friends. It begins on a comic note with all fresh faces showing some promise, but then quickly falls flat once its clichéd plot gets revealed turning it into a completely predictable and boring fare post the initial 20 minutes. Though the film is more about Shenaz looking stunning in her well chosen costumes right till the end, but the girl is nowhere close to the fairly enjoyable act of Barun Sobti playing the hired Mr. Right with a typical Punjabi feel and some good comic timing. So where Shenaz fails to impress due to her badly written character, Barun tries his best to deliver the only good moments in the film along with the other actors who probably are just their due to their personal contacts with the makers or straight taken from their ongoing short term courses in a known acting school.With a tacky editing, average cinematography and a filler background score MAIN AUR MR. RIGHT has only one above average feature in its favour and that's a well composed and sung track \"Bhool Na Jaana Mujhe\" in an unplugged style from Astitva Band. The soundtrack also has a version of famous song \"Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re\"(SAAHEB) from the man Bappi Lahiri himself and few other noticeable songs such as\"Khuda Khair\" and \"Desi Daru\" trying hard to contribute something into this avoidable venture.In short, this is another example teaching an important lesson to the budding producers, directors and actors, that unless a low budget, smaller venture has something fresh or novel to offer, it can be nothing more than a ignorable, wasted effort or may be a producer's own means to show some losses in a financial year.\n",

            "Hindi remakes of our regional cinema have always been there since decades and the idea has mostly worked whenever incorporated with some apt additions and much needed changes as per the Hindi speaking audience. Hence, before going into this particular direction, it is to be essentially understood that India is like a sum of many different regions, cultures and mindsets having their own lovable traditions and humour too. So a joke which might work in Bengal or Tamilnadu, may fall completely flat in MP, UP, Delhi or Punjab and the other parts of the country in all possibilities.Therefore an almost scene to scene remake with just the translations made is not the right procedure to be followed and the director has to re-write the original script with all the major changes required keeping in mind his exact target audience and its key region. Unfortunately in his latest comic venture, veteran director Satish Kaushiksimply ignores and skips this most important step of making a remake and thus fails hugely in his attempt to deliver an enjoyable entertainer to the viewers. Moreover even the changes made to convert it in a Mumbai kind of film also prove to be a big downer, resulting in a quite weak product as per director's own set standards in the past. An official remake of Bengali hit BHOOTER BHABISHYAT (2012) directed by Anik Dutta, the film is supposedly a horror comedy which is neither spooky nor comic with almost 'none' entertaining moments in its 2 hours of badly written stuff performed by many known names.It begins well but then takes too much time to come to the point (almost 20-25 minutes), before introducing the entire cast. Its basic plot talking about a joint home for a group of ghosts coming from various regions and time periods is surely interesting enough with a great potential to exploit. But the poor writing simply ruins everything and the silly adaptation even becomes unbearable in its second hour with too many forced in sequences and below average songs. Moreover the climax unimpressively tries to bring in the satire element too in vain, pointing towards the construction mafia operating in the major cities.In the performance section, the entire cast ensemble including names such as Anupam Kher, Saurabh Shukla, Jackie Shroff, Chunkey Pandey, Yashpal Sharma, Rajpal Yadav, Rajesh Khattar, J. Brandon Hill, Vijay Verma and Meera Chopra utterly fail to deliver any kind of enjoyable act and the only two actors who do manage to leave some kind of impact remain Parambrata Chatterjee (also there in the original too) and Sharman Joshi. Taking about its comedy, the single joke which actually works comes from the veteran Asrani saying, \"Main To Gareeb Aadmi Hun\" in a hilariously helpless mode repeatedly. Mahie Gill tries hard to generate some laughter with her old time dialogue delivery style but she strangely gets only a few scenes in the film, contrary to what was being promoted in its promotional campaign. The camera-work doesn't add anything special in the film's mediocre treatment and the same can be said about its background score or art direction too coming up with nothing above the routine.In all, this is a perfect example of how poor writing can make a complete mess of a fine, novel plot and also a film which clearly indicates that a remake should not be made just as a mere translation of the original taking the easy path (& avoiding all the re-working required essentially). On a concluding note, only a few weeks before we saw TOTAL SIYAPAA being rejected due to the same mistake made and now its GANG OF GHOSTS also strongly proving the point once again.\n",

This is unfortunate cause the movie is very good. Produced by Mehmood's brother Anwar Ali and directed by Lekh Tandon with a classic score by Rajesh Roshan this movie has songs by Kishore Kumar, Lata, Amit Kumar. All the songs are classics like Angrezi Mein Kehte Hain Ke I Love You, Mach Gaya Shor, Disco 82, Oonche Neeche Raaste, Hatja Baju and Maa Ka Pyar (not in the movie).

            "Last month, we saw Raavan by Mani Ratnam in which the character in the title role was (perhaps) a naxlite. However that movie was neither realistic nor very impressive. The last good movie upon this ever burning issue of rural India was Lal Salaam (2002) starring Nandita Das and Sharad Kapoor. Now after eight long years, a movie has come upon this topic which is truly a movie with a soul. This highly admirable movie is miles ahead of the over-hyped hollow movies like Raajneeti and Raavan.The story revolves around a poor tiffin-supplier in rural Andhra Pradesh, Narsimha (Suneel Shetty) who just wants to earn some additional bucks to support his family consisting of his wife Uma (Bhagyashree) and two children. However destiny drags him into the naxlite group led by Velu Anna (Aashish Vidyarthi), the mastermind behind the group being Krishnaraj (Vinod Khanna). Despite playing an active role in their adventures, he is never with them by heart. Being always concerned for the welfare of not only his own family but also hundreds of innocents being killed, he ultimately succeeds in redeeming himself of the shackles of the naxlite activities but not without the wounds leaving permanent scars on his tender and sensitive heart.Director Anant Mahadevan has given us many third class movies during the past few years. Now, after a long wait, he has come up with an outstanding movie. It is said that behind every successful man, there is a woman. The woman behind this success of his is Aruna Raje, inarguably one of the most talented lady directors of Indian cinema. She has written a highly sensitive and utterly realistic script which Anant has ably directed. The grip of the narrative upon the viewer is nowhere loosened. The viewer just keeps on watching for around two hours, holding his breath. This movie is nothing less than an edge of the seat thriller.The narrator has presented the side of both the conflicting groups, that is, the government and the naxlites, quite honestly, impartially and frankly. He has presented a very pertinent question though the hunger and the injustice lead the poor villagers to take the path of bullet and they are correct in their own right, yet what's the use of winning the battles and losing the war. Yes, there is difference between terrorism and revolution but should this revolution be allowed to last for decades and centuries without any hope of the ultimate victory ? The first pre-requisite of a worthwhile and well-justified revolution is the clear-cut aim behind it. When the aim itself is not clear, just running a parallel government type organization in the name of revolution is nothing but deceiving yourself and others who have faith in you.The narrator has exposed the hypocrisy of the self-acclaimed revolutionary leaders too, always talking big and preaching ideals but totally indifferent, selfish and inhuman when dealing with the individuals working for them. The attitude of Aashish Vidyarthi towards Suneel Shetty reflects the huge difference between what these so-called revolutionary leaders publicise as their deeds and what they actually do.Like Priyamani was shown as raped by the policemen in the police station in Raavan, Sameera Reddy has been shown as raped by the same uniformed people in the same venue in this movie. And this is the bitter truth of rural (even urban) India which again forces me to think why the Indian police stations are rape stations ? What is this strange trait of the police or military uniform which arouses the beast in the wearing male, turning him into the predator, ever ready to pounce upon its poor prey, that is, the female ? Any answers ? Many scenes of this movie are reminiscent of Maachis (1996), the controversial movie of Gulzar. I had a very strong feeling of deja vu when I saw one of the main characters of Maachis, Suneel Sinha in a similar role and even with the ditto get-up in this movie.The performances are all up to the mark though the screenplay has not done justice to certain actors like Nasiruddin Shah, Gulshan Grover and Bhagyashree.Whatever might have been theopinion of the viewers (and reviewers) about Suneel Shetty, I have always kept him in high esteem as an actor since J.P. Dutta's Border (1997). This is his career best performance and he deserves an award.He is so natural that throughout the movie I was feeling as I were him, the protagonist, running for his life and concerned every moment for the welfare of his wife and children and sensitive towards the life and well-being of every innocent, willingly or unwillingly involved in this avoidable havoc.Among others, I specially mention Sameera Reddy who has demonstrated that she can act brilliantly when handled by an able director in a strong role.The background score, the cinematography, the editing and other relevant aspects are all up to the standards. The story (based upon a true story) has been picturized in the backdrop of Andhra Pradesh and the writer-director duo have exasperated the contemporary Andhrite environment in the movie quite efficiently.This movie is just superb and gives a priceless message in the end in the words of Omar Bin Laden (given by him to his father, Osama Bin Laden) - find another way (other than violence). It must be existing. The only thing you need is to admit its existence and then look for it.\n",

Just simple depiction captured on film to move the audience. The performers were so natural in their portrayal of the characters and effectively communicated & shared their feelings/ emotions/ attitudes with the audience. An exceptional artistic endeavour!\n",

            "I had been longing to watch this movie for several reasons. One - it was from Shashi Kapoor (noted for sensible productions like Junoon, Kalyug, 36 Chowringhee Lane, Vijeta etc). Two - Girish Karnad helming the affairs who is quite able in his own right. Three - the songs which I literally grew up with (watching over and again in Chitrhaar, and cursing!). Four - the original choice for the lead pair was Amitabh & Rekha which transformed into a lacklustre Shekhar Suman & Rekha. Nonetheless, its \"Utsav - Celebration of art\" and it truly lived up to the expectations. Noteworthy is that everything in the movie was classified as an art including robbery & sex.As mentioned earlier, music was one of the strong motivations to watch the movie and needless to say the songs are top- notch. Its noteworthy to mention that Lakshmikant-Pyarelal were in top form (a la Himesh Reshamiyya) when Utsav was released and the music of Utsav was completely different to their genre and yes, a bit hit. Lyrics by Vasant Dev are exceptional. Probably after Satyam Shivam Sundaram, one gets to hear such poetry in its purest form.The only shortcoming was was language which I felt that there was enough room to improvise as it did not maintain consistency. In Hindi cinema after Navrang, perhaps one get to hear such pure dialogues and lyrics. The sets are massive and attempt to create the Gupta age is noteworthy.Vasantsena - nobody except Rekha.Samsthanak - the character per se was a mockery and needless to say ill- suited Shashi Kapoor.Annu Kapoor, Satish Kaushik, Harish Patel, Khulbushan Kharbanda, Gopi Desai, Anupam Kher entire NFDC was present except the biggies Naseer, Om Puri & Shabana.It was good to see innocent Master Manjunath. Reminded me of Malgudi Days.Neena Gupta suited the fiery Mandolika. Anuradha Patel was quite pretty and well suited for the role of Aditi. Amjad Khan was passable. Shekhar Suman was the weakest link. How on earth did me manage to lead a lead role opposite Rekha - beats me!\n",

            "The chemistry between Nargis and Rajkummar is unconvincing. While easily Rajkummar pulls off his role as a cop who is torn between his love and his work, Nargis doesn't bring much to the table. The music is typical Punjabi pop mixed with some folk, but doesn't add much value. The film tries to juggle the entertaining angle with a social cause which doesn't work.With a guessable plot and a meandering story line, attending these '5 weddings' proves to be a daunting task.\n",

            "After more than 15 years, Hema Malini returns to the director's chair (and she assumes a supporting role) to make 'Tell Me O Kkhuda' (what's with this double consonant?). This is also perhaps Esha Deol's comeback or departure film. The plot echoes one of Hema's previous directorial ventures 'Dil Aashna Hai' which itself was a remake of a Hollywood flick. It has nothing fresh to offer as it feels stale, like another family drama for the late 80s/ early 90s except that here the songs are dreadful and they look like awful MTV videos.Even the sequences that could have added some freshness, like the camel race, are poorly executed. The movie has a melodramatic tone. The plots regarding each of the dads are poorly developed, especially the last one (with Dharmendra and Hema Malini).Esha Deol had an authorbacked role but it's not a well written one. She is good in a few sequences, especially the scene where she eavesdrop on her biological father expressing regret, but her overall performance doesn't particularly impress. Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval are a delight to watch even with their limited screen time. Rishi Kapoor is passable. Meltem Cumbul is likable. Dharmendra really hams it up while Hema Malini is wooden. It was nice to see Madhoo after years but she doesn't get much scope nor does Arjan Bajwa.At least 'Dil Aashna Hai' offered good performances and has nostalgic value for me. As much as I like Hema Malini and respect what she's tried to do, 'Tell Me O Kkhuda' has nothing fresh to offer.\n",

A tad bit slow, but that slowness is a driving and important factor of the movie as a whole. The movie leaves you spellbound and asking questions. Manoj Bajpayee is so great when it comes to the smaller nuances and as useal delivers an over the top perfomance. Neeraj Kabi and Shahana Goswami add to the film the many undertones required.

Which doesn't sound entertaining when you write it - but it's actually quite fun because Anupam is a wonderful actor and the movie is about his thoughts, worries, delights, fears and insecurities.

            "B.R. Chopra's Kanoon is a damn good movie of its time. It is a murder mystery cum courtroom drama and is generally full of suspense which makes for a very effective and interesting watch. The concept is very well brought out on screen. Kanoon questions the righteousness of India's judicial system and shows the two faces of justice and law. There's a saying which says, \"It is easier to commit murder than to justify it\". This film only strengthens it. It is well scripted and narrated, and Chopra's direction is excellent. He pays attention to details and makes the viewer a silent and curious witness of the often-confusing proceedings. The film is often cited as the first Hindi film which has absolutely no songs. That was quite a refreshing change. It moves at a steady pace and is consistently tense and intriguing. The courtroom scenes are fascinating. That said, Kanoon is not flawless and it certainly could have been better. As I expected from Chopra, the ending is a bit sugarcoated, and the long speech in court did not make much sense to me. The cast, however, is roundly good. Ashok Kumar, who is according to me one of the finest actors to have ever appeared in Hindi cinema, is unsurprisingly excellent. He is at par with the best actors from Hollywood's golden era: classy, controlled, likable and restrained, always delivering nuanced, impressive and convincing performances. Rajendra Kumar is also very good though he is a bit over-the-top at times. Mehmood introduces another comic character which does not really go well with the proceedings, and this is another flaw. Nanda and Manmohan Krishna are both effective. But, the one who completely steals the show, and I think many would agree with me, is Nana Palsikar, in a performance that is heartfelt and moving. His character was the one I felt for the most, and due credit for this goes to the actor himself. He brilliantly captures his character's essence, which proves once again that poverty is the mother of all crimes. All said and done, Kanoon is a Hindi classic which is worth watching.\n",

What ensues is a crazy ride with many ups and downs and some serious laughs.I'm not the type of person who laughs aloud in movies, but this one had me in splits. Some of the characters are simply hilarious, while others seem to be in the movie just to increase the chaos.Don't expect logic in this movie. It's a loose script, but enjoyable. The movie could have done with some serious editing, especially towards the end, but no one would mind that.Definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoy the Hungama and Chup Chup Ke type of movies.\n",

            "The concept of incorporating more than one story in a movie running parallel to each other is not anything new to Bollywood. The trend which has been earlier tried in numerous famous projects gets repeated in Tum Milo To Sahi, but thankfully in a much better way. Moving ahead of many other movies made on the similar pattern, director Kabir Sadanand's latest venture has got something to say with many worth watching moments and a well directed climax.Revolving around 3 different love stories dealing with distinctive age groups, TMTS starts off calmly with the introduction of Dimple Kapadia as a Parsi lady running a coffee home and Nana Patekar as a 50 plus person desiring an extension in his job. Facing the refusal from his boss, Nana is forced to spend a retired life alone and gets a little eccentric due to that. But in reality it's his eccentric behavior on the screen which transforms the movie into a not to be missed experience and impresses. In straight words, TMTS completely belongs to Nana Patekar alone before the climax. Especially watch out for his scenes with the small kid and as a first time lawyer in the court. Although Nana's character is written on the similar lines of his own \"Prahaar\", but that doesn't take away any charm out of his superb act of a retired lawyer cum clerk in the movie. However in the last court room sequence, it's Dimple Kapadia who takes the final moment lead and brilliantly showcases her still unexplored hidden potential as a veteran.Both Nana Patekar & Dimple Kapadia are simply terrific in their scenes together. They convey a lot more through their expressive eyes and silence. The short and intelligent dialogues given to them post intermission, contribute greatly towards the inspiring impact of their individual acts. But sadly, the movie is not able to rise to the level of a masterpiece due to various reasons. The most important one being its editing, which needed to be more tight and crisp. There are several scenes in the first half which are quite slow and tend to drag. Particularly the plot around the young Rehan & Anjana is not engrossing enough. It only proves to be the usual stuff with nothing new to say, contradicting the other two interesting stories running simultaneously. Apart from that, the movie has many unwanted songs which all should have been avoided in the first place. Surprisingly it even has an item number featuring Tanisha (Kajol's sister) doing a very unexpected sexy kind of dance number. In fact it's only the title track, which sounds soothing to the ears and rightly provides the much needed musical support to the theme.Another noticeable merit of the movie is Vidya Maldave who looks stunning in the role of Suniel Shetty's wife and acts like an experienced master of the art. Her persona is both pleasant and hot, very similar to that of Madhuri Dixit, the still remembered queen of the gone era. Suniel Shetty as the husband caught in the dilemma struggles in the start but later delivers a controlled performance towards the end. The story featuring Suniel & Vidya deals with a very important & relevant question that, Is money and status symbol in the society more important than human relationships and family? Rehan Khan & Anjana Sukhani as the young couple of the third story are both pleasantly natural. But their story becomes the weakest part of the movie. The child playing the foreign returned kid is extremely confident. Among the rest, Mohnish Behl gives his usual kind of act and Raghav Sachar looks fresh in his small cameo. But couldn't figure out why Raghav repeatedly shows off his skills of playing various musical instruments in all his ventures. Sandesh Shandilya, as the music director comes up with a good title song but rest all lack the melody part in them. Cinematography is perfect which would be enjoyed more by the Mumbaikars and the people pretty familiar with Mumbai and its living style.Summing up, TMTS is director Kabir Sadanand's second project in which he surely proves himself miles ahead of his first movie. He undoubtedly has got the talent to handle a sensitive project. But I seriously wish he had chosen another basic plot, different than the one used in TMTS. The story of rich people trying to vacant an old house and capture it for their own modernized plans has already been used umpteen times before in Hindi Movies and has got no novelty left in it.Still the movie uses the plot in an entertaining way and the end result is worth watching for its three main performers namely, Nana Patekar, Dimple Kapadia and Vidya Maldave. So you should certainly give it a try!\n",

Unfortunately, Vasu has made an important enemy, and his future happiness, if not his life, is at stake.The best part of this melodrama is the light romance between Vasu and Payal. The main plot, which should be moving, is convoluted at times, and the acting not convincing. Even Karisma Kapoor does not display the enthusiasm and energy of her later movies. The songs are average, and the choreography unremarkable. Reema Lagoo's beauty and elegance shine through, but otherwise this is a mediocre movie that does well enough for a time-pass, but is not memorable in the long run.\n",

He also played a character in the film. What starts off as a young love story going sour due to racial and cultural differences gets into the very much known territory of love-triangle. If that is not enough there is lot of verbal exchange regarding upholding culture, values, traditions, duties, sacrifice et al. There is not even tongue-in-cheek humor to add some spice to the scenes. What times are you living in, dudes? What you get to see finally is same old, tried and tested romance of 1970s style, told umpteen times, with hardly any novelty in storyline and no style and substance in narrative. To top it film moves with a snail-paced, slow thakela tempo, loose ends with songs thrown in between without any context. I wonder how come maker thought that his audience still lives in that Stone Age? Both veteran Mr. Bachchan and Revathy tried to pull the drama with their strong performances. Both cinematographers shot both Sweden as well as Mauritius, remarkably well. Lead Actress Annabelle Walis not just looks fabulous but also acted well. 60% of talking part is in English, which is very apt in the situations, but this whole together does not salvage film from turning into a dull, vapid low energy drama. With so little in content and almost lack of conflict to carry the story forwards, and holds interest, these film tests the patience of audience.

If he's a psycho his mental disorders shows off only towards the end (while he behaves quite normal in the rest of the film). This is the patented, oft-repeated formula being used in every other suspense flick. A mayor (Jackie Shroff), an inspector (Sunil Shetty) and a painter (Dino) are in love with an architect (Karishma) at varying degrees. And then there's a serial killer on the move. But you have to choose the killer from the three men itself, as there are no other characters in the movie (So your search becomes much easier). And check the killer's modus operandi. He first whips the victim, then injects a sedative and finally stabs her. Also he leaves the needle and dagger next to her dead body as his trademark. Moreover, the killer has an underground den where he stuff's his prey's body in frozen pods. Only if these cotton-wool water bodies in neon lit chambers weren't so bizarre, the audience would have given a thought about getting scared. And it's not the least difficult to guess the killer's identity. A term called Editing is completely absent in this film, for every scene has been blown out of proportion, while some being plainly unnecessary. And the director's tendency to go overboard with the action scenes in the finale just leaves you with thoughts that when shall the Exit doors open. The noisy and screechy background score makes you realize the importance of silence.Final verdict: yeh filmmakers apni harkato se kab Baaz aayenge.\n",

            "There's enough realism in the script or at least in its loud inspiration to watch this comedy drama that speaks volumes about the backward mindset in rural India.Arjun (Rahul Bagga) is a loafer who is falling in love with Maya (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a young and beautiful woman married to the foul- mouthed, sexagenarian village chief, Sualaal (Annu Kapoor). Maya seeks shelter from Arjun and silently finds happiness in him, owing to Sualaal's inability to be a proper husband, with poor performance in bed and verbal as well as physical abuse. Naturally, when one day, Sualaal finds out about Arjun's illicit relation with his wife, he beats him up and publicly accuses him of raping his award-winning buffalo, named, for FIR purposes, Miss Tanakpur.The story is as wicked as it sounds, which the writers have credited to real-life happenings in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. How a backward system with enough corruption mixed into it treats its men based on ruthless bias is the central topic of the film. In rural areas like the one shown in the film, the powerful continuously oppress the powerless, even leading to countless fatalities, in some cases. Arjun's family has to go through a harrowing time once he is arrested: his sister's marriage is disavowed, his father tries to kill himself, and his mother slowly moves to the path of atheism. It is startling to watch the story, told in a rather clumsy way, unfold in front of your eyes when you know that something like this has happened, or at least, has the merit to happen in today's world.There is enough humor for an average Indian to perceive here. But, the B-grade shade the film has in its dialogues and slapstick may turn few off. People's blind faith on idol worshiping, graft among policemen, the judicial system - there's everything in here. Some very interesting sequences are gelled together to ignite emotions, driven by powerful performance by Kapoor. Sanjai Mishra and Om Puri are mostly seen fooling around. Bagga should brush up his blunt areas, and it was good to see Bhatt after a long time. Ravi Kishan as Sualaal's slavish helper is typecast.I had been stalling this watch for quite a long time, but it eventually proved worthwhile. A good afternoon watch.BOTTOM LINE: Vinod Kapri's \"Miss Tanakpur Hazir Ho\" is not a laugh riot, but it proves a point and chafes on the harsher realities of rural India through a comic container.

It could be viewed as a black comedy or as a dramady of the chawl culture and it can be seen as a parody of Bollywood films. Very enjoyable indeed. Manjrekar himself cleverly wrote the screenplay while Jha directs his first film. You'll be laughing a lot! As the title claims, the movie focuses on a chawl. It's sort of in the semi-documentary/semi-feature film format. Sushmita plays herself as the presenter of the documentary. Then there's another voice-over narrator. The film further focuses on the people living in the chawl. There's the hyper Ganpat (Vijay Raaj) who pretty much does nothing. There's a naive housewife Laxmi (Raveena Tandon) who's desperate to have a baby with her husband (Sanjay Navrekar), there's Mona, an aspiring actress (Namrata Shirodkar), Dulari (Divya Dutta) a working mother suffering a bad marriage with an alcoholic husband and a greedy mother-in-law, Suman (Rinke Khanna) a young tutor taking care of her traumatized father, Soundarya (Dia Mirza), an 'ugly' duckling who's rejected by every suitor, Sheela (Shweta Menon) a mother of two children and wife of an unemployed abusive husband and numerous other dwellers. While the main focus is on the lives of the women mentioned. We see them living their lives bravely and making the best out of them. In spite of their circumstances, the women are strong, hardworking, caring and they accept the way their life is. Then in contrast, we see most of the men who are lazy, waste their women's money on booze or anything else, beat their women, fool around etc. Yet, as I mentioned it is a satire and both men and women can easily enjoyed it. Everything is shown in good humour.Continuing with the plot, the owner of the chawl, Parvin Seth (Khedekar), wants to build a modern shopping complex and is desperate to take back the chawl. He tries to compromise with the inhabitants but in no way are they willing to leave. Seth makes different attempts (he even sends a hit-man) only to fail. Enters a researcher Aman Joshi (Aman Verma) and changes the life of the dwellers. They see new hope in him as he helps them with their difficulties. However, things aren't the way they seem.Jha directs the film brilliantly and skillfully spoofs it up without falling flat. The language is a little street and coarse (I think kids shouldn't watch this) definitely adds to the chawl lifestyle, the parody songs e.g. Chale Chalo (from Lagaan), Hum Bhi Hai Josh Mein (Josh) etc. are hilarious and fun to look at. The whole 'sati' sequence is another track that provides loads of laughter. I'll try not to say too much about the content as it's best if you discover the surprise by yourselves.All the performances are very good. To mention a few, Raveena Tandon is fantastic and plays her part with sheer ease in a very natural way (Mahima Chaudhry was the earlier choice for the part). Vijay Raaj, Aman Verma and Divya Dutta are excellent. Sanjay Navrekar is simply hilarious. Namrata Shirodkar does very well. Ditto for Rinke Khanna and Dia Mirza. This is probably Shweta Menon's best role to date and she does full justice to her part. Sushmita Sen shines with her contagious laughter. Sachin Khedekar is good.On a more serious note, the film does help us to appreciate the chawl dwellers. Known as middle class people, they are the hard workers, they're the ones who keep the country going, who vote, who suffer the most during conflicts e.g. political, they're the ones who sacrifice, they are strong, they are brave, and to say the least, they are survivors. Thanks to Jha and Manjrekar for making this film and giving us a relevant message through laughter.\n",

            "At last Indian cinema has started following the European art and plots. Excellent movie, entertaining and great actors. You will enjoy this movie even more if you are a Punjabi. This movie shows that how a small budget and excellent direction can result into a full entertainment. I cannot find any fault in this movie. But if you like bogus adult comedies than you may not like this movie because its only healthy comedy. Its a family movie so do not hesitate to take your elders to watch this movie. Om Puri and Shreyas have done extremely well. The story revolves around a mountain and three brothers. Its a completely different experience. Must watch.\n",

            "Majhdhaar is a story of friendship, innocence, love, relationships, and norms of Indian society. All of these above-mentioned elements are magnificently interwoven into a tragedy which is perfectly presented by the acting of Salman Khan and the direction of Esmayel Shroff.I acknowledge some technical errors, which were afflicted due to the delayed post-production of this film but still, this film is poorly rated and miserably criticized. If you have a heart and soul, and you can see the world with a different perception then you will enjoy this film as a perfect voyage of time. Believe me, I have seen this film more than 20 times, and every time, it makes me realize the importance of friendship, harmony, and love in my life. It challenges me to make good decisions and amends the misjudgments and misunderstandings.I was 10 years old when I watched this film for the very first time and from that moment on, I started to value the impact of friendships and memories in my life. Over the years, whenever I founded myself abandoned and demolished, I befriended Gopal (Salman Khan), he makes me laugh, he makes me cry, he taught me to be selfless, and positive towards life. He taught me to chase friends and emotions and kept aside materialism. He taught me to be vibrant about things in my life. Gopal was the teacher, who unravel the meaning of tragedy in my life and I recommended this film to my closed circle of friends and they really loved the ark of the story, the life lessons it has to unfold and the tragedy served in it.Salman Khan lived the character of Gopal perfectly. To me, It was his one of the vastly under-rated role and film. It deserves recognition or at least a cult status for his heartwarming performance. Honestly, tears burst from my eyes, in various scenes of this movie especially \"Gopal, Iss Duniya Mein, Lene Nahi Dene Aaya Hai Aur De Kar Jayega\". It was an all-round performance from him.Manisha Koirala, I adored her in the young days. She looks terrific, in the first portion of the film and acted brilliantly in the last portion of the film.Rahul Roy was miserable, he looked out of shape, his dialogue delivery terrible, yet he was saved from the heartwarming performance of Salman Khan. Rajeev Verma was typical as Indian Dad, though he delivered some wonderful advice. Raj Babar was a big surprise and I really loved his cameo as Mohan Babu.Music and background score is the soul of this film. Nadeem Sharavan has created a melody that will be timeless and purely aesthetic to the listeners. Aye Mere Dost Dosti ki Kasam is a wonderful tribute to the friendship, Humne Khamoshi se Tumhe and Saghar se Gehra Hai Pyar to Love and Taram Taram Taram Pa to fatherhood and Kya Zamaana Aagaya to Emotions and Main Iss Se Mohabbat Karta Ho to Fantasies and Bachke Meri Jaan to Awaara Gardi. The background score is purely aesthetic and It is my Mother, favorite musical album, she really loved these songs and we were grown up, listening to this album.Salim Khan has written a story, which is brilliant and has all the elements of reality and life. It narrates the impact of the perfect storm of time and life and how it hit the human emotions and relations and how they got destroyed and parted by it. Esmayel Shroff justified to it with the classical take on the story, he kept the things simple and triggered emotions with beautiful locations as the backdrop.It was released on 29th March 1996, just two days before when I stepped into this world. Maybe, that's why I build a connection and considered this a heartwarming tale of life and friendships.If you're reading this review, forget about the low votes and 3.5 rating, watch this film and explore different genres of life. I guarantee you, it will teach you some wonderful lessons about life, friendships, and human emotions.\n",

            "A taxi driver is dangerously obsessed by a horror movie actress. He travels to Cannes to convince her to star in the movie he fantasises he is going to direct. A series of killings start.On the face of it this is one of the many films from the early 80's slasher cycle. However, it's hardly typical of that genre. Sure, it has the usual slasher ingredients – lots of gory violence and lots of semi-nude girls – but overall the tone is quite different. There is a definite comic feel to this one. Much of that is down to lead actor Joe Spinell who plays the deranged taxi driver. Spinell is a good enough actor to make, what could easily be a very unlikable character, sympathetic. His interplay with his mother is also kind of funny and I suppose is a jokey take on the stereotypical mother-fixated psychopaths from these types of movies. Joe's delusional world view is illustrated with segments that blur fantasy and reality. We see him as a ludicrous tuxedoed famous director interspersed with the scenes of his grim reality. All of this stuff gives The Last Horror movie a definite difference from other movies with similar scenarios.The film also stars Caroline Munro as the famous scream queen. And she looks pretty striking with her black and white mane of hair. Interestingly she is making a movie called 'Scream' and this was way before Wes Craven came up with his post-modern slasher. In fact, you could argue that this very film was playing around with a few of the ideas that Craven would use over a decade later to great commercial success. After all, this is a film that playfully points out the conventions of the slasher film while still essentially delivering various methods of bloody murder. What was also pleasing was the way that The Last Horror film winds things up with a pretty decent ending that wasn't obvious. So, all in all, this has to be considered one of the more innovative slasher flicks of the 80's.\n",

            "Ghar ho to aisa is a powerful and shocking family drama. It tells the story of a selfish family with Father (Sayeed Jaferi), Mother (Bindu), Two Brothers (Anil Kapoor) and (Raj Kiran), Brothers wife (Depti Naval), One Sister and her Husband (Kader Khan) and kid. Anil, Kader, Kader's Son and Depti are the good hearted people in this film.It tells the storyline of Depti, who is the poor daughter in law and is treated absolutely bad. She gets tortured and beaten up by the evil mother in law Bindu, husband and sister. The sad thing about this, is that this kind of things happen for real. Many poor girls get married off and are treated like dirt, mainly because they cant go back to their mothers. This film demonstrates when Depti is forced to bring a big amount of money from her mother, otherwise she cant live in this house. Her mother is a servant, who lives alone in a almost damaged house as it is. There are many powerful and shocking stuff in this film. Its best if you see it for yourself.Anil gives yet another Great performance. Meenakshi is Fun in the second half as she teaches the family a lesson, Watching Depti makes you upset, she gives a good performance. Kader Khan provides comedy and is magnificent as the Ghar Jamai (Meaning, the Man who lives in his in Laws). Bindu delivers a superb performance as the mother in law from hell. Raj Kiran is always playing the same role of the evil member of the family. All Supprting cast do a good job.A Great Family Drama with Serious stuff and Fun in the second half.\n",

            "yeap, horror from India, or should we say thriller, since the murderscenes are not that explicit like in other movies. However, it is a refreshing thing: though there are still some songs, they are really part of the movie, without disturbing anything in the story.I definately don't agree with the other comment I read. It is realistic, and the outcome, if you REALLY were watching, was definately predictable. Maybe you will know for 50%, the other half is still a bit surprising, but as long as you don't fall asleep, you will know 'who did it'. It is not an unique story. You will find much alike in other horror movies, but don't we all repeat sometimes?The only problem I have with this movie is that a big part is filmed in a kind of Swiss village, only inhabited by Indians..... Regualry you have the feeling that you are walking through a 'one-street-only' village, where behind the facade of the houses you will only find empty space.Anyway, the actors are all doing great, new talents give their best, and all in all, I would say 7 out of 10.

However, the culprit can be guessed easily if someone can read lip movements which is no that hard here. I wish the director had taken some other camera angle. But if someone can't read that then this movie is interesting. But then don't have too much expectations. The film belongs to 90s era and the suspense is also for that era audience.One dragging point is that hero is sacred of dark so you can't expect him to investigate the mystery. He could have been shown as a complete actor but due to poor characterization, he looks only a chocolate boy. Songs are good.It is a one time watch if you don't have anything else to do.\n",

            "Despite 100 years of Indian cinema horror is sadly one of the most overlooked genres in Bollywood with most films on offer consisting of whatever forgetful or ridiculous plot line the Bhatts (during the 70s and 80s it used to be the Ramsays who were associated with the genre) have cooked up that week. Prawaal Raman's Dobaara: See Your Evil, an official remake of Mike Flanagan's acclaimed Oculus, is not any better than those. Incidentally, the film is part of a three-picture deal between Relativity Media, B&U Television Network, and Balaji Telefilms, which also includes remakes of the films The Best Of Me and 3 Days To Kill along with Oculus.Dobaara: See Your Evil is set in England and as the story goes Natasha Alex Merchant(Huma Qureshi) and Kabir Alex Merchant(Saqib Saleem ) are siblings who live a separated life due to a tragedy that has happened in the past. She recalls her childhood with her family with her father Alex Merchant (Adil Hussain) and her mother Lisa (Lisa Ray) and their pet Rambo. Things are hunky-dory till the father brings home a mirror which is said to be haunted. One fine day in a rage of fear, Adil shoots Lisa and in turn Saqib shoots Adil. Natasha strongly believes that it is the mirror which was responsible for all happenings. The brother-sister duo reunite after a decade to destroy the haunted mirror but the mirror is well prepared in advance and knows how to protect itself.The film is ineptly executed and the purpose of making the film remains unfathomable. The film is set in England, and has not a single Indian reference point that connects it with our experiences. No social or cultural adaptation has been attempted.Dobaara: See Your Evil does have an interesting first half however it is not at all scary as projected in the trailer. The performances by the lead actors make the film interesting however the film lacks engaging narration in some aspects. Some of the interesting episodes have been badly presented. One couldn't initially make out if Alex Merchant was possessed or schizophrenic. The post interval episodes convince you that the film is a psychological thriller.The second half of the film too has been loosely executed and will leave the audience confused. Many of the interesting episodes have been clearly ignored and the major plot has been sidelined. The performances by the lead actors drive the film completely. The pre-climax events make the film interesting and the climax is completely predictable.Writer-director Prawaal Raman fails to make Dobaara: See Your Evil into an interesting horror film as the film lacks scary content. In fact, Dobaara: See Your Evil can be called a thriller instead of a horror film. The story of the film is interesting and well written but Raman's screenplay looks loose while his dialogues are okay. Cinematography by Anuj Dhawan is a major asset of the film. Editing by Hakeem Azeez and Nipun Gupta is decent. Arko Pravo Mukherjee's music is okay. Baxkground score by Avedis Ohanian and Aditya Trivedi is effective but the decibel levels of the background score needed to checked at several places.Performance wise Adil Hussain has been exceptional in the film, almost flawless. Lisa Ray has been decent and apt for the role. Saqib Salem is impressive. Huma Qureshi is just about average. Madalina Bellariu is convincing as the spirit of the mirror, Anna. All the other actors do as required.On the whole, Dobaara: See Your Evil is dull, exhausting and just forgettable.\n",

            "Vidhaata is a very enjoyable Hindi movie of its time. Subhash Ghai gathers some of the greatest talents of those times, including Dilip Kumar, Shammi Kapoor, Sanjeev Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, and Amrish Puri. The story is quite an interesting one, and the development is very well brought out. The film does veer into formulaic caricature from time to time. Much of the action borders on the fantasy, but then it is well made up for by some intriguing twists. One scene between Amrish Puri and Dilip Kumar, which involves the explosion of a car, is greatly entertaining. Unfortunately the second half is marred by proceedings which are uncalled for. Similarly, the love story involved is not very convincing and contributed little to the story.The main high-point of this picture is unquestionably the acting. No one can ever doubt Dilip Kumar's extraordinary acting prowess, and in this film he turns in what I consider his best work of the decade (along with Shakti). He is tremendous as Shamsher, a simple working man who turns into a mafia don. This is one of the few Hindi movies where such a transformation is credible and, without question, due credit for this should go to the actor himself for his renowned ability to portray complex characters with rare, natural ease and realism. As his character adopts a new name and identity, he appears greatly stylish and sophisticated, but his immense love for his grandson and the pain over the loss of his son are utterly convincing. This is just another understated performance, which never fails to leave a lasting impact on the audience.The rest of the cast are there to support the screen legend in his author-backed role, and all do well. Sanjeev Kumar is unsurprisingly dependable in a small supporting role, and Amrish Puri is excellent in a villainous part which is slightly better than his usual parts of this sort. Sanjay Dutt makes a confident debut, and he is well paired with the beautiful Padmini Kolhapure, even if the two are the least impressive here. The one who almost, if not totally, manages to steal the show, however, is the wonderful Shammi Kapoor, whose well-etched comic part provides the main glimmer of relief in an otherwise heavy story. He is simply brilliant as Shamsher's age-long and loyal friend, soulfully portraying the wholesome, admirable kindness of the character and exuding warmth at all levels.Vidhaata is like many films of its kind but at the same time it is a cut above the usual fare presented at the time. In this sense, it is a very good film well worth seeing. Ultimately it is the acting, particularly by Dilip Kumar and Shammi Kapoor, which elevates it to an altogether different level and more than makes up for its flaws.\n",

            "Morning Raga stars Shabana Azmi as an accomplished Carnatic singer who does not sing anymore because she is still stricken by an old bus accident she got involved in on her way to a concert with her violinist and son, both of whom died. Since then she has never left her village and never sung a song. Now, the son of her violinist comes and asks her to sing a few songs with his musical group. That's when the story begins to take shape. I quite liked the story of the film. It was fresh and innovative and the film was made artistically and intelligently. The locations are beautiful, especially the village views shots, and are aided by effective cinematography.The film entirely belongs to Shabana Azmi, in a fantastic role that gives her scope to display both her dramatic talent and particularly her ability to play a very difficult character. Carnatic music is a serious thing, and Azmi had undergone a great deal of training for this part in order to understand how they sing, and to learn their body language and mannerisms when they sing. She did not sing the songs herself (well she's not a robot you know), but believe it or not, lip-syncing is very difficult in such songs because they are sung in twisted tones at lightening speed. Azmi played the character exceptionally well and was convincing both as a Carnatic singer and as a traumatised woman who is terrified to even think about going out of the village and stepping on the damned bridge on which the accident happened.I watched the film for Shabana Azmi, and she is the main reason I liked it. The rest of the cast is decent, and the entire concept of modern members of a rock band who want to make something special and collaborate with a Carnatic singer was interesting. The film is about music, the beauty of music, and the music of the film, from the songs to the background score, is outstanding. The first song Shabana sings with them is the best moment of the film. I liked the film for showing how contemporary youngsters appreciate old and traditional music. It is a pleasant and realistic film which beautifully portrays the lifestyle of rural and urban India, and then brings them together by creating an interaction between their people.\n",

After good movies like Pink, Naam Shabana and Judwaa 2, there was so much expectations from Taapsee Pannu. She was not in mood of acting thorugh out the movie or we can say that her role was written so badly by Aleya. Hawaa Hawaai fame Saqib Saleem is also not in good shape.

Title track by Tanishk Bagchi was not impressive one.Box-office: This movie will be flop for sure at Box-0ffice.

A well written fast pace thriller this film keeps you hooked from the start till its end.Each story has a certain gripping element along with a surprise ending that you never see coming. The stories include Flory(Renuka Shahane), a grieving mother and a businessman Vilas(Pulkit Samrat) looking for a kholi, Varsha(Masumeh Makhija), facing an abusive marriage and her ex-lover Shankar(Sharman Joshi) & Malini(Aisha Ahmed) and Suhail(Ankit Rathi) two youngsters deeply in love but separated by parental pressure with Leela(Richa Chadda) as the narrator.The characters share almost equal screen time with each of them giving admirable performances specially Renuka, Sharman and Masumeh. However the strength of the movie lays in its writing and the short run-time. The screenplay is written by Althea Dalmas Kaushal who in past has been a part of flops like 'Happy New Year' and 'Noor' and is brilliantly directed by Arjun Muherjee(making his debut).'3 Storeys' is a good example of how a film rapidly moving movie can be executed within a short time span.

            "\"Baabarr\" releasing without any pre release hype or heavy promotions, comes out to be a marginally decent watch in parts. Looking at the promos of this unknown movie, you find three known names featuring in it as Mithun Chakraborty, Om Puri and Sushant Singh. And refreshingly all three deliver worth watching performances, taking the movie to a much better level than expected.But annoyingly, \"Baabarr\" keeps on moving between two ends of quality and mediocrity constantly during its two hours of duration. At one end, it offers few sequences which are immensely impressive and well handled by the director Ashu Trikha, whereas on the other, it also has scenes which simply force you to just go for a break.The movie is highly violent and brutal showing a lot of bloodshed with numerous murders and shoot outs. Though it has some gripping moments and power packed performances in store, but sadly talks about the same gang war drama seen several times before on the screen. The script has nothing new to offer as it revolves around the rotten plot of a young boy growing in the surroundings of crime and becoming a big gangster in his youth, only to get killed by the police in a fake encounter. But it's the direction, action and cinematography in the movie which keeps on impressing the viewer at regular intervals of time throughout. Especially the original outdoor locations and the racy chase sequences shot beautifully by the DOP.The initial 20 minutes of the film, depicting the transformation of a young boy into a big gangster are undoubtedly the best moments of this intense crime drama. As you watch the first murder committed by the young \"Baabarr\", you feel like it's going to be a great explosive watch (as if an Indian \"City of God\"). However the director fails to maintain the electrifying pace generated by its superb opening, resulting in just an average product later on. In few words, \"Baabarr\" starts from a higher level and then slides down to the same old path, reducing the overall impact of the movie to a great extent.The best performance comes once again from the veteran actor, Om Puri, who skillfully delivers a polished act of a corrupt police officer with conviction. Mithun Da shines bright in the role of an encounter specialist SP. Sushant Singh as Baabarr's rival gangster is superb in his few scenes. The debutant Sohum Shah playing Baabarr, tries hard and puts all his efforts to do full justice to his role but doesn't have the killer looks of \"Bhiku Mhatrey\" in his eyes. The passion and aggression seen in Manoj Bajpai's act is completely missing here. Tinnu Anand, Shakti Kapoor and Mukesh Tiwari excel in their brief parts. Urvashi Sharma also does much better than her previous projects. Musically, out of the two songs incorporated in the script, I think the Qawwali track should have been used more, as it sounded quite catchy and lyrical in its brief version.Summing up, where director Ashu Trikha had everything in place for his big project, yet I couldn't understand why he chose such a jaded subject for his movie. He ineffectively tries to cover up the poorly written script with his competent direction, but fails to emerge as a winner because the viewer has already seen everything shown in the movie in far superior products such as \"Satya\", \"Company\" and more. So, I wish him all the luck for his next project. As far as his \"Baabarr\" is concerned, it may fetch better results in the smaller centers and single screen theaters out of the metros.\n",

I also felt him and Rani shared good chemistry in Hadh Kardi Apne so i couldn't wait to check this film out but was left in sheer disbelief at the end. \"How could they end it like that? Why? How could the directors, actors allow such an ending?\" is what i asked. The only reason i could think of is the film-makers were trying to show how much a deewana pyar can be! And boy is pyar one shocking deewana! Just look at the expressions on the actors/actresses faces. Om puri is in sheer shock at the deewana's actions, Poor Rani starts to cry, it was too much for her to bear and Govinda is just left speechless with the end. Even the supporting actors at the end can't hold their tears back, the director had shown them \" Pyar Deewana Hota Hai!.To be fair to the cast most of them do well despite one of the most unbelievable ending's. Rani puts in a restrained performance and shows she doesn't need big banner films to do well. Govinda has shades of seriousness and comedy in the role and i actually liked it. He was funny saying \" Baa baa baa\" or \"beh\". I felt also he created sympathy for his character in the film where his friends make fun of his lack of education or when he gets chucked out of his job. If only the film's ending was better.Jonny Lever has his moments. Deepak Tijori and Apoorva Agnihotri do not get much scoop. Om Puri is his dependable self. The rest do their job.Overall Pyar Deewana Hota Hai had potential to be a very very good film but the ending makes it a average affair. It is worth watching for Govinda's and Rani's performance.If you want to avoid the ending just do what i do whenever it comes on. Watch the film up until the ending and then change it over and assume all is well that ends well, otherwise you will be left wondering at the sheer stupidity of the ending.\n",

            "Suspense thriller? There was not a jot of suspense all through, I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist would be revealed in the last reel but because it would mean the end of the 1 hour 45 minutes discomfiture. Even Himesh Reshammiya's great music couldn't make it better. Aftab's acting was good but Celina does not even know the ABC of acting all she knows is how to show off her body. In most of the scenes there is definitely something that has a red colour e.g. Aftab's red shirt, Amrita's red top, Celina's red dress and red light in the night club that is an OK idea because it kept on reminding you of the title but when the whole screen goes red before the next scene that was far to annoying. The story was good but it was far too slow although it's nearly 2 hours it seems like a 3-hour movie. The ending was quite clever but what is the use of watching a film for its ending?\n",

Just like a book (movie reference) I wanted to keep on reading and to know what was going to happen next.Not once during the movie did I get bored or felt as if the story was going nowhere. Every scene was well connected to the other and the songs were timed perfectly and they helped to strengthen the plot.If you're looking for a film that is not bland, over complicated or just ridiculous Barkahaa is the one for you.Overall, it is well worth a watch with also a few nice quotes.

Mostly the point in the movie is that if You have a dream then Go For It, doesn't matter what it takes.Aryan is not a great movie, but a good movie to watch a Friday night. The movie has nothing great to offer than its stylish, ordinary songs but good acting from specially Sohail Khan. Sneha is OK, but still need a lot of acting classes, cause Bollywood is packed with Beauties but not talent.Aryan IS NO ROCKY, and don't even try to compare it cause you will regret watching Aryan , cause Rocky is a master piece.****SPOILER**** There is Specially one scene in Aryan which is touching when Sohail Khans Neighbor goes to Sneha's family to tell Sneha that the Noicy Aryan is all quite all day long, No Music or TV or Laughing, the only thing she hears is Aryan crying. This scene is great and small scenes like this make the movie good.The Villain in the movie is good as well, don't know his name but he did a lot of training to do this role.Overall an OK movie and I give it a 8 cause of a good attempt.\n",

            "At times, few films rightly and nobly bring forward a burning social issue, pointing towards the questionable faulty structure of our society, giving us some food for thought. But sadly, they are not made with that finesse and are not able to deliver the message that impactfully as required to reach the targeted common man. Evidently RAJJO remains one of those well intentioned films, made on a bold subject of 'giving the forced-in prostitutes' their respectable place back in the society, defying the set rules of a Hindi film. Yet, it is not able to leave any kind of solid impression on the viewers, due to its lazy screenplay and passionless, ineffective portrayal of a relevant issue.Supported by some extremely talented names such as Mahesh Manjrekar, Prakash Raj, Jaya Prada (a cameo), Vipin Sharma, Uttam Singh, Binod Pradhan & more, the film should have been much better lead by Kangna playing the women-centric role of sex-worker. However, director Vishwas Patil is not able to materialize on his subject and cast as desired, resulting in a pretty below average film quite unfortunately. It begins with the Mumbai 'Kothas' raising the expectation levels, reminding you of films like Mahesh Bhatt's SADAK which had Pooja Bhatt, in somewhat similar role along with Sanjay Dutt. But the un-happening first half completely ruins the initial excitement and then few better scenes post interval are also not able to bring it back till the end.Music, which ideally should be a highlight of films with such themes, is another big disappointment here and so is the writing or dialogue department of the film too, giving you nothing above than the routine. There is an improved Kangna in action along with the confident Paras Arora enacting with the big names with an ease. Plus the director also tries to express his storyline without taking the help of any objectionable language, abusive or vulgarity. So, no doubt the film had a very commendable and noble thought behind its making looking at the final product, but I only wish they had worked more on its script, music, dialogues and hard-hitting element in particular, which is a must for such socially relevant subjects to leave a lasting impact.\n",

How a simple heart can touch millions of people is just something which we know exists, but find hard to believe. Particular is the scene where the designer (R Zutshi)rushes and demands to know from Mita Vasisht, who the 'bai' is who has taken over a well known client, and the bai (Sarita Joshi) says innocently 'Upar wale ne kya kala dee hai aapke haatho may...' These simple words spoken in a true manner touch him so much that his anger just evaporates in seconds. A terrified/skeptical Sarita Joshi comes from Matheran to Mumbai 'just' to purchase a Saree. Its 'just' a Saree to us, but its her dream. Shes toiled hard for four years, working endlessly and skipping meals so that she could save money for her dream. Mita Vasisht as usual does her job well. Purab Joshi is getting better as an actor, although he has yet to learn a lot, but I'm sure he will. The dusky model (sorry i don't know her name) is good. She should work on her dialect. The parsi millionaire and his grandson have done justice to their part. However, the showstopper (like as said in the movie about the 'dream' Saree) is Sarita Joshi. Everyone started admiring her talent from Baa Bahu Aur Baby, and here she has delivered her best performance to date. Krishnaswamy Priya has done a fabulous job and obviously the entire credit goes to him. I wish NFDC would make more movies, meaningful movies. I miss movies like Karamaati Coat, Woh Chokri, etc. All in all, watch it, n I'm sure you will love it.\n",

            "Watching the first few minutes of ALLAH KE BANDE made me remember three different films from three different regions. One was the English film \"Sleepers\" (1996) which was about few child characters who are made to choose the wrong path of crime after their brutal exploitation in the tender age. Second was the world classic \"City of God\" or \"Cilade de Deus\" (2002) from Brazil which is considered among the world's best movies made on the subject of child crime. And the third was our own recent flick \"City of Gold\" (2010) which was also based on the same subject in the background of Bombay Mill workers of the 80s.The reason of recalling these three films was the same old one, as I found ALLAH KE BANDE a mixture of all the above mentioned movies with only one worth remembering scene and several forgettable ones. Directed by the debutant Faruk Kabir, who also has enacted one of its key role, the film can only be rated as a fine effort from the newcomer but nothing more than that. If only he had chosen either a different kind of subject or a different kind of treatment, it could have been a different case. But in the current scenario, the film is based on the same old content of children from the slums getting into the world of crime due to their own greed and sexual exploitation by some ruthless men leading to the ages old plot of gangsters and their internal clashes.Starting from the childhood days of two energetic kids, the director, Faruk Kabir, surprisingly spends almost more than one hour of its first half only on their childhood sequences. And after that too right till its intermission he is still busy in only introducing his various characters on the screen in a pretty over-confident manner. In fact every frame of the director clearly indicates his forceful attempt of deliberately making a path breaking film on the subject of child crime. But unfortunately he never gives you anything fresh to enjoy and his narration too remains identical to what we have already seen in many previous movies made around the same theme. Throughout the movie, Kabir only seems to be interested in showing everything with some extraordinary passion, energy and power. And maybe that is the reason why every actor looks like doing it little over the top in the entire film including both the child actors in its first half.Actually as I see it, no one can make a classic or a path braking film intentionally or willfully. Classics get made on their own unknowingly without any deliberate efforts of the team and even the people who make them, are themselves not aware of how they were able to do it so perfectly. Therefore, it was a huge mistake of Faruk Kabir to even think that he was making a great film, which will be setting new trends in the Industry. Dreaming on the same lines he makes every actor on the screen do some overacting and go over the top where they are shouting, laughing and walking in a style which is a bit more than what was actually needed.The second mistake he has made is to cast himself in the role of Yakub who is one of the two lead characters in the story. Frankly speaking he himself comes out to be the most unfit and over the top actors on the screen in that role and he surely should have chosen someone else to do it for him. On the other hand, Sharman Joshi as his only childhood friend turned gangster delivers a very well controlled and polished performance playing the role of Vijay, which even goes one step ahead of his effortless performance in 3 IDIOTS.Apart from these two key characters, there is Naseeruddin Shah as their cunning Jail Warden, who excels in his transformed character of a beggar in the second half. Atul Kulkarni as the truthful teacher and Zakhir Hussain as their gangster aid play their roles perfectly. But Anjana Sukhani and Rukhsaar are not given enough scenes to prove themselves. Suhasini Mulay as the mother of kids is impactful, whereas the kids have done it a bit louder as I mentioned before. Cinematography using the actual slum locations makes the film watchable getting good support from its background music department. But at the same time, the second half also makes you yawn at several moments since you already know what's going to happen next.Post intermission, there are two sequences worth mentioning here which are quite opposite to each other in terms of merit. The first sequence featuring Sharman Joshi (as a gangster) and Naseeruddin Shah (as a beggar), defining forgiveness, puts the director in the top bracket for conceiving it with such brilliance. But the second sequence of setting fire to the body of a teenager boy (lying on a four wheeler vegetable seller's cart) by his own teacher, in front of a group of children of 5- 15 years of age, raises many questions on the sensibility, morality and thought process of the director's mind. Truly speaking, I was just thinking of walking out of the theater after watching this unbelievable kind of scene shot in the name of creativity.So, in all ALLAH KE BANDE can just be appreciated for its decent kind of effort made by its first time director. But talking about everything else, it goes well over the top, exploiting the same old theme of slums, child-crime, gangsters and gang wars for the nth time along with some erratic writing. Hence it would be better to watch the ongoing popular serials on the small screen having a good time in your homes and don't even think of watching it with your entire family in the theaters.\n",

            "The movie shows the love and depth in 2 relations, one of Mother and son and other of two people(in this story) men in Love. The relationship between the men is shown beautifully which breaks usual myths in Indian mentality that it looks wrong, vulgar or two men(or woman) are in this just for sex. It correctly shows that the relationship is a normal one involving care and support for each other and cherishing beautiful moments together.It also shows the mother at first being in denial and completely shocked when the son out out but then gradually accepts her son as is once she understands that there is nothing wrong about it. She goes on to defend her son in front of his Dad and supports him like a rock. That shows the power of mother's love. She not only faces her fears of the relationship but also discovers her long lost passion for painting, thanks to her son.Overall a must watch movie for everyone and superb performance by lead actors. Mom played by Mona shines the best.\n",

A movie that presents you with a whirlpool of ideas and a storm of striking images, this one is a true cult item that goes beyond experimentation. In the 100 minutes, this movie packs an enormous amount of satire and possibly the highest number of genres in a single wrapper. Taking a shot at everything from surrealism to extreme realism, Kamal Swaroop presents a truly exhaustive picture of the Indian middle class in a country full of diversity, but with a style that you will not fully grasp because it is just not possible. Certain things will stand out and haunt you forever but certain others, though maybe more important, will not sink in. It is, though, once in a life viewing experience\n",

Anand Tiwari as hiten, the gujrati is refreshing, he acts funny - just amazing. the trio with ravi kishan also does justice to their characters. the climax was great and as with Indian philosophy or movies it is one who deserves it gets it.only thing that ticked me off is it's title - if they had come up with an apt title - a large audience could have seen this. well, kudos to director for a quality debut.\n",

            "mahesh manjrekar's movie about the relationship between a man and his disabled kid brother is worth watching for some wonderfully sentimental moments between the two. on the other hand, occupying equal time in the movie is a not-so-subtle comment on society's lack of morality and values. the directorial talent is clearly visible....but the script leaves much to be desired. the films pace falls too often and a certain triteness settles in. the director should be criticized for playing too much to the gallery... putting in unnecessary love songs and conflicts, thus, straying from the main theme of the movie. the music is hummable at best, but works in the key scenes.ajay devgan does a very competent job as the older brother torn between the woman he loves and the brother he can't live without.devgan is certainly emerging to be one of the best actors in bollywood...taking into account his performances in zakhm and hum dil de chuke sanam. one just hopes that he doesnt get stereotyped. but the highlight of the film is dushyant wagh who attracts everyone's admiration for his portrayal of the afflicted child. the actor's playing devgan's neighbours never seem to have heard of subtlety. most of them, barring the one playing the aged man, are loud and crass. it is probably a true depiction of the middle class in metros but it certainly needs better treatment because sometimes those characters just end up being annoying.on a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give this a high 6. recommended for some good acting, a well-picturised and well-composed title-song and most importantly, some touching moments.\n",

Surprisingly all the reviews were poor and it bomb ed at the box office.Last night I found PKPS on You Tube so I watched it as a comedy is much better than a violent or serious movie just before bedtime.Well Patel Ki Punjabi Shaadi is certainly not as bad as the critics and other reviewers make it out to be. It is stretched in parts and a bit too much propaganda of so called Gujarati 'asmita' and 'over the top' Punjabiyat but other than that it is a very watchable film with a good dose of humour. I especially liked the few political digs that were stuck in the dialogues here and there ...PKPS does not purport to be serious cinema or anything other than fun; in this case centred around the romance between a Punjabi lad and a Gujarati lass. The Punjabi family come to live in a typical Gujarati society and the humour takes off from there. It is not a rib tickling comedy but the dialogues are witty and overall it is a humorous film.So much for the critics and poor reviews ....\n",

You don't see that in much of the Bollywood films. Overall I thought it was a good enough movie for me. In the end, it's only my opinion. Some people like it, some don't.

            "Unlike Hollywood, our Indian film Industry doesn't have many production houses backing children films with a decent budget. And the box office result of last few such films surely remains one big reason for that limited interest of Bollywood. So when Disney Films backs up a project made around a Children super hero Zokkomon, then one is bound to expect something great or extraordinary from the world famous pioneers of the genre.But once again the final result comes out to be far less than expected and the present project too is not capable of making any huge storm at the box office. In simple words, the film is not anything great but is not very bad either and is better than many sun-standard projects earlier churned out in the name of children films. Director Satyajit Bhatkal gives the right feel and look to the film along with some good visible production values. But if only he had given more time and stress upon the script, then the film could have been a rage among the kids.In a super-hero film the story is quite obvious that a person will get some super powers and then he will fight with all the cunning people and law breakers out there in a different outfit. But here the first drawback of the movie is that its main story plot borrows heavily from the one we have already seen in a well made children film by Vishal Bhardwaj, MAKDEE. Secondly, it takes too much time to bring in the super hero on the screen which should not be the case in such a film. And lastly though the super-hero sequences have been shot well but still they are not so entertaining or amusing for the kids to have a blast.However, a major and intelligent difference in the film is that the super-kid here doesn't have any illogical super natural powers, but he actually gets all those capabilities from the scientific gadgets designed by the 'Magic Uncle' living in the haunted house. But unfortunately the director doesn't give you any acceptable explanations for the gadgets made and thus they remain very questionable and un- convincing throughout. Further, a children film should essentially have very few but good hummable songs which ZOKKOMON doesn't. Moreover I am also strongly against using any death, dead body or cremation scenes in a children film creating some uneasy situations for the parents.Performance wise, Darsheel Safary perfectly portrays his role of a super-kid and looks confident along with Anupam Kher as always impressive in a double role. In fact many viewers may not even recognize him in his second role of the Magic Uncle. But the conviction with which he performs all his roles is indeed highly appreciable. Manjari Fadnis as Darsheel's Kittu Didi looks fresh and charming on the screen performing well. Tinnu Anand is fine in his routine kind of role and the kids supporting as Darsheel's friends are pleasant and appealing.On the whole, ZOKKOMON does have its own share of weak points and is not anything great offered in the genre of super-hero films. Still looking at its fine production values and good enjoyable performances you can watch it with your kids but preferably after its official DVD release.\n",

            "Directed by the renowned theater veteran Feroz Abbas Khan as his second film post GANDHI, MY FATHER (2007), this is indeed a courageous attempt by the makers, since there is not much possibility of such a dark, sarcastic film becoming a big box office success in the current scenario. Reportedly based on some real life events happening in a small town, the film truly reminds you of the recent Muzzafar Nagar incidents leading to a huge loss of life, faith & trust among we all Indians. Made as an intelligent black comedy with many worth praising insertions, DTD surely could have become a daring, path breaking film of the recent times, if only the director had delivered it with a better pace & a more disturbing tension in its conflicting scenes. But keeping the weaker points aside, I would still like to recommend watching it mainly for the following well written and worth-praising scenes, taken straight out of our real lives fast heading towards a scary future. 1. The most valuable sequence in DTD is related to an old experienced historian, who is opposed for writing a controversial book on religious history and is then forced to peacefully withdraw or face some drastic consequences. Ignoring the threat, the calm historian willfully pulls out his hearing machine in between the heated conversation and the act indeed is a treat to watch, executed beautifully. Next all published copies of his book are burned (reminding you of many latest similar references) and that is exactly how history is now being forcefully re- written with a specific motive in almost all the religions proving them better than the rest.2. A wonderful courtroom scene wherein there is no proof of a dead person's birth, marriage, original religion or his so called religious conversion at all. But still the judge is supposed to give the judgment about the real owner of the dead body without any valid arguments put forward.3. A hilarious symbolic sequence in which Satish Kaushik (the owner of a local newspaper) is disgracefully talking to his imported puppy and the employed Indian editor together.4. In a mourning scene, the few women instantly stop wailing & start leaving as soon as someone says the water is back in the taps for a limited period.5. As a newly appointed police officer comes to join his police station, he is stunned to see 'A Religious Pooja' going on in the station itself and all the policemen attending it instead of going to their assigned duties.6. A Muslim leader openly addresses a meeting provoking the youth to attack is aggressively opposed by a Muslim journalist only who is thrown out of the meeting. And on the other hand a Hindu leader clearly warns the police officer in charge, not to interfere in their planned procession at all and do nothing.7. And lastly the undisclosed biased attitude of policemen when they personally know the convict and his particular religion. Following a quite honest and ironical treatment, the film simply reveals the truth that how riots are willfully triggered through an intentional planning by the two opponent leaders openly, whereas they also maintain constant contact with each other simultaneously behind the curtains. Intelligently written by Shafaat Khan (mostly as a play), the project has been made at a smaller scale with a clever cinematography which shows you the riots just through the window of a moving car without going out in the wide showcasing any big mob. Also the sound department beautifully uses only the natural sounds in the backdrop, creating a very realistic feel throughout in a worth noticing manner.With a short duration of less than 2 hours, DTD no doubt remains a comic yet alarming take on a burning issue edited thoughtfully. And with appreciable performances by Satish Kaushik (Leader/Newspaper Owner), Satish Alekar (Historian), Sharad Ponkshe (Hindu Leader) and Vinay Jain (the new IPS officer) along with a fairly impressive supporting cast, it can easily be rated as a praiseworthy attempt for sure, representing the meaningful cinema.Having said that, the film still isn't any great masterpiece or hugely engrossing watch too, mainly due to its few theatrical scenes & the multiple sub-plots resulting in a clumsy feel. Moreover few gags also do not work at all like the one about the police dog or the dead body's guard taking his clothes off. Plus the film was wrongly promoted with Satish Kaushik as the lead actor (in the posters) who actually has only few scenes in the movie unexpectedly.Summing up, DEKH TAMASHA DEKH made me think about the last moments of Bhagat Kabir in the past, which also generated a verbal debate among the followers upon the final rituals to be followed. Interestingly in the film too the whole fight is for the body of a converted Muslim only, whom Hindus wish to cremate and Muslims wish to bury, leading to the big bloody clash. And the storyline honestly made me imagine that if there happened to be a death of any similar saint in the present times too then that surely would have resulted in some cruel riots between communities, timely engineered by the opportunist politicians, unarguably.Anyway with a hope that we all become capable enough of realizing the ugly tricks played by our greedy leaders well in time before hurting the other. Do try to watch this thoughtful attempt as a must ignoring its theatrical feel and all the weaker points mentioned in the review.\n",

            "Usually, I can trust this website to have complete information on most things. In this case, however, IMDb seems to have nothing on this particular movie  which is a blessing in disguise for the makers of the movie, because it saves them some embarrassment. However, I am here to spoil all that.About a month ago, my wife and I decided to boycott partying every weekend and made our way to the cinema to watch the latest Hindi release \"Teesri Aankh  The Hidden Camera\". Since then, we have continued our partying ways.I visited this website the next morning to write my comments on the movie but could find no trace of this movie ever existing, until now, so I am here to write some comments.Teesri Aankh is an absolutely pathetic venture by loser director HARRY BAWEJA, where he pretends to expose the horrible effects experienced by women that get trapped in the porn ring. That's just an excuse to make this movie a flesh-fest, with clichéd dialogs and situations. Our cast is headed by Mr. Beef himself, SUNNY DEOL and his two leading ladies are AMISHA PATEL and NEHA DHUPIA. The former, as we have seen time and again, most notably in Mangal Pandey, has run out of reasons to continue in this industry. Whats makes it worse is that she's actually given a meaty role of a mute. The silver lining is that you don't hear her voice at all. But even her sign language is so annoying, you just want to tie her arms up. Our second leading lady is more of an extended special appearance, and her character is too dumb to understand that her 2 male agents (she plays a model) that are continuously ogling at her and looking up her skirt and down her bra, are eventually going to want to rape her.So she dies since her purity is so important to her, and her boyfriend Deol goes to London in search of her. He meets our mute friend who falls in love with him and helps him pursue his girlfriend's killers. So, most of the movie is shot in London, you would think. Ha! Every third scene takes the viewers to one of our characters (vile villains included) to a shot of them walking across Oxford street. And that's it. Even though the entire movie is supposedly taking place in London, the shooting isn't. Okay, maybe budgets were low, but could they have at least made the effort to make the place look like London.There's a fight scene in the night on an empty road, where Deol is smashing one of the sidey's head on a bus, and not only did they have an old, beat-up, Indian brand bus parked there, but it actually has yellow chameli garlands hanging in the windshield! Viewing of this movie can result in serious mental doubts about the state of Indian Cinema, so my advice is avoid unless your life depends on it. If you do watch it, and do survive the first half, my guess is the second will kill you. There's actually a scene where a villain across the road is running towards Sunny with a gun, and Sunny, seeing a nearby 4WD parked, kicks the car (YES  like a football, causing it to fly), which hits the villain who goes flying away. Wow, that is how you must take care of villains!You will have more fun tying and untying your shoe laces for 3 hours.\n",

This is a true story with nothing in the way of changes or embellishments. The producers of the film are modern, forward-looking Indian Nationals, who are appalled by many of the barbaric and inhumane traditions that are still prevalent in many rural areas of India.\"Sandstorm (Bawandar)\" decries just about everything that is wrong with India. None of those hypnotic ditsy Bollywood tunes here! Nor the slick, stylized India shown to us in \"Slumdog\". It is a festering, oozing sore of excruciatingly brutal (but not graphic) gang rape, perpetrated by the village elders, no less; one woman's courageous and determined quest for justice; an openly misogynist society, where institutionalized fratricide of female babies and marrying off girls as young as 8 years old by arranged marriages is an everyday occurrence; Practices that most people think were abandoned centuries ago, still thriving in India! \"Sandstorm\" is a scathing indictment of issues such as the \"Caste System\" where those on the lowest rung are considered \"untouchables\".A sensation of numbness overtook me, as one injustice after another cascaded before me! Yet, the dogged and unflinching determination demonstrated by rape victim, Saanvri, serves as a beacon of hope and is definitely the one bright spot of the film! This is a true story that MUST be told, just as its producers intended. Rating this film 9*, as I have, is by no means an endorsement of the vile crimes committed in this film, but instead, a show of solidarity with both the victim and the producers whose goal it was to make people aware of the dark side of India's tradition, culture and customs9********* .....

            "Randhir Kapoor's directorial debut film! The movie is based on how three generations live under one roof but with different opinions. The movie is a time-pass. The grandfather and grandson always had difference in thoughts while the father always tries to makeup between them. In the end, the grandfather dies giving the message that it is KAL AAJ AUR KAL. Performances are good especially Raj Kapoor's performance is very fine. He played a nice father and an obedient son. Shankar-Jaikishan's music is fine. I liked the song \"Aap Yahaan Aye Kisliye Aap Ne Bulaaya Isliye\". I would rate it as 7.5/10. One would not get bored while watching it.\n",

            "Certain films are made with a noble vision and a specific purpose which is courageous as well as an important one in the present world cunningly obsessed with religion in a questionable manner. And YA RAB is certainly one of those appreciable attempts which questions the Islamic link with the terrorism and then puts up many blunt arguments from both the sides, impressively quoting the HOLY QURAN in some solid, well written dialogues.Technically speaking, yes the execution gives you the feel of a tacky film with lots of shouting, hamming and overacting by the main actors. The production values are compromising and the film also follows a highly preachy way to say all the right things. But the message is indeed an important one and it needs to reach all the youngsters out there who are sadly used as a means to propagate terrorism by influencing their immature thought process. Director Hasnain Hyderabadwala comes to the point right from the first scene itself and clearly counters the way The Holy Scriptures are being interpreted in the wrong manner by all the Religious teachers or leaders for their own hidden interests. For instance, a valuable dialogue in the film says that, \"Strangely the whole world has found only one word in The HOLY QURAN i.e. JIHAAD and is spreading its wrong meaning all over the globe to justify various things.\" Further it clearly reveals that this particular word & wrong interpretations of the Holy Text is not only being used by the others but by the community people too with a motive of misguiding the innocent youth and using them as their disposable tools of terrorism. Another important sequence in the film also strongly points towards the 'Blind Donations' a person usually gives to the religious leader, taking it as his moral duty which in reality might be contributing as a fund raiser to some objectionable underground activities leading to terrorism. And I really feel this is a quite significant point to understand by every person of any age, irrespective of his religion or region.Looking at the film from this particular perspective, YA RAB is a genuine effort made to show the right meaning of Islam and its sacred teachings. And the film also has certain worth watching elements which take this positive thought forward in a pretty decent way. Like, it has an intelligent little boy who remembers his holy scriptures by heart and understands them much better than many grownups around. An elderly religious leader, who knows, accepts and declares that everyone is wrongly interpreting the things and misleading the youth, whereas this is not the Islam I have learned and understood. And then there is a well known neurosurgeon, who is religious by heart but also a highly qualified medical practitioner who knows the importance & use of both religion and science individually.So in the writing department, we do have some well conceived characters, powerful dialogues and few counter explanations too revealing all the actual meanings. But the film does have its own shortcomings in terms of presentation, execution and performances which convert it into a loud melodramatic project made with a focused and positive mindset. For example Akhilendra Mishra could have done it more calmly without shouting and stretching his tone dramatically. Ajaz Khan shows the sparks in few scenes but still needs to come out of his acting school sessions fast. The lead pair along with the entire supporting cast are just OK and the 2 major saviors in the performance section remain S.M. Zaheer as the learned Maulana and Manzar Sehbai from Pakistan playing the thoughtful neurosurgeon. In fact I was most interested in watching the film for Manzar Sehbai alone remembering his towering performance in the masterpiece BOL (2011). And he didn't disappoint me at all standing amid all the other loud performers, especially in the climax. Cinematography captures the final moments of riots, ambulance and chaos competently and background score does make its presence felt, particularly in the tense sequences.In all, YA RAB is a kind of precious effort which should be ideally watched by all simply ignoring its weaker points, performances or production values. Director Hasnain Hyderabadwala has made it in search of a better world around and his noble effort does need to be applauded by one and all, unanimously. However I seriously wish YA RAB gets remade soon with a better vision, at a bigger scale and featuring one of the BIG KHANS. So if any one of them is listening then just go for it or any similar effort, as this would be your earnest gift both to your profession as well as to your respected religion.in search of a better harmonious future for our coming generations.\n",

I'd enjoy an earnest adaptation of the tale of Savitri and Satyavan.This film, however, is not that.No level of familiarity with the fable this film supposedly bases itself on will help you to predict the turns it's going to take. Every scenario our heroine is presented with becomes more preposterous, and the screenplay is so absurd that I'm reminded of the campy B-movie classic 'Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.'I can understand why there was apparently such an uproar over this film when it was set to be released. But I'll say this much: As bad as this movie is, at least it has a coherent plot. And by virtue of being so ridiculous, I found myself laughing like few films can do, wondering if what I was watching on the screen actually just happened.Ultimately, the good news is that this movie is comedic gold, and fun despite its flaws. The bad news is, it's not supposed to be funny. Take that as you will.\n",

            "Sagar Ballary, tasted success with his first directorial venture BHEJA FRY and then later on made some vaguely attempted comedies including the sequel of his first film. But not even one of his later ones was able to impress the viewers and HUM TUM SHABANA is also not an exception to that fact. May be the actual reason behind this is that BHEJA FRY was a scene to scene lift from a French Film and all his other films are not a blatant copy of any other Hit from the World Cinema.Besides, his latest flick HUM TUM SHABANA is regrettably the worst attempt made by the director which is annoyingly loud, silly, irritating and a big pain especially in its second half which can easily be termed as intolerable too. The film starts off with an interesting plot of a beauty pageant where two boys from the organizer's team are trying to win over one of their lovely contestants. But just after the first 30 minutes, the execution becomes frustrating and you are not able to enjoy anything in the entire later part of the film. Particularly its last hour can give you a severe headache with all that noise and shouting going on in the name of a comedy.A film can only have good performances if the script allows the artists to perform and the director has got a particular vision to follow. But HTS, in absence of any appreciable script or a basic vision of the director, simply wastes all the talent hidden in the names such as Satish Kaushik, Shreyas Talpade, Tushar Kapoor and Sanjay Mishra. The ladies Minissha and Pia are also there only as the beauty mannequins and are not going to get any kind of response from the movie itself.Actually, as I felt, the biggest culprit of the film is its Sound Mixing in which we have a very loud background score continuously being played along with the dialogues throughout the film in a very unintelligent manner. At times the effects are so deafening that one fails to hear the funny lines said by the actors and feels like walking out of the hall. Yet, there is only one positive thing in HUM TUM SHABANA and that's the work done by the music director duo Sachin-Jigar who come up with some catchy numbers like \"Hey Na Na Na Shabana\" and \"Music Band Na Karo\", which are sure going to be played in the pub and discos.Overall, strictly be far away from this if you want to keep your peace of mind intact.\n",

            "An average Bollywood flick with Ex-VJ Amrita Arora in her first feature film role, a love story about two young NRIs living in the U.S. who go back to India to get married - though both to someone else. Still, they keep bumping into each other on their rather difficult journey home until the frequency of music and dance scenes starts getting higher (i. e. they have fallen in love). The plot is said to have been modelled on the Hollywood flick Forces of Nature (which I haven't seen). Though quite average, I'd still consider this an ok movie: well choreographed song and dance scenes (though not particularly spectacular ones) and nice, good-looking, rather believable actors in the main roles. Though it was quite peculiar that many dialog scenes were very badly filmed (with bad lighting and awkward camera movements), while in the music and dance sequences the cinematographer seems to have changed: they were just perfect! There you can see again what is most important about masala movies... This was the second Bollyfilm I have seen as a whole, so I cannot compare it really to lots of others, but I'd still say this is an average, but definitely watchable film, probably also for European audiences. I think here especially of the target group of older Eastern European women who love Latin-American soap-operas (like in my native Hungary) - they'd surely like this one, too... :)\n",

This is unfortunate cause the movie is very good. Produced by Mehmood's brother Anwar Ali and directed by Lekh Tandon with a classic score by Rajesh Roshan this movie has songs by Kishore Kumar, Lata, Amit Kumar. All the songs are classics like Angrezi Mein Kehte Hain Ke I Love You, Mach Gaya Shor, Disco 82, Oonche Neeche Raaste, Hatja Baju and Maa Ka Pyar (not in the movie). The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjeev Kumar, Tanuja, Parveen babi, Vinod Mehra, Bindiya Goswami, Prem Chopra, Ramesh Deo, Mehmood, AK Hangal and others. The story revolves around 3 brothers played by Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh and Vinod. Sanjeeb is the older brother who dotes on his 2 young stepbrothers. When he marries Tanuja she gets jealous of their bond and the 2 younger brothers run away from home. Amitabh sacrifies everything to get Vinod an education and it seems that everything will turn out right. Then Vinod gets to know rich girl Bindiya Goswami and Amitabh's world falls apart when his brother chooses money over him. Amitabh also meets his older brother by now who is a judge but Sanjeev doesn't recognise him though there is a friendship between the 2 older brothers. Watch when a murder is committed, Amitabh is arrested and tried in court where Sanjeev is the judge. All the performances are first rate. Vinod, Bindiya, AK Hangal. But the movie belongs to Sanjeev Kumar (though in a supportung role) and Amitabh, the main character. These movies don't get made anymore. Amitabh can make you laugh by just saying \" yes\" (in the Can You Tell Me What Time It Is -scene\" and he can make you cry with his taxi. A great film you must watch!\n",

            "Before making the recent serious movies based on few realistic subjects, director Jagmohan Mundhra was more associated with many controversial projects made around the subject of sex. And probably NAUGHTY @ 40 was also planned on those similar lines as a Sex-Comedy with Govinda playing a 40 years old virgin looking for help from his friends.The film has a very stale look may be due to its long in the making time span. Govinda tries his best to give you the same old good time in the theater, but in the process fails miserably. The film remains a badly made comedy which neither makes you laugh nor keeps you hooked on to the screen effectively. Moreover, NAUGHTY @ 40 is clearly inspired from two major sources. One as the name suggests is obviously the English Sex Comedy \"THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN\" released in 2005. The first half of the film is strictly written around this hilarious plot not exploited in an entertaining way at all.But the second half of the movie is heavily inspired from one of our own Bollywood's Sex-Comedy's called \"ANUBHAV\" released in 1986 which had Shekhar Suman, Padmini Kolhapure and Richa Sharma in the lead. In fact this film became hugely famous in the year of its release due to its highly controversial bold scenes which were the first of its kind in Indian Cinema at that particular point of time. The plot of marrying a girl having a childish mind knowing nothing about the rituals and adjustments post marriage straight away reminds you of that enjoyable comedy of the mid eighties and its famous scenes.\n",

            "In this documentary, film-maker Damon Gameau becomes his own guinea pig and spends 60 days eating healthy foods with added sugar. Before this process, he had eradicated sugar from his diet so the contrast is even more pronounced. Over the course of the 60 days he puts on considerable weight, experiences mood swings and notices a drop in overall motivation.What I found so alarming about this film was that it didn't play things easy and simply expose the dangers of excessive sugar intake. Gameau doesn't consume any junk food whatsoever, such as fizzy juice, sweets or ice cream, he instead purely sticks to food marketed as healthy. It's this more than anything that sets off alarm bells because this route seems to most people a route to weight loss and improved physical well-being, yet as the film demonstrates it actually leads to obesity and mental damage. Time and again we are shown the volumes of sugar that is hidden in so-called 'healthy' foods and it makes you pause for thought. What comes out loud and clear is that sugar is clearly a socially acceptable form of addiction and the sugar industry have been instrumental in minimising public information on the dangers their product presents. It's very interesting to note that over the course of his 60 day experiment Gameau eats no more calories than he did previously, yet he puts on almost a stone in weight. One of the key lessons, therefore, is that there are calories and there are calories, i.e. sugar calories affect the body decidedly differently to the way protein and carb ones do.The approach taken by the film is very much of the fun and informative variety. Sometimes the humour doesn't work so well but in the main this approach is good in that it is very accessible. After all, this is a film that you would want children to watch and learn from. There are a couple of star cameos with Hugh Jackman giving us a brief history lesson about man's relationship with sugar and Stephen Fry pops up to explain some of the science behind it. On the whole, I found this to be an excellent wake-up call about a subject I had hitherto given minimal thought to. There is a lot of very valuable information in this film that could be genuinely life changing if applied to your day to day life, and I reckon that is as good a recommendation as anyone could need.\n",

            "The publicity for this movie was very misleading by showcasing it as a romantic comedy about Arshad Warsi and Mahima. These two just play two of the many characters in this film. The movie takes a look in an episodical fashion at several struggling couples who are stuck at an airport due to a long delay of their flight. These couples are either lost loves, broken hearts, on the verge of divorce, or divorcées. The idea is interesting, but it is not executed well. The movie becomes extremely long-drawn and boring. The audience begins to get as impatient as the characters in the movie waiting to board their flight. What I mainly got out of this film is that in today's busy world, we are all running around, struggling to stay on top of schedule, and end up ignoring, hurting, and miscommunicating with those who mean most to us. All it takes is a few \"forced\" hours of conversation with no distractions to clear up misunderstandings, lucidly see the other's point of view, and realize where one's position in life is. We need to shell out time for our loved ones and communicate with them to avoid broken relationships and/or unnecessary anger/hurt/fear. Mahima and \"the crier\" gave good performances. Arshad Warsi should stick to comedies and supporting roles as in Munnabhai and Salaam Namaste. Shahrukh's special appearance was really pointless.\n",

Anurag Singh's direction is amateurish and the screenplay is suited for the B-grade thrillers. I would like to ask Rahul Khanna that if he's only going to appear in about two Hindi films every 5 years, why pick the rotten apples from the trashcan? No doubt that the actor has talent, now only if he picked the right films. None of the performances are up to mark. This is the first Tanushree Dutta film, I've seen and she's quite a bad actress.

Tagore, who shocked the public by wearing a bikini, does a nice job of playing a double role. The music, and there is a lot of it, is catchy with a definite 60's feel to it. Tagore's costumes were exceptionally lovely.

After all, there are numerous Harry Potter clones (\"Tanya Grotter\" in Russia, \"Porri Gatter\" in Belarus, \"Barry Trotter\" in Germany, etc.), so why couldn't there be a nice Bollywood version? Especially all the noise Time Warner made about it was all I needed to go and purchase it.What a waste! First of all, the movie has nothing in common with Harry Potter at all. On the contrary, it seems to be a loose remake of \"Home Alone\". It is the story of a boy and a girl who were \"forgotten\" by their parents when they left for a trip, and now find themselves forced to defend the house against two clumsy bad guys. Obviously, the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but as such it has become a complete failure. The so-called humour is of the lowest standard. The scenario is a bad joke in itself, characterised by the silliest texts one can imagine, the story lacks a single good idea, and the acting is plain horrible. Even the presence of such capable actors as Jackie Shroff and Lilette Dubey cannot be of any help here.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yet, I don't even think Hari Puttar will ever make it into a cult movie of the \"so bad it's good\" type. The movie is just embarrassing, not amusing at all, and poorly made. In fact, it is one of the rare movies that have made me angry.Somebody called it an \"average film but an entertaining one for kids\". Well, if I were a kid, I would feel insulted by such low level. In my opinion, this movie is neither average nor entertaining; it's merely boring and utterly silly. Obviously, its creators don't have a clue regarding kids.

Brilliant tight screenplay. Music could have been much better considering it as a musical film but it wont upset you. Somewhere romance in the story seems lacking and the transition of Sanju (Aadar Jain) from being a pessimist to an optimistic guy is all of sudden. Too much of punjabi used in the film to keep it real but subtitles could have helped. Anyway overall this one is fresh out of the box. Low marketing might hit the film but its defiantly a must watch. Long way to go Anya.\n",

            "Zindagi Ek Juaa review :Originally planned with Amitabh Bachchan in mind, the film went to Anil Kapoor after the Prakash Mehra -Bachchan rift post Jaadugar (1989). The tragic story was more suited to Amitabh's style and swag and though Anil did a reasonably good job, the film couldn't reach up to the level of Mehra's earlier tragic drama Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978). Had it been made in that era with Big B in Anil's role, Zindagi Ek Juaa would've worked well.Bappi Lahiri's gave yet another chartbuster music to Mehra after their previous successful collaborations. The title track and Kabhi Kuch Khoyaa.. are my personal favourite.One of the rare movies in that time which shows heroine (Madhuri Dixit) getting addicted to drugs and later, dying of overdose. The film largely suffered due to its excessive run time and that climax which seemed to go on and on...Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "Govind Nihalani's \"Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa\" served as the opening film of a festival dedicated to Indian films held here recently.As such kind of film event is a rare occasion in our country, so is the film a rare gem.Given its material (which was adapted from a novel by Mahaswati Deva), the film has the potential of becoming overtly political (like Constantin Costa-Gavras' \"Z\") or expressly melodramatic (like Regis Wargnier's \"Indochine\").But it is a fine attribute of the film that it provides just enough background for the viewers to become acquainted with the intense sociopolitical events in India (particularly in West Bengal) in the 1970s---a radical outlawed movement, the \"Naxalbari,\" proves to be major headache for the established leadership---and keeps finely checked and nuanced the thoughts and feelings of the characters that the result is a quietly powerful and moving drama of loss, alienation and enlightenment.The brutal murder of a radical and forward-thinking son causes for the mother to embark on a journey of self-examination and -discovery---asking questions as to the circumstances that led to her son's untimely death, what made her overlook and take for granted her son's \"secret\" activities, and seeing in her own family the very things her son had rebelled against (complacent, hypocritical, reactionary and bourgeois attitudes and values in modern society).The film proceeds on a slow and reflective pace so as to be proper to its conversational approach, which is of such a length that the characters gradually open their minds and hearts to the viewers regarding the lamentable family loss and the state of their society in general.Take careful notice of the scene where the mother visits her son's girlfriend, who is also a member of the movement and where mother and son \"meet\" one another for the last time.To be distinguished too are the stunning performances, specially those provided by the actors who played the beleaguered mother, the loving aunt and the ill-fated son.If you have the opportunity, don't miss \"Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa.\"\n",

            "The best part that i liked about this movie was when Jigyaasa was an innocent girl and went to people to ask for work. They exploit her. Than later when Jigyaasa is a super-star, She exploits them. They say revenge is a dish best served cold. This is what follows the film.The story-telling and the style and grammar of cinema used in this film makes you think of any Roman Polanski movie. The flash-back part is handled very well. The performances especially of the lead protagonist Hrishitaa Bhatt is of first rate. Her character in the movie transforms and travels through the time period. The climax however does full justice to the film, But you start to feel that it's not convincing to the character Jigyaasa.The film maker Faisal Saif has tried to portray the reality behind bollywood (Indian Film World). And has succeeded in making a film that makes you face to face on behind the scenes journey of a super-star. This film takes names of lots of known personality (secretly) in bollywood. Every scene shows the amount of hard work had gone into it. The film maker has tried to touch every possible topic and issue that we usually hear of on T.V or in any gossip magazine.A film that is not to be missed at any cost!\n",

            "The first collaboration between Sunil Shetty and Ashok Honda resulted in a barbarous action film, Anth. Rakshak was their second outing which could not match the stupendous success of Anth. However, this picture is better since it is supported with superior direction as compared to Anth. In addition, Rakshak also has a plot which is more engrossing than Anth. If the film falters, it is because of some of the acting instead of the direction.Rakshak's storyline consists of a coma patient who is being targeted by some criminals. After he is rescued and revived, we come to know that Raj Sinha was once an Assistant Superintendent of Police. He was leading a positive life with his family members. He visited his village after giving his police course exams. During his stay, he is notified of his success in those courses. Basically, he becomes an ASP of the Indian Police Force. Unfortunately, all this happiness is short lived. Sadly, wicked situations and vicious circumstances were against Sinha and his family members. It can be predicted that the antagonists of Rakshak are responsible for all the toil and trouble in Raj's colorful life. However, the entire chain of events demonstrating this are well shot in the first half. The audience's attention is hooked for the most part. After watching a great deal of cruel injustice, the audiences (especially Sunil Shetty fans) will be interested to witness Sunil's character ferociously ravage the antagonists of this film. In other words, the audiences will rarely find a boring moment in this film.Ashok Honda's direction is good but it somehow falters towards the climax. The entire climatic battle is overdone and there is an overdose of violence. The first half is mostly coherent with occasional snags like a few crude comedy scenes. For instance, the \"Kuchi Kuchi\" game between Sunil and Karishma is a little crude after the first couple times. The second half is much more serious with a lot of bloodshed which will entertain action lovers.Action sequences are mostly well choreographed by Ravi Dewan. Dewan is more creative this time without shying away from the brutality. However, the pre-climax action scene is preposterous. This is because Sunil is able to dodge numerous bullets while driving a jeep which never gets damaged until the end. I understand that 1990s action sequences are not meant to be very realistic. However, such an action scene with an increasingly unrealistic invincibility factor is just too hard to digest.Anand Milind's music is very refreshing having some of the biggest hits of the 1990s. Shehar Ki Ladki is a catchy song with hilarious lyrics. The song went on to become a chartbuster in the mid 1990s. Kuchi Kuchi was added eventually and it also quickly climbed the charts. It's lyrics are fun and it has also been well shot like Shehar Ki Ladki. Sundara Sundara was the second biggest hit in the film, it is a decent song. The sensuous song, Uee Yaa, is forgettable. However, Zaalim Jahan Berang Hai has superior lyrics. It manages to successfully show Sunil's transformation from a weakened person to a brawny individual. The song contains some training montages which are a delight to watch.Sunil Shetty shines in the action sequences but is far from outstanding in other aspects of acting. In the 1990s, he was never great at emoting. However, he was surprisingly better at emoting in some of his previous films like Takkar. In Rakshak, he overacts terribly in some important scenes. For example, when he has to weep inconsolably for the demise of his loved ones, he hams it up. In addition, when he has to shout at the villains, he hams it up. In some of his other flicks, he would not overdo such scenes. In short, he was much better in films like Mohra, Takkar, and Gopi Kishan. Karishma Kapoor is hilarious in some scenes but it was depressing to watch her innocent character meet such a tragic demise. She looks ravishing and does her role with ease. Sonali Bendre has a shorter role but she is excellent here. Instead of simply being a bimbette, she gets a role and she is convincing as the lady doctor. Aruna Irani is successfully convincing as Sunil's mother in the film. Raghuvaran appears menacing but he overdoes his villainy. Mushtaq Khan is good in a few hilarious sequences during the first half of the film. He is also decent as the caring friend of Sunil after Sunil's family is wiped out. Alok Nath is convincing as the police commissioner who encourages Sunil to join the police force. Deepak Shirke is alright as the corrupt cop. The rest provide decent support.On the whole, Rakshak is engrossing but it could have been better. It's action and music stand out the most. However, Sunil's underperformance and some inconsistencies largely affect the film. Despite this, Rakshak is still worth a watch because it keeps you hooked mostly.\n",

The over the top beginning scene that a man could simply kick an overturned vehicle back so easily and made it crash into the assault mob was just ridiculous, and the slow motion to show how he hit and kicked those guys and made them fly into the air and crashed all over the place was just an early sure sign of how bad this movie could become later. Then his wife, his chief of police and him played another cartoon-like absurd scene was another chip fell badly to further prove the failure of this lousy movie. Lot of unnecessary slow motioned scenes then suddenly back to normal were just stupid. The lame screenplay was just laughable that was further ruined by the brainless non-talent directing, making the childish shallow movie totally unwatchable.\n",

It has excellent music by Kalyanji Anandji with melodious songs. Feroz Khan has acted beyond expectations equally supported by both the heroines Hema Malini & Rekha. Has mega locations of Afghanistan, reminding one of the western cowboy movies. The movie keeps one engrossed right from the beginning till the end, there isn't any dull moment.

            "Released at a time when Mumbai (then Bombay) was making the transition into the cosmopolitan city it is now, this movie captured the angst of the educated but unemployed youth striving to survive in the big bad city. The movie also made bold statements against the nexus between the city developers, the mafia and the corrupt politicos. What makes Angaar different from most other bash-the-mafia movies is the strong characterization. Almost every significant character has dimensions.There is no pure hearted \"hero\" or mean-as-a-mule \"villian\" and the casting is perfect. Each actor fits the role perfectly. The story revolves around the House of Khans. The patriarch, Jehangir Khan (Kader Khan) is toughest Underworld don in the city and is now enjoying his retirement by solving issues of the poor folks in his \"Durbar\" (court).His younger son, Farid (Mazhar Khan) handles the daily affairs of the underworld empire. However, there is a lot of tension between Jehangir and his elder son, Majid (Nana Patekar, superb as always), who is an architect and runs a construction agency. Even as Jehangir tries to reform himself by helping the poor, the ruthless and stubborn Majid wants to raze down as many slums as possible and build skyscrapers.Meanwhile, we are introduced to Jaikishen aka Jaggu, who is a hot headed unemployed graduate and the leader of the brats in his small \"Chawl\" - Asha colony. One day, Majid happens to see Asha colony and immediately realizes that it is prime land. Majid politely asks Jaggu to clear the colony and promises to compensate for the relocation. However, Jaggu declines and then Majid decides to use his father's muscle power to grab the land. Matters complicate as Farid gets in a fight with Jaggu and dies of wounds. Jaggu is arrested and is declared mentally deranged because of his insane anger. Majid bribes the warden of the asylum and asks to torture Jaggu to such an extent that Jaggu becomes totally inert to respond. Meanwhile, Jaggu's friends - Hussain(Om Puri) and Mili (Dimple Kapadia) continue to expose Majid's and Jahangir's misdeeds through their newspaper. Jahangir repents and helps Jaggu escape from the asylum. Jaggu's friends help him recuperate. This causes panic in the Khan clan as now Jaggu can testify against them. Majid's machinations finally succeed and he razes Asha Colony to the ground. Jaggu and his friends avenge their colony by bringing down Majid's high rises and the movie culminates in an over-the-top, fantastic climax where the State assembly is blown away as a part of Jaggu's \"cleaning up the system\" plan. This movie has excellent performances by the entire top cast, notably, Nana Patekar, Jackie Shroff and Kader Khan. However, it is the finer touches which make this movie so different - Jaggu's nagging dad (Achyut Potdar, brilliant), Jehangir Khan's faithful bodyguard Anwar (Kiran Kumar, executes the role with great restraint, he doesn't even speak throughout the movie!!!), the honest-but-helpless Police Commissioner, the tense family dramas in the Khan household, Majid's retarded son and his self-pitying wife (Neena Gupta), Jaggu helping Mili to cross a busy traffic intersection - there are many more things to remember in the film. The film also has some good art direction with huge sets and some decent miniature work, which for a 1992 Hindi movie, was path-breaking. Today, after 12 years, the movie doesn't look slick - but the performances are top-notch, so is the script. Some may find the climax too fantastic, but hey, that's Bollywood for you!\n",

            "Its really great to see a comparatively small film exploring a novel idea trying to give you something fresh moving ahead than the usual. Hence SHARAFAT GAYI TEL LENEsurely earns few brownie points for this much desired brave move taking the risk, but I wish the team had shown the same inventive vision in its writing and execution too saving it from becoming a drag post the initial interesting moments in the first half.Sharing the outline of its exciting plot, just imagine what if the ATM balance receipt one gets out of the money machine surprisingly shows an amount of Rs.100 crores recently credited in the account. And next, the person still struggling to accept the truth receives a 'private number' call from none other than the notorious Dawood, who has actually depositing that money in order to have a new middle man in the town delivering his 'Havala' payments. Based on this energetic con-plot with a wide scope of many shocking twist and turns, SGTL sadly begins with the same long intros and a song before coming to its core theme. And then instead of becoming a fun-ride, soon loses the grip and goes on overstretching the proceedings missing that expected excitement or energy. Supporting the film to the best of their ability, everyone in the cast (Anupam Kher, Zayed Khan, Tena Desae & Rannvijay Singh) play their respective roles well but director Gurmmeet Singh fails to exploit the efforts made, delivering a completely lifeless film (with a poor climax) that could have been a fine, fast paced, thrilling entertainer instead. Moreover when you see the names of multiple music directors roped in for the average music to be incorporated in a con-thriller accompanied by an unexciting background score & cinematography, then you realize that probably the film was being conceived in the wrong manner right from the first stage itself missing the required focus.To conclude, the fresh interesting plot of a con-game being played between just a few characters (with reference of the over-famous Dawood), gets under-utilized in SHARAFT GAYI TEL LENE released without any publicity campaign. But it still can be seen (just for its enjoyable premise) if you are able to catch it next on a channel or post its release in the home video market in the coming weeks.\n",

            "\"BANDH DARWAZA\" may well be my personal favorite of the Ramsay Brothers horror flicks. It is in some ways the most approachable for non-Indian viewers. It's monster is a standard black cape wearing, fanged Vampire and the plot is fairly easy to follow, even without subtitles. The best part of the film is it's monster. There is nothing \"suave\" or \"seductive\" about this vampire. He's a MONSTER, plain and simple. Appearance wise, the vampire here sort of reminds me of Rondo Hatton with fangs and a cape. He's kind of a nightmare version of a cartoon Dracula, complete with black silk cape with high collar, very white fangs, and a fright-mask like face. But he's SCARY! Let me tell ya'! I'm a jaded horror film fan and this is one of the just plain nasty scariest vampires committed to film! His dialog consists mostly of \"Gnaaaaarrrrghh-sssss\", usually shouted while smashing through a wall or a door, or just stalking relentlessly toward the frightened protagonists. The closest American counterpart I can think of is the vampire from \"THE NIGHT STALKER\", all predatory beast with not a drop of Lugosi to speak of. But, at 2 1/2 hours long, the movie will try the patience of all but the most dedicated fan, and will probably send casual viewers running for their remotes. If you can stick it out through the song and dance numbers and the lengthy conversations, BANDH DARWAZA delivers with the chills!\n",

            "ULIE 2 is the story of a girl who is forced to compromise in order to climb the ladder of success in Bollywood. Julie (Raai Laxmi) is a successful film actress who has bagged the biopic of the late Sumitra Devi, the wife of power broker Ashwini Asthana (Pankaj Tripathi). Four months later, she converts to Christianity on her 25th birthday and then informs everyone by addressing a press conference about it. After the press conference, she goes to a jewellery shop where four goons enter to loot. They end up gunning down Julie. Julie is immediately hospitalized. ACP Dev Dutt (Aditya Srivastava) is given the task and he arrests the four accused in a few hours. But he fails to understand why on earth they would attempt to murder Julie when they have simply come to loot the shop. He approaches Annie Aunty (Rati Agnihotri), make- up artist and mentor of Julie, and she narrates to him how difficult it was for Julie to make it big in the film industry. What happens next and how ACP Dev Dutt finds out the truth forms the rest of the film.JULIE 2 is advertised like a sleaze fest but there are hardly any titillating scenes in the film. In fact, the first half is devoid of any such sequence, except a few shots in the title song, which is played in the opening credits. The scene where bullets are pumped into Julie in the first 15 minutes does intrigue. The investigation by ACP Dev Dutt is too filmy but makes for a nice watch. However, the flashback portions are not that great. In fact, there are too many tracks in the film – the investigation, Julie's rise and fall and rise in Bollywood and Julie's bond with the various men who come into her life. The whole bit is not put together well. Julie is shown to be desperate for love and is heartbroken when she realizes that all men just want to sleep with her. But suddenly in the end, she comes out as an anti-corruption crusader and it's very unconvincing. The entire Sumitra Devi track, which forms the major part of climax, is also childish and difficult to digest. The film ends all of a sudden and one wonders what exactly the point of the film was at all.Deepak Shivdasani's story gives a déjà vu of Madhur Bhandarkar's HEROINE [2012] and even THE DIRTY PICTURE [2011]. But overall, it's senseless. Deepak Shivdasani's screenplay fails to keep all the tracks in sync. In fact, it's all over the place. Deepak Shivdasani's dialogues are silly and 90s types, that doesn't work, even in mass centres in today's times. Deepak Shivdasani's direction is also dated. It cheats audiences as the promos and posters suggest loads of titillation. But instead, the film has just few minutes of lovemaking scenes and that too much later in the second half. Few questions remain unanswered right till the end.Performance wise, Raai Laxmi manages to put a good show. She has oomph and also acting wise, she is decent. She is one of the major reasons why the film is bearable. Aditya Srivastava is nice but offers nothing new. He's playing the same character that he plays in the long- running crime TV show 'CID'. Rati Agnihotri is alright and hams at places. Ravi Kishen (Ravi Kumar) is fine as a southern superstar. Pankaj Tripathi is the only one who plays his part with conviction. Nishikant Kamat (Mohit) does well but is an odd choice for a romantic hero. His track suddenly ends in the first half and it seemed like the director was desperate to culminate his scenes so that he can move on to Julie's next chapter. Sahil Salathia (Cricketer Vikram) leaves a mark in a cameo. Dev Gill (Atif Lala) overacts a lot and his character could have been quite interesting but the writing ruined it. Asad Khan (Ambani) gives a good performance. Anant Jog (Benefit Rao), Viveck Vaswani (Shanti), Dolly Mattoo (Julie's mother) and Yuri Suri (Julie's step father) are passable.Music is poor. 'Oh Julie' works as it's shown during opening credits. 'Kabhi Jhoota Lagta Hai' is forgettable. 'Kharama Kharama' is a very poor inspired version of 'Ooh La La' and 'Naino Mein Sapna'. 'Mala Seenha' and 'Koi Hausla Ho Toh' come almost back to back and are forced to give the film a sizzling touch. John Stewart Eduri's background score is dramatic. Sameer Reddy's cinematographer is simple. Asif Ali Shaikh's editing is nothing special. Tinnu Verma's action is too filmy for 2017 tastes. Ashley Rebello and Tanushka Kitt's costumes are glamorous. N Dharma Rao's production design is theatrical.\n",

This one is pretty much a movie of its own, but as a movie, I somehow felt that something was missing. The movie starts off as a quiet romance and later we are presented with a surprising twist, which turns the movie into a dramatic suspense thriller. The film is not entirely convincing though it has its share of good moments. This movie marks the debut of Esha Deol, the daughter of Dharmendra and Hema Malini. Esha is pretty and she dances very well, just like her mother did. She is not even close to being as beautiful as her mother was and she does not have her charm either, but in terms of acting she does a pretty decent debut. At times she really is way too serious but overall she is good. Aftab Shivdasani is solid as Aman, a guy who hopelessly falls in love with Esha without knowing of her past.

The daughter, friends, neighbors, -- everyone else -- gave stilted performances as if they were reading their lines. Fortunately, the daughter's performance got better towards the end of the film but the director should have elicited better performances from everyone unless that was their best and the casting crew would have to take the blame for not finding better actors. I would have preferred the over-acting of a lot of Hindi actors than some of the drivel and inane delivery that permeated this film.Despite my misgivings of Mitr, I will still give it a 6 because of Shobana's performance and look forward to seeing her in other projects of better quality.

Director Ashuu Trikha delivers a story of brutality & injustice with conviction, but an erratic Screenplay acts as a deterrent.'Koyelaanchal' brings to light the explosive story of the people who have kept our precious fuel station at ransom for centuries. It unveils itself through Saryu Bhan Singh, an ex-owner turned Mafioso of the region, who through his sheer brutality & blatant defiance of law of the land, forces the people & the authorities to acknowledge him as their 'maalik'. Any protest, any voice of dissent against him is dealt with spine chilling violence. But, things take a turn when an uptight officer comes in town & battles against the kingpin & company. 'Koyelaanchal' has an average first-hour, but a gripping second. The first-hour concentrates more on gruesome violence, which to be very honest, is off-putting. However, the second-hour is arresting & powerful. The confrontation scenes between the villain & hero, are solid, while the child abduction track, is well-handled, as well.The Screenplay is a mixed bag. At times slow, at times engrossing. A stronger screenplay was certainly needed! Ashuu Trikha has Directed the film with conviction. His handling of this disturbing subject, is indeed note-worthy. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is fairly done. Action-Sequences are very brutal. Performance-Wise: Suniel Shetty is in terrific form. He's tough when needed & also restrained when required. He triumphs with a super act! Vinod Khanna enacts the godfather like evil villain, with command. The veteran is fabulous. Vippino is effectively scary. Roopali Krishnarao is excellent. Ashuu Trikha, himself, shows up in a cameo. He's good. On the whole, 'Koyelaanchal' works in bits & pieces.\n",

            "I saw Yeh Hai Bakrapur on You Tube yesterday. Hadn't ever heard of it before. Surprisingly it came up on a \"latest Bollywood comedy full movie online\" search even though it released in 2014.Anyway I started watching, it held my interest and provided more than a small measure of humour, not to mention the human interest story.I loved the setting. Seemed to be on location in some dilapidated ruined habitation in rural India. I guessed somewhere on the Deccan plateau but the language was not of that region. Anyway, wherever it was, was very realistic.The story is of a little boy's goat Shahrukh (yes really!) that his family intended to sell to pay off their debts. A young male hairdresser who is romantically involved with the little boy's sister, saves the goat in an imaginative way that enriches the family ..... and the story continues ......Overall this is a nice film, beautifully shot, with a very different theme and well enough enacted by the largely unheard of cast. I enjoyed watching it and I wish it had better publicity. Yeh Hai Bakrapur is much better than a lot of the better promoted well known star cast mediocre fare that is churned out.\n",

            "So, here is Susi Ganesh who is overly confident of his 2006 hit Tamil movie (THIRUTTU PAYALE) that he tries his luck by remaking it in Bollywood. Playing the role signifying the title is our Neil Nitin(as Suraj). the film also has Ameesha Patel(Monica; continuing her dumb character in Race 2) and Puja Gupta(as Sherry; seen in GO GOA GONE). The movie is extensively shot in Mumbai and Kenya. In the entire hide and seek game between Neil and Ameesha, it's the viewers who get restless! There is no entertainment quotient or novelty either in the script,screenplay or dialogues. \"Main shola, tu meri Coca- cola\" are some of the types tossed at viewers. I wish I could actually think of loads of exciting parts in this sub-standard offering except an unexpected climax and a dishoom dishoom between Neil and poor tribals!!\n",

            "A real Indian farce on marriages. What a delight. Some crackling fresh scenes. It has caught the patterns of the pointless fights that husbands and wives have in marriages. Some of the scenes, like the fight over drinking and how much the AC temperature should be, are so real. In fact the very same Ac fight happens in my family all the time! The new comers are slightly rough -edged, but considering how wooden some newcomers had been - who have now become so called 'stars'- Jagrat Desai and Sasha Goradia seem highly talented. Vinay Pathak's reactions, specially his silent ones, when the two are squabbling are hilarious. It goes to the credit of the director, who incidentally is a 'woman' (remember Deepa Sahi of Maya Memsaab fame) that she has not taken sides and gone in for male-bashing, as one would have expected. The dialogs are spoken and not fake. The Himalayas look glorious. Right from the streams to the winding roads to the desert mountains, Christo Bakalov has done a wonderful job as a cinematographer. Sometimes the 'low 'budget can be seen. The song picturisations are weak But overall it is such a true and funny film that it is a must see.\n",

            "Lootere is an excellent (multistarrer) action movie with Sunny Deol as one of the three heroes, and that a cop too. The film is very well handled, and it has tons of mind-blowing action and thrills to keep you at the edge of your seat. Everyone does well in this film, and it is this aspect along with loads of action that makes this action flick worth watching. The story is interestingly told, and how the heroes save the day and vanquish the baddies is superbly done. Lootere is one of the best Desi action films of the early '90s. If you like to see nonstop action and thrills with lots of blood and gore, then watch this movie, especially for Sunny Deol. Enjoy!!\n",

            "There is not a lot new in the plot of \"Aaghaaz\". It's a pretty standard fusion of revenge drama + love story. What makes it worth watching is Suniel Shetty flexing his acting muscles - finally. Well, that and the chili powder scene referred to in the title of this review.Suniel has done a lot of these \"protector of the people\" roles but few allow him to act because few provide him a character with any depth. The character of Govind comes across as somewhat naive and simplistic in his uncompromising morality in the first half of the film. It is only after the intermission that Govind shows some layers. Suniel gives a solid performance in the 2nd half as a man betrayed by the unwillingness of neighbors he once aided to help him when he's in trouble. The scene when neighbors come to confront his legal tactics at his home is a demonstration of acting ability. Govind says nothing but the viewer can see what he's thinking, feel what he's feeling and understand his unspoken rage. It is a case of the writing, direction and performance being in sync. The very fact that he says nothing but commands the scene is marvelous.There is a somewhat anemic love story attempted. It is not compelling, partially because there's no preamble. The first time we meet the characters, they're already in love. The reunion at the end is not really satisfying.The songs are good but unremarkable. Production quality is reasonably good - lighting, framing and costumes\\set decoration all meet expectations.The scene with the chili powder is a fave of mine - Govind is wounded and takes refuge in a shop were red chilies are ground into powder. He takes a handful of the powder and smears it into his fresh lacerations and emits a scream of defiance and \"*$@#!% that hurt\"! His enemies realize how tough he must be and take off running only to be chased by chili-powdered, butt-kicking Govind. Classic! The only downside to this film is the somewhat graphic depiction of rape in full view of the public. It's a bit unsettling.But otherwise, watch it if you're a fan of Suniel or a lover of the wounded hero subgenre of Indian films. It's a satisfying ride.\n",

You know, like a schizophrenic...Mona Singh as the resident psychiatrist (she has only one patient, and the paycheck, if that patient is Sachiin Joshi, is enough to pay all her bills, and then some more)For most of the film, Joshi and Fakhri look very unhappy with each other. \"no chemistry\"..!The first half has a series of painfully awkward scenes including a dinner date outdoors that sees Fakhri act like an overgrown child. She's dressed as a femme fatale and runs into the woods, telling him to catch her as she plays hide-and-seek.The usual horror tropes like chairs rocking on their own, creaking doors and ghosts watching you as you sleep are all there. Does it startle you? No. Does it make you cackle? Yes. 'Amavas' is unintentionally funny instead of being scary..... ,.. mostly because Fakhri and Joshi are unable to breathe life into a string of lifeless dialogues.The movie has nothing new to offer in terms of a storyline. Bad acting, coupled with a flimsy plot makes this a wretched viewing experience.The VFX aren't shabby, but they are tedious. Watching a ghost turn into a flesh-eating, blood-thirsty beast with crazy eyes gets boring after it's repeated more than once.At one point, Fakhri's character Ahana frustratingly claims she doesn't understand what's going on in that castle anymore.

            "One such movie need to be made every year in the industry that has become a junk yard rather than being an art place.. At least 10 Directors like Mr Satyam, need to be given a chance to take Indian Cinema forward holding mega phones. Not just action cut copy paste movies but these realistic pieces are worth watching in Theaters every time they get a chance to be released. Away from the jazzy sets or action packed scenes. \"Bollywood Diaries\" made its path to in everyone's heart who knows what actually is art is. Only Sad part is the producers might have lost money, believing change in Indian audience. Mr Satyam \" You are no doubt one of those best directors in Indian Cinema\" A well justified title for the movie. I had to stop the movie in few scenes only to wipe my tears out which i might not have done anytime before. (I have watched around few thousands of movies but never stopped until and unless its a crap) With only a minimal casting, the way Mr Satyam brought out the feelings out were a magic. Would wait for more films from you sir.... All the best to the team. And I am happy to be the first Reviewer for your movie on IMDb. I promise to be the first one to write for your upcoming movies as well. You are such an inspiration.The final scene was just brilliant, with each character and adding the exact amount of essence by music to make you leave the theaters with a feel.

            "Sphere is a science fiction film that starts off with a tremendously fascinating story and ignores all of the possibilities that it entails. Four people (you know the drill  a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), a biochemist (Sharon Stone) and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber)) are flown out to the middle of the ocean on a top-secret missions (even they don't know where they're going). We would be just as confused as they were about the details of their mission if we had never seen the previews, but even though we already know what they're going to find out there, it's just as interesting to learn about the details of this ship that has been found on the bottom of the ocean, and that appears to have been sitting there for 300 years (well, okay, 288). The story keeps getting better and better as we learn that there is a hum coming from the ship, indicating that there is still something running inside it, and then even more fascinating revelations once we are taken inside the ship. There can be no doubt that Sphere contains some truly interesting and entertaining elements, and that things like the acting are just as superb as we would expect from such a spectacular cast, but as the movie progresses, we begin to realize how little the film is going to reveal. I can't say that I wasn't completely enraptured for at the least the first hour of the film, but there were just as many bitterly disappointing things about it as there were good things. Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, delivered absolutely brilliant performances in this film, delivering some of the best entertainment in the entire film by themselves. There is a mildly interesting but completely unconvincing ex-romantic tension between Sharon Stone's character, Dr. Beth Halperin, and Dustin Hoffman's character, Dr. Norman Goodman, that is there for little other reason than to complicate the lives of the characters as they try to solve the mystery of this undersea ship. (spoilers) It's really too bad that the movie completely falls on its face in the second half, because the first half of the film is excellent and undeniably entertaining. There's nothing like a bit of time travel and the suggestion of extraterrestrial life to keep you entertained, and it is definitely a great scene when we find out that the ship is a human ship. This is one of the many things in the film that really makes you think. The thing that makes a great film is that it inspires thought. This is probably the one thing that all of the great films have in common with each other. There are surely a lot of things about Sphere that really make you think, which is another reason that the first half of the film is so good. We see that it's a human ship, which opens a whole new area of possibilities for the film. Harry (Samuel L. Jackson) speculates on the fact that the last entry in the ship's log is an entry into an `Unknown entry event,' indicating that they will never reach the surface to reveal what they've found. There is also a possibly over-extensive excursion into the realm of the psychological element in the film, as the characters are all made to face their fears, some of which are not just your average fears, such as Harry's strange fear of finishing 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. The special effects are definitely nothing to brag about, but there are some interesting scenes that take place in the deep ocean, such as the death of Teeny Fletcher (hey, she's black, she had it coming, right?) in the midst of a mass of strange sea creatures, as well as the scene with the thousands of squid eggs. Weird looking things, I've wondered since I saw the film what kind of props they used for that scene. The conversation with `Jerry' is unfittingly childish, but there is definitely a significant element of tension introduced when Jerry gets mad, as well as the scene where Norman contemplated the implications of Jerry's expression of emotions, indicating his ability to get mad. There are undeniably a lot of interesting things about Sphere, and it surely has the power to entertain, but it goes off the track later in the film, maybe because it tried to answer too many of its questions. There are some unanswerable things in the film, and the movie deals with them by having the characters have a weakly-written discussion about their fears and questions, and their ultimate decision to `forget' what they know using the power that they seem to have gained from the sphere. While this answers the question of how it could have been an unknown entry event when they all made it to the surface, it's probably the weakest ending that the film could possibly have had. As a strange twist on the science fiction genre, Sphere succeeds, although only in the first half. Like Hollow Man, Sphere could have and should have been a much better film. The unfortunate fact about the film is that it contains a lot of very interesting and very entertaining things that are surely worth watching, but the disappointing ending almost makes them not even worth seeing.\n",

            "SYNOPSIS: Sam (Om Puri) is a single father raising his only daughter Pakhi (Sakshi) in Canada. As a consequence he is extremely protective of her and they share a very special bond. Sam's biggest fear is that his baby girl will have to get married and leave someday. He is of the firm belief that no man can love his daughter as much as he does. But unfortunately for Sam, his worst fears come true when Pakhi meets and falls in love with Samar (Priyanshu). Samar is a suspended cop who comes to Canada to solve some case which will prove his innocence. The rest of the movie focuses on how Sam comes to terms with the situation and accepts Samar as part of his daughter's life.REVIEW: APBKDH is Anubhav Sinha's second venture after Tum Bin. He returns to Canada for the setting. Believe it or not, this time he manages to capture the scenery even better than in Tum Bin. The story itself is inspired from Father of the Bride and Meet the Parents but thankfully this doesn't take from the merits of the movie. Mainly because Anubhav Sinha is a good storyteller. My only complaint about the story was Priyanshu's suspended cop track which was a little confusing and lengthy. Also the fact that Pakhi's family cut ties with him because of it is hard to believe. He lied, yes and they had a right to be mad but not kick him out altogether. The cinematography as I've mentioned before is breathtaking. The music however is disappointing. After Tum Bin, the expectations were high. The best song in terms of picturization and music is the title song. The rest are only slightly above average. Performances wise, veteran actor Om Puri takes the cake. Playing a worried, protective yet doting dad to the hilt, he is an absolute delight to watch. Priyanshu as the other pillar of the movie is also great. He has improved a great deal since Tum Bin. Here he gets to play a lighter character and gets to show us his action, comedy as well as romantic sides. He looks extremely handsome especially in all the trendy clothes he wore. Sakshi as Pakhi makes a decent debut. She looks pretty in almost every scene. Her best scenes are with Om Puri.BOTTOM LINE: Definitely recommended for Canadian scenery and the performances but mainly for the depiction of the relationship between a father and his daughter. Also the tug of war between Sam and Samar is fun to watch. Om Puri and Priyanshu are hilarious.Also I'd like to mention that the song 'Aisi Aankhen Dekhi Nahin' (I've never seen such eyes) should have been picturized on Priyanshu instead of Sakshi. His eyes are way prettier than hers.\n",

            "A taxi driver is dangerously obsessed by a horror movie actress. He travels to Cannes to convince her to star in the movie he fantasises he is going to direct. A series of killings start.On the face of it this is one of the many films from the early 80's slasher cycle. However, it's hardly typical of that genre. Sure, it has the usual slasher ingredients – lots of gory violence and lots of semi-nude girls – but overall the tone is quite different. There is a definite comic feel to this one. Much of that is down to lead actor Joe Spinell who plays the deranged taxi driver. Spinell is a good enough actor to make, what could easily be a very unlikable character, sympathetic. His interplay with his mother is also kind of funny and I suppose is a jokey take on the stereotypical mother-fixated psychopaths from these types of movies. Joe's delusional world view is illustrated with segments that blur fantasy and reality. We see him as a ludicrous tuxedoed famous director interspersed with the scenes of his grim reality. All of this stuff gives The Last Horror movie a definite difference from other movies with similar scenarios.The film also stars Caroline Munro as the famous scream queen. And she looks pretty striking with her black and white mane of hair. Interestingly she is making a movie called 'Scream' and this was way before Wes Craven came up with his post-modern slasher. In fact, you could argue that this very film was playing around with a few of the ideas that Craven would use over a decade later to great commercial success. After all, this is a film that playfully points out the conventions of the slasher film while still essentially delivering various methods of bloody murder. What was also pleasing was the way that The Last Horror film winds things up with a pretty decent ending that wasn't obvious. So, all in all, this has to be considered one of the more innovative slasher flicks of the 80's.\n",

Overall, you wont say that you wasted time or it wasn't worth it. It can be a good weekend watch if you are interested in 1980's Indian cinema. You cannot compare it with any Hollywood movie but Shekhar Kapur does a good job in bringing the reality of Indian villages to life, and what does it feel like to stay there with dacoits all over the place.Considering it is a 1989 movie, I'll give it a 7/10.\n",

            "By Swami Anand Kul BhushanSlow down. Press the 'pause' button of your non-stop mind when you start watching the new movie, Rebellious Flower, portraying the early years of the mystic master, Osho. Here is the unhurried, rustic and realistic depiction of the small village in Madhya Pradesh where he was born and grew up with his grandmother in a nearby village. No sets needed to be put up as the movie has been shot on real locations that are still almost the same as 60 years ago. The outdoor scenes send you to the clean and crisp air and vast horizons.How did Osho become the master of masters? Here is the answer based on his early life as an inquisitive and fearless child, a voracious reader and a seeker. As a chubby prodigy, Prince Shah, plays the part charmingly; then Shashank Singh takes over as a teenager. The resemblance to young Osho is incredible, especially the enigmatic eyes.His grandmother, played by Kirti Adarkar had a crucial role in his formative years by encouraging his prickly questions and supporting his quest. He was greatly influenced by three mystics, all of them played faultlessly by Mantra.The real challenge is to show how and when Osho gets enlightened on 21 March 1953. Very sensitively crafted, these scenes stay clear from showing a new glow around him with thundering music. Instead, it is very silent and plays with light. No histrionics here. Producer Swami Jagdish Bharti who wrote the script gave full freedom to director Ashok Hooda to present this true life story without any halo. Overall, this is a meditative movie that sincerely presents the childhood of an enlightened master. If you are looking for action, scandal and sensation, it is not for you. But if you want to break away from the mad, mad world for two hours and become meditative, go watch it.\n",

            "Small budget, experimental movies are more than welcome in the present scenario when the film business is largely ruled by the stars coming up with all routine projects. So from that angle KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI can easily be rated as a fairly decent debut attempt by the director Aman Sachdeva to recreate the look, feel & magic of films such as KHOSLA KA GHOSLA, DELHI BELLI, VICKY DONOR and FUKREY (all revolving around a similar backdrop).So following the same Hit pattern, Aman Sachdeva also makes his light hearted movie moving around Delhi only with mostly Punjabi & Haryanvi characters interacting with each other. Talking about two fast friends, stepping into their real life after passing the 12th exams, it showcases how one of them (Kuku) takes a wrong decision on a third person's advice and then later repents on the same, returning to his dear friend. Made on a familiar 'seen before' kind of base (with a unusual catchy title), the film does have its few moments and some good performances too coming from the fresh cast. But the problem actually lies in its too thin plot which remains unconvincing throughout as such drastic, senseless and criminal step is not insanely taken by a friend against the other for just a small revenge. Moreover a lot of time gets wasted in the beginning (almost 35-40 minutes), wherein the film has nothing to convey as per its storyline and it keeps showcasing their friendship only through various sequences. Further the criminal activities are performed with such an ease or confidence, without any moral fear or hesitation that it all seems to be too filmy to believe in.With a mediocre soundtrack, non-contributing background music and an average cinematography, KMKJHG actually just falls short of being as realistic as any of the Delhi based films mentioned above. Selecting an unusual title inspired from the local lingo, the accent sounds to be artificial most of the times and the next to door family kind of feeling is largely missing. Also the film keeps following its inspirational sources devotedly, which is clearly visible in sequences such as the Jagaran one, straight away reminding you of FUKREY.In the performance section, both Siddharth Gupta (Kuku) & Ashish Juneja (Rony) show their confident sparks in few good scenes and Simran Kaur Mundi is just OK with nothing much to do along. Pallavi Batra (as the actress) impresses, but also tries to be a loud clone of Parineeti Chopra. Siddharth Malhotra (Rony's elder brother),Brijendra Kala (as Baba Ji), Somesh Agarwal (Kuku's father), Anoop Puri (Rony's Grandfather) and Rajesh Sharma (Jagran Singer) add their own individual bit to this simple, social comedy. But its the enjoyable acts of Amit Sial (as Mama Ji), Alok Chaturvedi (as the Watchman), and the actress playing the watchman's villager wife, which actually make the film interesting enough despite having a quite non-existing plot line.In short, KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI is a light hearted comic film trying to impress that particular section of viewers who loved watching similar, recent entertainers like FUKREY. But scoring a lot less in comparison, it also strictly remains the one which you might enjoy more watching on a TV channel without making an effort or spending a good amount of money on its costly multiplex tickets.\n",

            "Rooks's 'Train to Pakistan' tells the story of a small Punjab village during the partition in 1947. There have been several movies on this subject but Rooks takes a different turn. I liked her direction and she really put effort into presenting the time and the horror of the war without flooding the film with graphic images and sounding preachy. Even if there are few such scenes they are used minimally. In one very effective scene we see corpses float on a river as the villagers silently stare. None of the bodies are shown from close range and yet the scene is so impactive. Some viewers have disapproved the use of foul language. However, I think it adds to the rawness of the hot-headed villagers. I haven't read the original novel (I didn't know it was an adaptation until afterwards) but many are disappointed mainly due of the lack of development). At some point, the film seemed to move at a sluggish pace until it swiftly picks up in the last half hour. Some characters did require development, especially Iqbal. Mohan Agase as the ignorant head of the village conveys the complexity of his character with complete ease especially in the scenes where he reflects himself as the man he he has become compared to who he used to be. Nirmal Pandey provides some comic relief. He's a little loud with dramatics but overall it's a good effort. Sadly, Rajit Kapoor's Iqbal suffers even though the actor makes the best of what he has. He seems to have taken his pants off for no significant reason as his character isn't given much scope. Divya Dutta does alright but the dubbing (clearly someone else's voice) does hinder the acting (as the voice sounds too childlike for a professional prostitute). Smriti Mishra is adequate. Much of the supporting cast were a little too dramatic. Comparisons have often been made between books and movies and usually books win. But, having not read the book (which I intend to) I was generally pleased by 'Train to Pakistan'. It could have been better but it's not bad. I liked the powerful ending as, without derailing from the main story, it avoided the 'cliched art-film' ending (I thought it would end with graphic images of the bloodbath).\n",

            "\"Zindaggi Rocks\" is a kind of a film that might appear interesting with its two-liner plot outline narration given to the actors or the producer. But when those two lines are developed into a 200 hundred-page screenplay it loses its impact and charm. That's because the screenplay could well have been completed in just hundred pages and the movie could have been half its runtime length making it more crispy and gripping. But a Bollywood filmmaker can't resist the temptation to cram the film with emotions, drama, romance, comedy and a dozen songs (even if none of it is mandatory) thereby hampering the actual essence.The movie opens with Dr Samir Rehan (Shiny Ahuja) being summoned by the police for some investigation. Don't ask why the cops summon him, because it is never explained in the film.The entire movie opens in flashback mode with Shiny's (or whoever has dubbed for him) emotionless and bland voice-over. Shiny is a doctor who falls in love with Sushmita who plays a rock star (well that's what we are forced to believe).But then the actual story of the movie begins when we get to know that Sushmita's adopted son needs a heart transplant desperately. And we get to know this only post interval. This means that there is no story in the first half at all. Just unnecessary and insipid scenes going on and on! Even in the second half, the film takes too long to deal with the core theme and wastes unnecessary reels on verbose dialogues, abstract poetry and redundant songs. If that's not enough there is also a romantic angle between the 10-year-old foster son and his classmate. Add to it some incomprehensible, metaphorical 'durkut raja' fables forced in.The major flaw in the film is that the emotions portrayed by the characters fail to connect with the viewer. While the film squanders a lot of time in the Sushmita-Shiny love story you still don't feel any chemistry happening between the two.A word of advice to the director ? just smooch scenes between couples doesn't ensure smooth chemistry. While Sushmita goes over-the-top most of the times, Shiny is as faded and expressionless as possible. Even the emotional bonding between Sushmita and her adopted son doesn't strike a chord with you. And what on earth made Moushmi Chatterjee do a double role as the simple and sophisticated sister, in a film where she was boring in both. While her Bengali accent is evidently irritating in her simplistic avatar, as the stylish tomboy sister she hams hysterically. Also why did the director want a wannabe cowboy character (Ravi Gossain) in the film? And what was Kim Sharma doing in the film? Inflicting more pain to the audiences' senses? Blame it to the lousiness of the director of the incapability of the actors but the performances in this film are plain below average.Another bone of contention is that why did the director Tanuja Chandra want Sushmita's character to be that of a rock star while the film's storyline doesn't demand anything of it? In fact even the film was promoted as if it was about the life of a rock star. Sushmita looks old in certain frames and despite having the charisma to pull off a rock star isn't used to her potential.The music is peppy at times but an overdose of it spoils it all. The background score is not at all in sync with the proceedings on screen. At many instances the scenes turn out to be unintentionally funny. Editing is as good as absent from the film.The instant hangover after watching this film would surely be Zindaggi doesn't rock. Rather it sucks. Let me not use any more rhyming words to describe the state of mind.\n",

            "I admire Sudhir Mishra. He is a huge talent and there is no denying that he also needs to be thanked for inspiring a generation of filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap who clearly benefited from his mentorship during AK's earlier films like Black Friday!But where I find Mr. Mishra falling short of true glory is due to his execution. His stories are usually intriguing but fail to cause an impact due to a general tepid visual style. I felt that with Hazaron Khwahishen Aisi and even more with this one. After watching IRKSN last night again (I had watched it originally when it first came out), I believe it may have to do with funding of his films (or lack thereof). The story itself is not novel in this day and age when every other film today that calls itself \"offbeat\" appear to have characters with \"shades of gray\" in them. The overall pace of the film is good and does justice to the story  but the production values and the economy of the shots are where the film falls short. In some scenes you almost can't help but wonder if the scene could have been a lot better with a retake or placing the camera a little differently! It can't be the actors since you have some of the finest talent here - Ashish Vidyarthi, Saurabh Shukla and the late Nirmal Pandey! Some scenes that are supposed to convey a sense of wealth and high society seem tacky that you would think you are watching a B-grade flick!I would watch this for the ensemble cast and acting (if you can ignore the tacky wigs and costumes that they don!).\n",

Out of EVERY movie i've seen i must say that Dulaara along with Khuddaar are both One of the Best movies! Govinda acted very well in this movie in which he is an orphan raised by Farida Jalal. It's just such a pity that this movie was not rated well enough, instead of being a HIT it turned down as one of the 'Ok/Good' movies but i strongly disagree with that decision, this movie deserved to be a HIT and still does, so regardless of what the outcome was for this movie i would still recommend everybody to see it. When and If you do see it you will realize how great this movie is and how much you enjoyed watching it. If you have not seen this movie yet then i would strongly recommend you to watch it! a true classic movie which cannot be missed!\n",

Yeh Dil Aashiqana is another example of an ordinary film given a boost due to their lifting music. The film had the standard story of 2 lovers who are separated but the treatment by Kuku Kohli makes it a better fare then expected. Least is expected from this film. The film has 2 plots running side by side. One is the college first half(just like PAK and Suhaag Kuku Kohli's earlier films) and the terrorist angle(Aditya Panscholi, Rajat Bedi) The film has a deja-vu feeling throughout but entertains at timesDirection by Kuku Kohli is abv average Music is the best part, I Am in Love, College ki ladkiyon and the final qawwali are awesome numbers.Karannath(2nd movie) is decent, Jividha Sharma looked okay and acted quite okay Aditya Panscholi is terrific as the villain, Rajat Bedi gives a sincere act, Aruna Irani(her 2nd production after ANARi No.1 both directed by her husband) does her staple diet role Johny Lever is forgettable\n",

            "Kora Kagaz is overall a realistic, simple and enjoyable family drama. The story itself, however, though handled with understanding and honesty, is nothing extraordinary and it has its share of unrestrained emotions. It is about a young married couple. She comes from a rich family, and he is a simple professor who lives a poor lifestyle with his aunt. She enters his house and the problems begin mainly because of her mother, who was never really happy with this marriage.The film stars Jaya Bhaduri in a fantastic author-backed role. She carries the film on her able shoulders, and is undoubtedly the main reason it works. There is something inevitably compelling about this pretty, petite and naturally gifted actress. She is always restrained and real, she never goes over-the-top, even when it is easier to do so, and rather than acting her parts, she inhabits them. And indeed, hers is an exceptional, nuanced portrayal that is replete with depth and maturity.Anil Ganguly is one film director who was probably keen on making meaningful mainstream movies, which had both the conventional ingredients of popular cinema and a fair share of substance. The authenticity with which Kora Kagaz portrays the complexity of marriage and relationships is appreciable, and at the same time it has entertainment value and mass appeal. It is overall a well-made Hindi picture of the 1970s, but Jaya Bhaduri makes it even better and a must-watch.\n",

            "Directed by the uniquely talented Mani Kaul, 'Duvidha' is a cine- story about a young couple marooned in the hinterlands of Rajasthan. Rajasthan is famous for its forts and palaces - but we don't see any of that here , in fact we see very less of the outdoors.The action lingers on, in an old white-washed house which cages a young lady (enacted by Raisa Padamsee). Even inside the house, we don't see much of her, swathed as her body is in a sari that is perpetually draped over her head. It's an orthodox household, made worse by the fact that this newly arrived bride is virtually abandoned by her useless young husband. Acceding to an auspicious time-period that mandates him to leave right then to a distant land to trade and make money for five years, he drily consoles his wife that once he returns after five years , they can have all the time and intimacy in the world to themselves.He's soon gone, but a ghost mimicking him to the fullest, takes his place by fooling the family with a seemingly convincing story. But it tells the young bride the truth. Will she accept this ghost as the perfect physical and mental impersonator of her husband for the next five years ?One suspects that even if Kaul had directed the same script with a conventional narration, he would have made an interesting picture for the full extent of its crisp 84 minute runtime. But then it might not have made the film uniquely memorable. So he would have thought - what techniques can I use to jazz up this narrative ? How can I do this without boring even the discerning viewer out of her or his skull?Of all the films I've seen, no other picture comes closer to simulating the effect of reading a comic book (a serious one) and watching a movie at the same time. Kaul subtly detaches video from audio almost always - the characters speak, but the dubbing is purposely left a little desynchronized while the voices are projected a little louder. There are no whispers or any barely audible talk in this movie. The camera, though very careful in aesthetics, is mofussil in its images with high-resolution pictures deliberately unreached for, and that coupled with the speech-bubble- like talk, heightens the illusion of perusing a work of graphic illustrations. Every sentence, with the requisite modulation of course, is like a declarative one. Irony abounds, the magical reality of folklore is tacitly accepted while chaste Sanskrit- centric Hindi is rich in redolence.Sometimes whilst the dialogues carry on, Kaul shows a static frame, and then switches to another. All this is done so artfully that it does not come across as gimmicky or disconnected - rather the images and the audio each register with crystalline impact. In an early scene of the ladies welcoming the young marital pair, we see a high overhead shot and then realize it is the best and the most vivid angle for covering the colourful different saris of the ladies all closely grouped together. There's a sequence of the un-named young bride enjoying a ride in a swing outside. But then she doesn't seem to be really enjoying it - the pallu of the sari covers her head like a dark funeral-sheet and her head leans sideways in dolor. The scene, coming nine years after a similar much more famous one, is a clear nod to Satyajit Ray's Charulata but Kaul shows, a short while later, another gesture in his doff of hat, when the angle of camera asks whether this woman on the swing is being hanged to death. As for the performances , their backbone is good, but finer nuances are obviated by Kaul's Bressonic approach where the actors are only required to be vessels at most, to convey the directorial plan. Folk vocals and local instruments are employed in inspired fashion to lend bracing underlines and mystic undertows. The tone of the commentaries in the film is equally riveting. Female or male, the dialogue sparkles with native purity and emotional perpicacity. The girl's voice, virginal in its innocence and plain texture, has less screen-time but is given a cutting little soliloquy where she says \" In the eyes of parents , a heap of rubbish takes more time to grow than the body their daughter ; I was barely sixteen when they began worrying about giving me away in marriage. I was able to flourish in my mother's womb but not in my father's courtyard\".The young male voice-over is utterly riveting the more one listens to it - please forgive the chauvinism in this as it is put to wonderfully quiet service - not cloying but utterly ironic - in honour of the martyred female's plight. The tone in this voice-over is gloriously inscrutable, as though it had died, and is now re-born and has remained young but omniscient, much wiser, a ghost virtually, but with the poignancy brimming over its seemingly nonchalant tone. Elocuting in splendidly pure Hindi, its achieves its finest moment when it soliloquizes on the bride holding her baby and climbing up the stairs to her husband awaiting in \"sweet expectation\" in the aftermath of an incident.By its beautifully subtle depiction of how a society treats its women and by its invigorating take on cinema itself, 'Duvidha' sculpts a compact but unshakeable landmark, not just in the Indian pantheon but also in world cinema. ***** More such @ Upnworld\n",

            "With a title like 'Summer 2007', I was expecting a typical coming-of-age film of the 'Dil Chahta Hai'/'Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na' sort but what I got was a surprise, a mostly pleasant surprise. I'm actually glad at how the misleading the title stays true to the film. 'Summer 2007' opens with a man setting himself on fire in the middle of a crop field. This is followed by three pot-smoking guys discussing nothing. Then, we are introduced to a hospital and learn that the three guys and two pretty women are med-students. The hospital drama reminds one of 'Grey's Anatomy' but after this sequence is over, it takes quite an unexpected turn that refers back to the opening sequence. The 4 frivolous students ask for a transfer (to attend rural service) in order to escape the school politics. With the expectation of enjoying the title summer in Goa, they insist on a placement nearby. Only the fifth student is determined to make a difference.Debutant director Sohail Tatari deserves credit for tackling a relevant, less talked about issue. He grabs the viewer's attention with the opening sequence and then cleverly introduces the five protagonists. The characters are fleshed out. During the first hour, Tatari spends quite some time for the audience to get to know the characters. All five are of distinct personalities: Rahul (Sikander Kher) is the 'head' of the group. Qateel (Arjan Bajwa) is a flirt who doesn't take anything seriously. Bagani (Alekh Sangal) is the horny one who desperately (but not too desperate) wants to get laid. Priyanka (Uvika Chaudhary) is sort of a bimbo with a heart. Vishakha aka Mother T (Gul Panag) is the down-to-earth girl with a mission, she's the conscience of the group.In the second hour, Tatari introduces the village. It is quite well presented and even though it is extremely poverty stricken, unlike the clichéd 'Gaon', here the villagers are indifferent towards the 'visitors'. They're not enthusiastic. They've seen too much and are too frightened to care. Then there's the village doctor who could care less about their arrival but he too has his needs and takes advantage of the situation.The film boasts of some very good performances but the lead man Sikander Kher does not impress. He seems too confused and he appears to experience great difficulty expressing Rahul's ambivalence. The three newcomers, Arjan Bajwa, Alekh Sangal and Uvika Chaudhary do a much better job. Vikram Gokhale springs a surprise in a new avatar. Prashant Narayanan is suitably menacing. Sachin Khedekar leaves a strong mark. However, it is Gul Panag and Ashutosh Rana who deliver the best. It's been a while since I've seen Rana perform so well and what a great 'comeback'. Panag seems to be making the right choice ever since the critically acclaimed 'Dor' and here she is simply outstanding.'Summer 2007' isn't without its share of flaws. Some scenes really drag on. Also the songs were totally unnecessary and the first one is quite awful.Overall, this film is very much worth watching. Tatari bravely presents an issue that one has only read in the newspaper or heard on the news channel and immediately forgotten thereafter. He does not throw the message in your face nor does he preach to us about solutions. He only shows us the situation as they are and how the fate of five medical students is affected by it. With 'Summer 2007' one can at least dedicate a few hours to these hard-working people just by understanding their pain and feeling for them.\n",

The other Lata-Rafi duet \"Tujhe jeevan ki dor se\" is also a memorable one. Above all, the direction is superb and carries a stark imprint of the master director who was coming on his feet to craft future hits like, Bawarchi, Anand, Mili, Abhiman and Namak Haram.Even though the movie is black and white still it was a box office hit.

All the important characters re-visit with forward extension to their characters.Storyline:: Hyderabad Blues.... happy ending. Cut to: Six years later. Varun (Nagesh Kukunoor) is happily married and running a successful call-centre business while his adorable wife Ashwini (Jyoti Dogra) is planning to start a clinic of her own. Sanjeev (Vikram Inamdar) and Seema (Elahe Hiptoola) have become proud parents of two which fuels fire to Ashwini for moving onto parenthood, while Varun detests the very thought. Varun recruits a new supervisor Menaka (Tisca Chopra). True to her name, Menaka carries husband-cum-boss stealing feat in her Curriculum Vitae, leading to chain of events challenging the very near seven-year-old-itch married life.Notable tracks which you would enjoy are Seema's new business venture, seduction tips from aunty and Varun's parents - typical.Heroines have been forte' of Kukunoor's movies - Juhi Chawla in 3-Deewarien, Perizaad Zorabian in Bollywood Calling, Nandita Das in Rockford, Rajshri Nair in Hyderabad Blues. This time its the turn of Tisca Chopra appealing enough to justify the vulnerability of Varun.Jyoti Dogra portrays Ashwini who is no match to the original Rajshri Nair. The new Ashwini appears pale and lacks conviction. Elahe' get a meaty-pie as a compensation to her blink-and-miss role in 3-Deewarien.The buzz word from Part I \"Dil Pe Mat Le yaar\" resurfaces here as a song - which even Menaka seems to be enjoy.As in all his movies, Nagesh strictly ensured devoting substantial amount of time and effort on scripting. At times he has tried breaking the Bollywood norms. The minute details are portrayed effectively. The movie is loaded with witty one-liner which aptly fit into flow of the movie.Go watch it - and if you don't enjoy then \"Dil Pe Mat Le yaar\"! PS: I sincerely hope his style is not corrupted by big production houses. Otherwise Mukta Arts carries the reputation of too much interference viz. Mukul Anand in Trimurti.

Sadly the film didn't even find a distributor and had to release directly on TV. The film is a mad comedy which wasn't liked at that time, it is as over the top, ridiculous as it can get but yet it entertains at most places The cast too was not happening at that time. The film has a decent plot, it's quite funny at many places, we have Saif who enters Mumbai to make it big but ends up as a peon and then he disguises as David Rathod to solve the solution. At times the situations are too farcical and also over the top which does get on the nervesMahesh Bhatt is never known for his comedy, his most comedy films except HHRPK, DHKMN were flops especially Duplicate. but here he does handle several scenes well. Music by Jatin Lalit is superb, the best part of the film though the songs do give a little jaded feel. Humko Awaz De, Mera Chand Mujhe, Teri Chaahat ke, all songs are fab The only footage used from Mr Aashiq are the songs, some of the visuals of the songs are from Mr Aashiq which shows in the film as the actors looks vary.Saif Ali Khan those days was struggling as a lead hero and gave very few hits but he always suited in comedy though at times he overacts yet he does a good job in his role Twinkle Khanna is okay in her role, she too didn't make it too big The best character of the film is Poplet, played by Girish Dhamija who is superb Saurabh Shukla is funny though he tends to overact Chunky Pandey, Akshay Anand provide funny cameos Avtar Gill(Bhatt regular) is superb rest are okay\n",

            "Ashwini Chaudhary's 'Dhoop' takes a look into corruption of the governmental system. Unlike the several other films about corruption in India, 'Dhoop' takes a different turn. There is no overt bloodbath sequence or dramatic scene where the hero takes the law in his own hands, none of that nonsense. What we see is the parent's struggle against the corrupt system to keep the memory of their son and the several other brave soldiers who were martyred.Based on a true story, Chaudhary's film starts at a slower pace but it gradually picks up. The screenplay keeps the viewer engaged as we see how the professor overcomes each obstacle and the sacrifices he makes. Music also contributes well. Jagjit Singh's Ghazals are beautiful.Performances are a standout. Om Puri and Ravathi are truly excellent. One cannot help but feel for these two strong characters. Their performances look very natural and both prove that they are two of the best. In her debut film, Gul Panag definitely holds her own and her next films like 'Dor' and 'Manorama Six Feet Under' further prove that she's here to stay. In a brief role, Sanjay Suri does well. However, he looks a little too old for the part.'Dhoop' tells a simple story of the common man's struggle against the system. The ending is slightly dramatic but the strong acting and the screenplay more than make up for the flaws. Definitely worth a watch.\n",

            "YKHRH tries hard to be a Bollywood equivalent to the likes of \"American Pie\" - but fails because the moral starts creeping into the plot fairly quickly. That ruins every attempt to make it a gross-out-comedy. Not that this is bad, of course. What remains is more a teen-version of the enchanting Aamir-Khan-Hit \"Dil Chahta Hai\". Or even closer: Bollywood's answer to the Israeli smash hit \"Lemon Popsicle/Eskimo Limon\" (1978).What's funny is that those two movies are essentially movies about male bonding and the search for women. Therefore they are considered films about men for men. YKHRH however might prove to be more successful with the ladies, mainly because of the cast. Prashant Chianani who plays Ranjiv looks straight out of a Playgirl-calendar and you sometimes get the feeling, the camera is actually making love to his body. The guy who plays Johnny is equally cute.That all is for the female audience to sink their teeth into - but the men shouldn't be disappointed. There's an attractive female cast, some crude humor and a nice message about male friendship. Not too bad either.Still, I wouldn't rate YKHRH too hight because with the exception of the first song, the music is highly average. The acting is so-so and the novelty factor rather low.

            "Dev Anand again plays the role of an anti-hero with a lot of restraint and deftness. A rare film, by Indian standards, where the heroine is shown falling in love twice. Wahida Rehman is initially in love with Vijay Anand, who, having gone abroad for higher studies, falls in love with another woman, and so does Wahida, who, after initial reluctance, falls for Dev Anand. The film is also notable for the fact, that in this film, all the three Anand brothers, Chetan, Dev and Vijay acted together. Chetan Anand gave an excellent performance in a cameo role of an Advocate, who fights for the reformed Dev Anand. With excellent screenplay and dialogues, the film showed the calibre of the young director, Vijay Anand, who was directing his second movie only. Another highlight of the film was its music by Sachin Deb Burman. Mohammad Rafi's \"Apni to har saans ik toofan hai\" and \"Khoya khoya chand, khula aasmaan\" are excellent numbers. Another good song by him is \"Sooraj ke jaisi golai, chanda si thandak hai paai\". His duet with Geeta Dutt \"Rimjhim ke tarane leke aai barsaat\" to date remains one of the best rain songs. Asha Bhosle's solo \"Sach hue sapne mere, jhoom le O' man mere\" is one of her best songs. Her duet with Manna Dey \"Sanjh dhali, dil ki lagi\" is a typical experimental number by Burman da. The film also has a beautiful bhajan in \"Na main dhan chahun, na ratan chahun\", sung by Geeta Dutt and Sudha Malhotra.\n",

May be you don't agree with its ending but still it was able to make you see every second of it and My Birthday song will just do that . The director is commendable for his effort and execution of the movie. Sanjey Suri is good and so is Nora Fatehi and she just look beautiful.

            "Indian Film industry does have something more to offer than Bollywood- sing-n'-dance-in-unison flicks! Mind you, Indians used to make politically and philosophically challenging profound films several decades ago. This film, I repeat, is NOT bollywood. What a relief. KP is the leading charactor who wanders about Bombay saerching for \"value\", I think. He has four main contacts, one with a little girl Didi whom he cherrishes like his sister, another with a female TV presenter who's hosting a expose program \"split wide open\", and yet another with a nice Catholic priest, finally with a mob who sells water. All four lead us to a different story, each intertwined together. Each contact represents a certain set of value, and KP struggles to find out what is truly valuable. You have to see for yourself what he finds at the end. This film says that there isn't such thing called pure value. Profound love, wisdom, realism, tradition, post-modernism, violence; \"ha-ha-\" to all of them. Since I'm not an expert in acting and filming, so I won't comment on them. But the strong message must be rated 18. Can you refute?\n",

            "Horror genre no longer carry the stigma of a B-grade outing delivering ample skin show under the hoods (yup, read that Ramsays). Thanks to continuous patronage from industry stalwarts like Ramgopal Varma and Vikram Bhatt who elevated the genre to a different level. Over period of time the horror genre has developed a substantial fan-base in India and movies like \"Kaalo\" precisely caters to this niche audience. Using darkness is a standard scare tactic in any horror/ slasher movie. The USP of \"Kaalo\" is the ability to send the shiver down the spine in the broad daylight (the term \"scaring the living daylights was never so apt!). This in itself deserves a big kudos!!The characterisation of \"Kaalo\" bears resemblance to quite a few. The underground movements are akin to \"Screamers\". The flight and swoop is inspired from \"Jeepers Creepers\". In close-up it bears similarity to \"Darth Maul\" (hey, no complaints!!). Introducing \"Kaalo\" to the audience seemed rushed. And yes, the weapon used by \"Kaalo\" is quite unique. The sepia tone neatly blends into the deserted sandy backgrounds of Rajasthan. Camera work is one of the important tool in horror movie and in the case of \"Kaalo\" the DOP has done a fine job. Background score is kept at optimum level not loud or jarring. The CGI adequate considering the budgetary constraints. The editing gives a slick feel to the movie though there was scope to calibrate it at few places. And yes, attempting Indiana Jones to recover the cap and the ball of wool when your pants are on fire was silly. The only major shortcoming I found was the lack of depth in the characters. For instance the protagonist barely has an introduction. The honeymoon couple & the photo shoot couple hardly strikes a chord with the audience. Same with the priest and the rest of the star-cast. Coen Brothers/ Guy Ritchie/ Tarantino have displayed histrionics in this regard and our very own Ramgopal Varma/ Vishal Bharadwaj/ Anurag Kashyap have pushed the envelope.Performance wise Swini Khara was good. Its good to see the \"Cheeni Kum\" girl after a long gap. I consider Aditya Shrivatsava to be a powerhouse of talent and found the potential was not tapped. Aditya Lakhia was okay'ish. The Laloo accent conductor linger in the head for a while. Paital as usual was dependable. Lack of publicity made \"Kaalo\" get lost in incognito (sad!). Nonetheless a definite watch for a horror enthusiast! Looking forward to your next outing Mr. Wilson Louis.PS: Its \"Bombay to Goa\" on the road to hell!!\n",

Vinod seems to have stumbled upon a book and the plot very much akin to desi version of James Hadley Chase. Not only the plot, the screenplay, the dialogues and the narrative resembles a book. Add to that the plastic performances of the actors namely Sherlyn Chopra, Deepshika & Harsh Chayya, the end-result is a B-grade lookalike. Only Deep Raj Rana manages to put up a convincing show. However navigating the hunter to fall into the lap of the hunted is extremely lame. The supposedly smart conversations between Sherlyn and Deepshika is perhaps the lowest point of writing.

As the film ends, you wonder if the filmmaker justifies adultery, prostitution and exploitation of women in general, including the casting couch.

            "Before he started making Bacchan blockbusters, Manmohan Desai had a try with many other good actors as well, namely Shammi Kapoor (\"Bluffmaster\") and Rajesh Khanna with this movie (\"Saccha Juttha\") amongst others.There is a nice plot here and you can feel the Manmohan Desai touch throughout. Rajesh Khanna plays in a dual role, as a simple-tom who comes from a village into Bombay to make it big but instead falls upon his conniving double. A lot of intrigue and also good acting from Rajesh Khanna (who won a Best Actor for this film) and Mumtaz.But to me, the voice of Kishore really steals the whole show, namely in the song \"Meri Pyaari Behena\". Kishore really transcends himself here and the end product is nothing but pure magic. Maestros Kalyandji Anandji are also to be commended for the composition, but the sincerity that Kishore brings to the song is nothing short of breathtaking. Not that Rafi and Lata did not have good songs (the duet \"Yuhi Tum Mujse Baat\" is spellbinding), but you have to understand that, at that time in his career, Kishore had reached almost perfection in his voice.\"Saccha Juttha\" is a must for movie lovers with a keen ear for melody.

            "Behind the misleadingly sappy title lies one of the decade's most positive and humorously enriching films. On the surface, the story is about the post-war housing shortage and the difficulties returning vets had in trying to start a family in old trailers, quonset huts, or whatever lodging could be slapped together. Peggy (Jeanne Crain) is a charmingly spunky newly-wed whose husband (William Holden) is in college on the GI Bill. There she meets stodgy old professor (Edmund Gwenn) and tries to talk her way into making his attic a new home for the couple and their expected baby. The trouble is Gwenn has turned his big old house into a mausoleum in tribute to his dead wife. Now he lives alone, in despair. Having completed his life's work he sees no further point in living and thus looks forward to suicide. In the process, however, he fails to factor in the life-affirming powers of youthful zest, old-age wisdom, and the wonderfully spirited Peggy.What a fine piece of obscure film-making, from scripter-director George Seaton and the cast of three principals, though Crain is a bit much at times. The film must have cost about 50 bucks to make since nearly all the scenes are indoors, but seldom has movie-making money been better spent. Beneath the post-war plot, there's a parable about generational sharing in which each age group brings uniquely enriching benefits to those around them. Thus, Peggy brings hope, joy, and a real home to the others, while husband Holden, though sometimes wayward, brings dedication, hard work, and finally a sense of real values. And as the ivory-tower professor, Gwenn contributes from the wisdom of the ages, but also finds that true philosophical thinking lies not on the dead pages of old books, but can also be found in the unlikeliest of places-- in a launderette full of seemingly empty-headed young wives. That superbly humane scene alone is worth the 90 minutes of watching.A movie like this could have gone off-track in so many places. The material alone might easily have slid into the sort of tear-jerking treatment that would send me running for the off-button. But never do the on-screen results descend to a sappy level. Instead Seaton and Co. maintain a consistently light and intelligent touch throughout, even during the darker passages. In fact, they accomplish one of the most difficult of all challenges inside an industry where cynicism is the norm and sneering is the response to any hint of idealism. To its great credit, the film actually makes us feel that beneath our differences, something like a harmonious human community may exist after all, as the wonderfully metaphorical last scene suggests. I expect a little project like this with its unfortunate title passed quickly into movie oblivion. However, now more than ever, Apartment for Peggy needs rediscovery. For its well-delivered message is truly trans-generational.\n",

            "As Enemmy begins we see a meeting of builders who pay protection money to a powerful criminal named Mukthar Memon (Zakir Hussain ) in an almost obligatory fearful manner. The film's plot deals with the unexpected disappearance of this cache of money, 500 koka's to be precise, on a Raigad Highway which is ambushed by an armed and highly skilled foursome. The anxious don in an act of madness goes on a rampage suspecting his competitive mafia top bosses and begins a gang war in the city. He wants his money back and will go to grave lengths to take it even if this means bringing the city to a standstill reflecting very poorly on the government in power. Director Ashu Trikha showcases how bloodshed can be a result of cunning moves from higher ups or officials almost like leading lambs to slaughter. The men instructed to handle the case are headed by Sunil Shetty (Eklavya Karmarkar, fondly known as Bhau), who we see return to a role he is most comfortable in and that's full blown action. He plays the cool, suave and calm plain clothes leader of the special Unit 9. It's been a while since we've seen Anna in action which almost makes me forgot what made him a star back in the 90's. He comfortably jumps straight into the action with a raid on the Don's hideout, based on information from our 2nd Unit member and planted mole in Mukhtar's gang, Mahaakshay Chakraborty. The other 2 support roles are played by Kay Kay Menon (Naeem Shaikh) and Johnny Lever (Eric Collaco). Amongst a group of actors so diverse and talented I thought it would be an uphill battle for a youngster to shine. Given a meaty role, Mahaakshay has stood the test, with full marks on the emotion and definitely above average in the action. What i admired most about the portrayal of Unit 9 was the realistic and raw feel of emotion and camaraderie amongst the officers. 'Brothers of the sword' of sorts, whether it was the maturity of a boy to a man in the size of his pegs or an accusation being filed each man backs the other up. Unit 9 functions like the 3 musketeers except there are 4 of them. They are best of friends personally and professionally. Unity is strength here as well as all for one and one for all is the spirit amongst them. Eklavya's friendship with Naeem goes back to their childhood days a bond which is strong and powerful. Mukhtar the Don is now behind bars but the gang war continues, with a reputation and possible votes at stake the Centre decides to send in a specialist. Throwing gasoline over an already raging fire and in enters Mithun Chakraborty as Yugantar Sharma to temper the situation in Mumbai city. Here's where the twist in the tale takes places as he soon realizes who those 4 masked bandits are and the cat and mouse chase begins. Unit 9 here are the perpetrators and the investigators. It's always a treat to watch Dada on screen, the most underrated cinema legend in his own right I thoroughly enjoyed how he cracks the whip singly on each member of Unit 9. The story boils down to an intense police drama with a mixed bag of emotions from belonging to distrust to the literal taking a bullet for a brother. A sensational shootout results in the killing of Naeem Sheikh (KK Menon) as well as members of the don's gang in the cross fire. A vast array of emotions are showcased here from internal confusion, shock and extreme anger. Members of Unit 9 reach the spot to see their fallen comrade. Grief plus arguing with CBI man Yuganthar Sharma begins and from a blame game this develops in to a quest as the men now are determined to get justice for the killing of their fallen comrade. The matter at hand and prime focus is to bring to justice the dreaded Don. The story may seem cliché at points from the use of clandestine detective tricks, unnecessary over running of lines, a horrible item number to an I've Seen This Before ending but all in all it's a more emotional take on a cop drama that i can remember in recent times. I've definitely seen better work from Zakir Hussein in the past and feel he's better with a menacing touch than a tapori don! Johnny Lever has been underutilized and should have been allowed to provide some comic relief. At times he looked caged. All in all it's a cop drama that keeps you intrigued and entertained till the very end. Enemmy throws light on a Mob-Police-Political tainted System and a dangerous nexus plus how the 3 of them co-exist and flourish side by side each feeding off the other. From the Top to the Bottom how corrosion of conformity exists and how anybody could do anything for a price as well as ambition. The enemy is truly within us and society's weakness is reflected and a can of worms is opened up. How has corruption, taking the easy way out and the greed for money eaten its way from law enforcement to leadership is what the film asks You? The film also shows several actors and characters in their own space and is intriguing with its numerous twists and turns. Enemmy throws light on various serious issues. Why would those who upkeep the law resort to stealing or robbery? The film showcases the grave steps officers take to make ends meet and protect their loved ones. Truly a multi starrer with suspense, action and exposing a sordid system which confronts all of us. A sign of the times! Is Material greed and wealth the only solution to your problems? If you're rushing into theaters to be entertained like I do then this is definitely worth a watch.\n",

            "I can't believe that such great films as Mrinal Sen's Khandhar are so little known among Indian audiences. This wonderful small film proves once again that you need not invest tons of money to make a great picture. I do admit it has little entertainment for the wide audience, but despite being slow in pace, it remains an interesting, deep and profound episode about one young woman who lives with her ill mother in the ruins. Her name is Jamini, and her prospects to settle down are doomed as her fiancée married another girl in the big city. She does not know how to notify her mother about that, but she gets a new hope as she meets Subhash, a young and single photographer who visits the ruins as part of his job. Khandhar is brilliantly scripted, and it's throughly authentic and real. Sen's direction is excellent. The camera work is very simple and the background score, though limited and is there only in crucial moments, is fantastic. This creates a successfully dark dramatic tone and contributes to the film's stark realism. I still think the film is beautifully shot because it captures the rustic rawness of the village. The antique sets look quite exotic, which may explain why Subhash is interested in taking there some shots.Shabana Azmi is excellent in a superbly understated performance which cannot get more realistic, and even naturalistic, than that. The reason her portrayal is so good is the fact that most of it is internal. In many ways it reminds me of her landmark role in her debut movie, Shyam Benegal's Ankur. I love the way the character of Jamini was written. She is a dedicated daughter, who is frustrated because of her tough everyday reality, her being unmarried, and her mother's illness and nearing end, which she has to deal with practically all alone. This very reality makes her angry at life and consequently we get to see some of her more negative and grayish shades. But then we are also presented with several moments which show her very soft inside. She is at times unlikable, but is always easy to relate to. Azmi delivers this mix with great conviction, and I can see why she herself considers this performance as one of her most accomplished. She is of course supported by a host of talented actors. Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapoor are both equally great, giving two restrained performances, while Gita Sen, as the tormented and ill mother, is very impressive despite lying on a bed throughout the entire film.The film scores big time in its portrayal of the mother-daughter relationship, which is amazing. This is mainly because Sen makes it as real and genuine as practically everything else in this film. It's not just bright; as opposed to famous typical Hindi films about dedication and sacrifice, here we see its dark side too. Jamini is a loving and caring daughter, there can be no doubt about that and it's pretty evident throughout the show, but there are also many moments in which we see her getting angry with her weary mother and at times even being a bit harsh on her. She is of course quick to apologise, and here we once again see that it's her daily struggle which makes her act unkindly at times. I suggest you to note the scene in which her mother acknowledges her as her best child for being her only support in her old days, and an excited Jamini tearfully hugs her beloved mother and utters the best lines ever: \"My good mother! My dear mother!\" Every time I watch this scene, I get a catch in my throat. Another powerful scene which shows the most intense argument between Jamini and her mother is of course in the penultimate scene, which is also unforgettable, but for that you will have to see this magnificent piece yourself.\n",

He lands both at a mechanic's shop, owned by Lalaji (Jagdish Sethi). However, he's fallen in love with Lalaji's daughter, Nikki (Shyama), and it doesn't go over well with her father. Based on a reference he received from a jail-mate, he ends up instead working as a cabbie again, but his new \"employer\" is shady, and also employs another woman who has fallen in love with Kaalu. When Kaalu's new employer tries to involve him in a heist, Kaalu is faced with a number of dilemmas.This is one of my first forays into classic Bollywood cinema. My previous exposure to Bollywood has been primarily through newer horror and thriller films, along with the occasional modern musical. I mention this because it will be difficult at this point for me to say much in the way of comparison/contrast with other relevant Bollywood films; I'm still on the upward slope of the learning curve.What I can say is that I enjoyed Aar Paar quite a bit. Like many Bollywood films, it spans a number of genres from musical and romance (of course) to crime, action and thriller. Dutt (who also directed and produced the film) and cinematographer V.K. Murthy seem to have been heavily influenced by Hollywood film noir here--their crisp black & white photography often features strong contrasts and heavy shadows, with pitch black darks and blindingly white highlights. But even though that style of cinematography is present throughout, the noirish crime/action/thriller plot points aren't very much the focus until the very end of the film.Aar Paar is much more about romance, especially romance that is not reciprocated, or that causes familial problems. On this end, it is intriguing and frequently funny, with much of the relationship development occurring in beautiful, harmonically complex songs (sometimes the disco-like rhythmic repetitions of modern, Bhangra-influenced Indian pop and film music drive me crazy--it was nice to hear music in an Indian film without overly simplistic, unimaginative percussion).Kaalu is an intriguing character. While he seems mostly a victim of circumstance, there are twinges of a shadier side that continually show through his adopted exteriors. A lot of the tensions in the film arise through two competing milieus trying to bring out one side or another of Kaalu's personality. Nikki and her family represent his sweet, innocent side, while his underworld \"boss\" and his lackeys represent a seedier, more hedonistic side. It's interesting that both sides have beautiful women attempting to lure Kaalu into their realm. In between the two we have Elaichi Sandow (Jagdeep), a \"street urchin\" who fulfills a function something like a guardian angel.The least successful aspect of the film was the aspect that provoked me to watch it in the first place--the crime/action/thriller material. Dutt and scriptwriters Nabendu Ghosh and Abrar Alvi provide inadequate exposition and staging to convey the gist of the heist plot. Later, during an extended car chase and shoot out, there are editing (and possibly coverage) problems that make it frequently difficult to discern the action. This material isn't a complete failure, but it's not nearly as gripping or suspenseful as it should be. However, as this material is only a small segment of the film, and the other aspects of Aar Paar work extremely well, the slight problems did not bring down my rating very much.The crime/action/thriller aspects may have been realized more effectively if they comprised a larger percentage of the film. Dutt almost gives the impression of having to tack them on, perhaps because of a studio that demanded something similar to the noirish American films had recently become popular worldwide.In any event, Aar Paar is certainly a success overall. Dutt gets maximum mileage out of a couple relatively simple sets, interspersed with a few driving scenes (mostly process shots). The performances must carry the bulk of the film for its two-hour length; they do so easily. Aar Paar is well worth watching as an example of the work of one of Bollywood's important \"classic\" directors.\n",

            "B.R. Chopra's Insaaf Ka Tarazu is a gripping, thrilling and brutally honest story of rape and injustice. Chopra's direction is great, and the script is very well written and disturbingly real in its depiction of the subject matter, an issue which has always been a taboo in a conservative society like that of India but which is also inevitably relevant. Zeenat Aman plays Bharti, a young hot model who lives with her young sister, a schoolgirl named Neeta, in Bombay. Bharti gets raped by one of her die-hard fans, namely Mahesh. Bharti seeks justice in court but fails to prove his guilt given the lack of evidences, and he is exonerated. A frustrated and deeply hurt Bharti loses her job, separates from her fiancée Ashok and finds a new job as a typist in Pune. Two years pass by, Bharti's sister is now a more grown girl who goes for a job interview as a secretary, where the manager is none other than Mahesh. And history repeats itself.Insaaf Ka Tarazu is poignantly unsettling and the courtroom scenes are effective. Chopra portrays the rape scenes in an incredibly realistic way, all the more so for those times. If the first scene shocks you with its authentic brutality, the second one will leave you wordlessly disturbed. It is sad to know how helpless a woman can be and even more sad that no one can come to her rescue. The proceeding dialogues do appear a bit melodramatic at times, but for a change this melodrama is so justified in this case that nothing really seems overdone in this film, and they eventually manage to make sense and impact. The film is not bitter, and though the law seems to be portrayed as somewhat stereotypically dumb and at places, unfortunately we all know that in many ways it is, especially with such crimes as rape. Aside from the direction and the writing, the film is aided by good editing and cinematography, and some very nice songs.If there is one aspect that makes the film as convincing as it actually is, it is the acting. Needless to say, it is Zeenat Aman's film all the way, and her performance in this film is definitely one of her career's best. She is very graceful, compelling and moving, acting naturally and looking absolutely gorgeous and awfully attractive (appropriately so). A very young Padmini Kolhapure is terrific as her naive sister who is forced to instantly grow up after going through the same traumatic experience. Her impulsive acting in the rape scene is powerful and her subsequent scenes are well acted. The relationship between the sisters is well brought out on-screen, and the two ladies must be given credit for this. Raj Babbar as the villain is quite good. Deepak Parashar is great as Ashok, Shreeram Lagoo and Simi Garewal play the conflicting lawyers brilliantly, and Iftekhar is excellent as the restrained judge.Insaaf Ka Tarazu has a much stronger first half as it is much more freshly chilling and interesting. The courtroom sequences are particularly good, even though not always do they ring true and at times they look a bit typical and theatrical. The second half does look a bit repetitive, but it is still involving. The film's ending is sadly sugarcoated to the max, yet it is satisfying and would certainly be accepted by lovers of Hindi films, as would Zeenat Aman's philosophical monologue in court. Despite being, as mentioned above, honest, Insaaf Ka Tarazu is not the most convincing film dealing with rape, but having said that, as a film it is still different, bold and enjoyable, and it shows the two faces of justice maybe not accurately but efficiently. With good performances and an engaging storyline which conveys a very critical and relevant message, the film manages to work and ultimately leave a mark.\n",

            "Saw the movie few days back, as i heard that this movie won a National Award , so finally i decided to watch the movie, the movie was excellent in every way. The movie starts off with the Mugal Ruler banning the music as he believed that music departed the person away from god. Then comes Waris Shah( Gurdas Mann) looking for Guruji, who teaches music at the secret location, when Guruji and Waris Shah meet, Guruji tells him that he is talented but he needs the pain in order to write the Heer, so Waris goes to the other village ( where the music isn't banned) to gain further knowledge about the music. When the Mugal Ruler finds out that Guruji is teaching music, he is killed. In the new village Waris Shah meets Bhaagpari(Juhi Chawla) who falls slowly falls in love with Waris, Warish also falls in love with her as well. On the other hand we have Saabo( Divya Dutta) who also is attracted to Waris Shah as well, and she is willing to do anything to make Waris hers. Saabo tires everything that she could think of so she would be able to depart Waris and Bhaagpari.Later on Bhaagpari is forced to merry Saabo's brother (Sushant Singh.Waris Shah realizes that in order to complete his Heer he must let Bhaagpari go so he could feel the pain that his Guruji said that he needs in this writing. Performance wise Gurdas Mann is natural as if the role was made for him and can't really think of anyone else Gurdas Mann in the role of Waris Shah, but he does tend to over act in few scenes and the aging does show as well. Juhi Chalwa is excellent and takes full advantage as what she is given, the role doesn't demand much but she does shine the marriage scene and Zeher scene. The real star of the show has to be Divya Dutta, who as the supporting outshines everyone as Saabo who has been rejected by Waris Shah and has shades of grey to her character.She has been given more footage then Juhi chalwa and she takes full use of what she is given and I might not be wrong to say this is the best performance after Veer Zaara. The scene where she tries to seduce Waris Shah or the Scene where she steals the \"Heer\" is outstanding. Sushant Singh is OK not award worthy. Mukesh Rishi doesn't have a role to talk about. The songs are average the pick of the crowd has to be Ve Kabootra Ve Kasda, Khaas Shamma Ajj Tere Lai , and Couplets Of Heer. The sets are grand as well which is really rear in Punjabi movies. Overall its a great movie and its worth your time .\n",

This is a very well made movie and deserves a lot better rating.Like I said, Ketan Mehta has always impressed me with his exclusive style of film making. Sort of similar to M Night Shyamalan in US. You never know what to expect. The movie is fast paced, the director wasted no time in useless song sequences, unlike other Hindi movies where it seems like director just turned on the camera and went to doz off. The casting is superb! Jakie Shroff is excellent.Well worth a watch. I seriously recommend this!!\n",

            "Phool Aur Patthar is an extraordinary film mainly due to its striking, realistic message. It has bits of everything, and it shows many human values anyone of us may have. It also has a fine portrayal of society. The society is presented in both bright and dark sides in this film, though not in a way that can be called positive. A commonly hated and infamous thief, Shaka, who comes to rob a well-known family, finds himself saving the life of a young ill and dying widow, Shanti, who was left to die by her in-laws during an epidemic. She has been long maltreated by her in-laws, and when they come back home, they discover to their surprise a healthy Shanti. Her brother in-law tries to rape her, and that's how Shaka takes her to his home. There the real story of coping begins for them. Shanti, an extremely religious woman, tries to help Shaka to make amends. The entire street is gossiping about the two and about Shanti in particular for entering the house of an infamous criminal.This is a touching story. The main hero has become a thief and a criminal not because he wanted to, but because he was forced by circumstances. The film shows humanity in so many instances and in an amazingly delicate way. It shows how cruel people can be. Shanti's own family leaves her to die while a criminal is the one who actually saves her life. After a few months of living together, Shaka understands he cannot live without her. Shanti's modesty, honesty and intelligence all make Shaka understand that he has found the first true love of his life. Even his pickpocket friend, Kalicharam is charmed by her attitude. I still remember the scene when he first meets her and asks her what he can do for her, and she answers, \"nothing, brother\". He breaks into a big laugh as he never heard anyone speaking so fondly to him. I was deeply moved by this scene.The performances are wonderful and every actor contributes to the film in his own way. Dharmendra, in one of his finest performances, is restrained and serious. No songs are pictured on him, and it contributes to the intransigent and tough features of his character. Meena Kumari is wonderful as Shanti. There is no doubt she is one of Hindi cinema's greatest actresses. She is graceful and dignified, and though she cannot be called beautiful (that was the time when she began gradually losing her good looks), she is presented as the epitome of goodness and Indian feminine simplicity, which is aided by her natural acting and excellent line delivery. Shashikala, as Shaka's lover, is extremely beautiful and vibrant. She is the complete opposite of Meena Kumari in this film: westernised, bubbly, at times unkind and always attractive. While the entire film shows her as a woman who is just sexually attracted to Shaka, we later find out that she really loves him. Ram Mohan as Kalicharan is hilarious with his comic sense. Lalita Pawar is great as Shanti's evil mother in-law.The film has many dramatic, romantic and comic sequences, all of which are very memorable and moving. The music, composed by Ravi, is just out of this world, and Asha Bhosle sings exceptionally every song. Her rendition of \"Sheeshe Se Pee\", which is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, is outstanding. Other songs such as \"Sunle Pukar\" and \"Zindagi Se Pyar\" are also brilliantly performed by this phenomenal singer. The film's title represents both Dharmendra's and Meena Kumari's characters very well. Her Shanti is Phool (flower) and his Shaka is Patthar (stone). How can a flower and a stone live together? You will have to see the film to understand it. A classic 60s picture.\n",

            "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsThere are moments in \"Santa Banta Pvt. Ltd.\" when you think that you're in for two hours of harmless fun, where the jokes, though silly, will never fail to tickle your funny bone and put a smile across your face. Like how Santa and Banta's weak grasp of the English language keeps leading to hilarious outcomes or their tendency to mix up names makes everyone from gangsters to RAW agents lose their composure. And, then, there are other moments when you're left with a puzzled look, wondering why the jokes and gags go from being silly and fun to being irrational and forced. To put it in a nutshell, Santa Banta Pvt. Ltd. is sporadically funny in parts but fails abysmally as a whole comic vehicle.To be fair, it wouldn't make sense to expect a wittily scripted, sharply executed comedy in the first place. The main characters, after all, became popular through Wassap jokes exchanged between friends and bored uncles. And, the movie does start out as an entertaining ride that uses such jokes to good effect. The problems start creeping in when the filmmakers seem to run out of jokes to hold together a 2- hour script, which is when the comedy that was flowing freely begins to stumble, and the jokes that were making us laugh naturally in the beginning barely elicit a few chuckles for the rest of the movie.Both Boman Irani (Santa) and Vir Das (Banta) do their best to make us enjoy the ride to the very end, but even their impeccable comic timing isn't enough to conceal those scenes that ask us to laugh instead of making us laugh. Vijay Raaz, Sanjay Mishra, and Ram Kapoor do their bit to lend support to Boman and Das, but they all are let down by a shoddy script and hackneyed direction. Neha Dhupia and Lisa Haydon are added purely for the purpose of eye-candy, and the numerous scenes that use them to titillate the senses contradicts the filmmaker's statements claiming this to be a kids' film.\"Santa Banta Pvt. Ltd.\" may be enjoyed remotely by the kids, but with the kind of access they have to far superior animated children's fare from Hollywood, I'd doubt that they'd even go for this tripe. Their parents, however, are bound to reject it after the jokes and gags wear thin within the first few scenes itself.\n",

His roles were full of comic adventures, a smart person who is not afraid of making a fool of himself or a full who thinks he is the smartest person. In here he plays a person who is seemingly docile but could be a murderer!!The good part of the movie is nothing is this movie is what it actually seems to be! Even if you have read the plot of this movie, there are still surprises and they come out at the very end of the movie. Very few Indian movies have been able to maintain the suspense. Om Prakash is certainly a treat to watch. Naveen Nishchol is also at his prime. Deven Verma provides comic relief in style.8/10 and is a movie which has something for everyone.\n",

            "Yugpurush is a universal picture of love and human relationships. It is a poignant, intelligent and crafted film about a man who is mentally disturbed yet widely loved and respected by normal people because of his simplicity, intelligence, positivity and love for the mankind. This man is called Anirudh, and he is played to perfection by Nana Patekar. As a child Anirudh was traumatised as a result of his parents' death, and now he has been released from the mental asylum after a long treatment. The film follows his experiences with people, the way he communicates with them and witnesses their personal troubles. The film presents three main characters through Anirudh: Ranjan (Jackie Shroff), a possessive and cruel man, Sunita (Manisha Koirala), a rich yet unhappy woman, and Deepti (Ashwini Bhave), a kind young woman. Their personalities are characterised in a rather dark way in comparison to Anirudh's bright and loving attitude. Sunita finds a real friend in Anirudh, and Deepti truly falls in love with him. This may seem quite odd given he is not a normal person, yet it is very believable throughout the film because it is a character that anyone would love. Anyone would want to have a brother, a father, an uncle, a husband, and particularly a friend like Anirudh. The film's biggest strengths are the well-written dialogues which are fascinating and Nana Patekar's exceptional performance. And these two aspects are brought together very well. The dialogues are so poetic and brilliant that several lines can be easily considered as memorable sayings, particularly those mouthed by Nana Patekar. Patekar's portrayal of Anirudh is extraordinary. His restrained body language, quiet mannerisms and superb line delivery create a lovable, ultra-sympathetic character. The rest of the cast is good, though not as memorable. Manisha Koirala is fantastic. Note the wonderful scene when she publicly auctions herself. Jackie Shroff is very effective and plays his ambiguous part exceedingly well, while Ashwini Bhave is lovely in a compelling portrayal.The title, \"Yugpurush: A Man Who Comes Just Once in a Way\" perfectly represents the film's main concept. It is the best way to describe Anirudh. At some point we too understand that he is too good for the \"sane\" world. The ending is saddening and shocking. The entire film is full of unforgettable scenes and moments. It is a film with a message, and every viewer is free to interpret it the way he wants to. All in all, this film is surely an underrated piece. It may not be very realistic, it may not be a brilliantly made film in terms of film-making, but it is a classic example of artistic excellence.\n",

            "This was the first Bollywood movie I've ever seen, and I have read that by Bollywood standards it's considered bad, but I got a tremendous kick out of this movie.I rented it due to the Nightmare on Elm Street link, but I was amazed just how blatant the rip-offs are. The first half of the movie follows the original film almost exactly, even in small details. The soundtrack is a light variation of the original, but there were many scenes where it sounded like not one note had been changed.In terms of popcorn enjoyment, this movie is delightful. There's literally something for everyone: horror, music, goofy comedy, tawdry drama. There's a little bit of gore; the only missing ingredient is nudity. The murderer is at times goofy, but he has no dialog, so the horror scenes are rarely spoiled.Most surprising of all, Mahakaal actually has a few moments where it's genuinely good. A murder involving real cobras is very creepy, and the fact that it rips of NOES' effective soundtrack helps at times to enhance the horror. There's also a very effective musical sequence in a Disco Bar that actually helps the plot, using an interesting visual technique along with catchy music.While no classic, Mahakaal is a must for cult movie enthusiasts. Hopefully, it's release on DVD will lead to a rediscovery.\n",

            "Multiple intertwining stories are becoming quite common in Hindi cinema. Examples include 'Life...in a Metro', 'Sirf', 'Mumbai Meri Jaan', 'Firaaq' and now 'Tera Kya Hoga Johnny'. In Sudhir Mishra's film, the common link between the stories is the title character. Johnny is a teenager who dreams of going to Dubai one day and he hopes that one day he will get enough money (either from Priya, Parvez or a pimp). However, all the characters have their own struggles, their own dreams and ambitions that are linked with others and it's only a matter of time that Johnny finds himself involved in their mess.Sudhir Mishra has made some amazing movies like 'Hazaar Khwahishein Aisi' but 'Tera Kya Hoga Johnny' isn't one of them. The pace is slow in the beginning. The Sudhir Mishra - Soha Ali Khan track looks contrived and ill fitting with the rest of the storyline. Moreover, some of the other subplots required development. The Abhay Deol item number is quite pointless. Some sequences which are suggestive and while the ambiguity may be intentional, it adds nothing to the film. Soha Ali Khan and Karan Nath give theatrical performances while Neil Nitin Mukesh still has a long way to go (he's pretty much in his 'Johnny Gaddaar' mode).On the plus side, the background score and cinematography are excellent. Kay Kay Menon, Shahana Goswami and Saurabh Shukla give first rate performances. Debutant Sikandar Agarwal is impressive too. Some of the dialogues work well while others are ordinary.'Tera Kya Hoga Johnny' may not be Mishra's best but it's still worth the watch. The concept is somewhat refreshing and you want to know what fate holds for these characters (even though they're not particularly likable).\n",

Shroff decides to put an end to the corrupt practices of the Thakur right from the start. The animosity between the two thus starts. In the mean time Shroff falls for the village girl, Poonam Dhillon. Thakur has lustful designs upon Poonam. One night Amreesh Puri tries to rape Poonam who commits suicide to avoid being dishonoured. When Shroff comes back to Village and gets the news he vents his anger and anguish upon his pet dog for not saving his beloved. Later he comes to know that the quadruped could not have done anything for it had been shut up in a room at that time. Here starts the highlight of the movie -- the song filled with grief and gratitude, Teri Meharbaniyan teri qadardaaniyan...Thakur's villainy continues unabated. He habitually tortures his dumb servant and tries to rape the girl who tries to commiserate with him. Both of them flee the clutches of Amrish Puri and take refuge with Jacky Shroff. Thakur as a revenge tries to kill all of them but succeeds to murder Shroff only. The loyal dog takes it upon himself to take revenge by killing all the accomplices in the murder of his master, one by one.Comments:If it were not for the tragically enchanting music by Lakhmikant Pyarelaal, this film could not have left even a trace of remembrance. Worse than a pot-boiler plot and treatment, an extremely disinterested Jacky Shroff, a mundane Poonam Dhillon, a usual villainous Amreesh Puri, the saving grace in the movie were Asraani and the dog. Asraani does elicit some genuine smiles with his antics, whereas the quadruped surprises us with the kind of thorough training he has had. Still, omit the deeply and intensely tragical song \"Teri meharbaaniyaan....\" you have nothing left in the movie. I saw the movie only for this song and was not disappointed, at least to the extent of this unforgettable epitome of heart-rending tragedy.\n",

            "I like this movie. Pooja Bhatt was my favorite, of course most people would say that it would be Madhuri for obvious reasons. I liked Pooja's honesty, because right now its a gimmick to try to be modern. Pooja was Pooja. I respect Madhuri because she was the ideal woman, she is the women all women aspire to be: the dutiful daughter-loyal wife-and the ideal mother. They are both very similar than different and this reflects in their upbringing: Pooja had lots of freedom of expression, and Madhuri expressed her creativity through art and dance. The film industry did not appreciate Pooja and they criticized her...The film industry criticized Madhuri after a certain age but most of her best work came later (Dil to Pagal Hai, Devadas, Pukaar). The industry is male dominated but I will not tolerate man haters...blaming men is wrong. I can think of a long list of men besides my father in my life who have given me nothing but patience, love and respect---no matter how moody I have been. There are many sides to a woman, a true man no matter what his age is knows that. Case in point I have come across many guys that can read me like a book and I have not said anything to them, of course there are those who assume things but the wise ones wait...the others quietly regret. I have nothing much to say about the movie except I remember the ABC...song it was cute. I liked Madhuris photographs. Kinda weird how he kept life size photos of her...did he need a visual reminder of her perfection. That kind of relation is an illusion, a photo is a worth a thousand words. I think of my Enlish 11 Profs words...he also said he was a Tree in his past life, he told us to eat one egg in the morning for protein, and he was married to the French teacher hehehe. Getting back to Prem Deewane: Prem means something along the lines of love, and Deewane means love or crazy lover. People are not crazy when they are in love that is a total myth. We have many illusions about love that we create, depending on the social climate of the times. That why it is best to pursue a well-rounded education (no need for phD analysis). I think I believe in monogamy due to watching Hindi movies of the 90s, but I realize that time changes everything whether we chose to accept this or not is our choice. This movie was fun, it reflected the 90s well. I never judged Pooja because I knew that she was being honest because she felt secure, and emotional security can only be passed from father-daughter. Mahesh Bhatt's legacy is his daughter, she is still very young in terms of Hollywood standards. I remember a quote of hers...she said something about being able to live anywhere and survive because she has acquired the tools. I have met many many men like Mahesh Bhatt and it all started in 89 when as a family we watched Daddy on video (not VHS but Beta I believe). I have to thank my Dad for putting up with me, but he already knows I can see it in his eyes. Expression not repression!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Destiny is like the family we are born into and Free will is what we become. History is a great teacher, it is a waste of time to make the same mistake over and over...due to fear. Fear of self has to be the greatest fear and that is what causes problems. Experience is necessary for growth because there should be no regrets. If one has regrets then they are missing out. Pooja and Madhuri have none, both of them look fabulous.I know I went off topic with this comment...I hope someone outthere finds it interesting. I apologize for the grammatical errors\n",

            "GANDHI TO Hitler – the title was very intriguing, the posters were even more impressive and the subject was the first of its kind never ever tried before in Hindi Cinema. But that was what I had in mind before watching it.And now after having seen this bio-pic, I can only say that it's a highly amateurish attempt by its director in absence of any particular aim or vision to showcase the conflict between the contrasting ideologies of these two Historical stalwarts. In few words, there is nothing exciting, provoking or impactful in the whole film revolving around its world famous characters and in fact it's a big disappointment for the viewers who were expecting something great in it as suggested by its well thought of Title.Now where the movie actually fails? First of all the film never clearly talks about the individual ideologies of either Gandhi or Hitler. In real terms, the Title of the film itself is wrong as there are very few scenes of Gandhi writing his two letters to Hitler and Hitler reacting on them in his own style. So if you wish to see anything related to that then there is nothing in it for you.Actually the film's title should have been \"The Last Days of Hitler\" since the script mainly focuses on this subject more than the publicized one. Frankly speaking, in my opinion it was only the last day Marriage & Suicide episode in Hitler's Life which might have excited the makers and they just thought of making a film over it. Now as only Hitler would not have worked in India, so they brought in Gandhi too in the script to give it an Indian feel and started making it with all this confused vision. And the result is right there in front us, which doesn't really move the viewer even once.Secondly, the film doesn't have a fixed focus on its subject. Like, I couldn't understand What was the purpose of showing a parallel track of Indian soldiers fighting on foreign land, with such a long screen time interrupting other proceedings. Along with that What were the songs (including a Holi Track) doing in such intense movie based on a dark subject?Thirdly, this is not the movie which will make any sense to the viewers who don't know anything in details about Hitler and have just heard some facts about his rule vaguely. The film never portrays the real cruel and powerful persona of the person and neither it talks about the HOLOCAUST anywhere in its script. So it overall starts with an assumption that the viewer already knows everything about Hitler which is a big drawback.Lastly, the film fails completely in its Casting department (with only a few exceptions). Taking Indian actors for the role of Hitler and his team of Officers and Soldiers was indeed a very funny decision. The biggest mistake remains taking Raghuvir Yadav for the role of Hitler himself which falls flat. Its not the case that Raghuvir hasn't done well, but it's the case of his Established Comic Identity in the mind of Indian viewers which restricts them to accept him as Hitler. In simple words, at time he more looks like Chaplin in his short height (as was Hitler) and Charlie moustaches, which works a big hindrance in making a solid impact on the audience. As I feel, the role should have been given to some unknown actor who doesn't have any fixed image of his own. Even Anupam Kher would have failed in this particular role, had he accepted the film as per the early reports.Avijit Dutt as Mahatma Gandhi is pretty ordinary and Aman Verma as the Indian Soldier is another miscast in the film who really doesn't seem like fighting for his country. Actually I seriously feel that it becomes difficult to accept an actor in a particular role who is active both on the Small Screen (T.V.) as well as the Big Screen at the same time. At times the small screen image interferes heavily in the film, which lessens the overall impact of a performance. In the female lead, Neha Dhupia as Eva Braun, remains one of the few watchable and glamorous elements in the film, with a bit overdone make up. Though she doesn't get a good backing from the writers but in spite of that Neha very well manages to make an impact with her talking eyes, particularly towards the climax.So, Is there nothing to see in GANDHI TO Hitler? Yes in a broader sense there is nothing. But it does have a well worked upon Cinematography with a fine colour correction as its merit. Plus if you don't know anything about Hitler's end and his last day marriage with the mysterious lady Eva Braun, then you can give it a chance only to have some visual information about the man. Otherwise don't expect it to be even anywhere close to the western films made on the aura around The Great Dictator.\n",

            "The whole of India would recognize Saat Hindustaani (1969) as the debut film of Amitabh Bachchan. But beyond that hardly anyone would know anything about the movie in terms of its cast, story, setting, etc because most of them (including hardcore Amitabh Bachchan fans) might have never seen this film. Though each and every film of Amitabh Bachchan repeatedly keeps playing on TV channels, I have never come across this film on the small screen ever. So had to rent a VCD which was marred by bad print and sound quality. However it conveyed the spirit of the film.This is the one and only film of Amitabh Bachchan in Black and White. From more than 30+ films that Khwaja Ahmed Abbas directed in his career, this is the only one that got him popularity and remains tagged with his name till date. Its common knowledge how classic Westerners like 'The Magnificent Seven' or the Japanese film 'Seven Samurai' were inspirations behind Amitabh Bachchan starrer Sholay. However even 'Saat Hindustani' (Seven Indians) had traces of those films in terms of seven diverse individuals coming together to free people from foreign rule. Allegedly Saat Hindustani is loosely derived from Hollywood flick 'For Whom The Bell Tolls'(1943).Beyond Amitabh Bachchan, the film had a lot to offer. There was an array of assorted actors and each of them, barring Utpal Dutt, were almost first timers. Utpal Dutt was the only established actor in the star cast. Saat Hindustani was a social war drama with lot of action and adventure stuffed in. It had a strong social message to convey – about national integration in a country separated by religion, caste, language and social status.The story is about a Goan girl Maria (Shenaaz) who, on her death bed, sends postal invitations to all her revolutionary colleagues who once came together to free Goa from the Portugal rule. All of Maria's six teammates are introduced in present times. Ex-army-man Joginder Nath (Utpal Dutt) is unhappy with the partition of Punjab state. The fields that he ploughed in Punjab in morning ended up being in Haryana in the evening following the divide. Tamalian Mahadevan (Irshad Ali) who once endorsed the national language Hindi in Madras, now hates the language with changing times. He is also a harijan – meaning a person from the lower caste. Anwar Ali (Amitabh Bachchan) is an Urdu poet who believes that Hindi is too complicated. His house is burnt down as a result of the Hindi-Urdu feud. Ram Bhagat Sharma (Anwar Ali) propagates through his newspaper that anyone who doesn't support Hindi in the North Eastern (Hindi-dominated) belt will face dire consequences. Sakharam Shinde (Jalal Agha), a wandering theatre artist, hails from Maharashta where several boundary districts like Belgaum and Bidar are fighting to be integrated with the Maharashta state. (Since then till present day, Belgaum city on the Maharashtra-Karnataka boundary is still making headlines over which state it should integrate with – which makes one wonder how the issues in India have continued for decades and are still pertinent). Lastly Shabut Sanyal (Madhu) comes from Bengal.And to think of it, all these six individuals who presently have caste, creed or racial differences, once came together to fight the Portuguese and free Goa from their rule. Goa, then, had similar conflicts like Kashmir has today. Locals from Goa had a feeling that though it was a part of India, the Indian government didn't consider them equal and fight for their rights or freedom. That's when these Seven Indians (Saat Hindustani), including Maria come together, undergo physical training and get set on a mission to host seven flags at seven prominent police stations or monuments in Goa.The beauty of director K.A.Abbas' casting was that he made each actor play a character against his real-life region or religion. So the Bengali Utpal Dutt played a Punjabi in the film, while Malayalee actor Madhu played a Bengali character. Muslim actors Irshad Ali and Jalal Agha played South Indian and Maharashtrian characters convincingly and so did Muslim actress Shenaaz, compellingly pulling off a Christian character. Son of Hindu poet Amitabh Bachchan played a Muslim shayar, while Muslim actor Anwar Ali played a staunch Hindu (Bachchan also took his character name from Anwar Ali). Through such a casting, the director gave a subtle message on tolerance for other communities with national integration being the bigger picture.The performances, not just by Amitabh Bachchan, but even other actors like Utpal Dutt and Jalal Agha were brilliant. Shenaaz reminds of Zeenat Aman in several frames. Madhu was low on screen presence and took a backseat. Amitabh Bachchan who went on to become the biggest superstar of Hindi cinema, which he is even today, won a National Award in this debut film of his. Saat Hindustani also won the Best Film (K.A.Abbas) and Best Lyrics (Kaifi Azmi) Award for National Integration.The pace gets slow at times but otherwise, Saat Hindustani is an entertaining action-adventure-social-war drama. Watch it even today and you won't be disappointed. Because not much has changed in the country since then!Gaurav Malani\n",

            "Khwahish is not an original movie. It is based upon Erich Segal's famous novel \"Love Story\", which was made into a successful film in 1970. The story may not be new, but the writing was probably solid enough to make this romantic drama engaging. The film looked authentic, and the depiction was very simple. It was quite atypical in that it involved kissing scenes and several discussions about sex and social values. Even when the film entered its emotional phase, it was not overly melodramatic. The characters of Amar and particularly Lekha were quite interesting. He is a serious, headstrong and struggling guy, she is a simple, forthright, no-nonsense and smart girl, who is a fan of RD Burman's music. Their relationship was according to me portrayed quite well. The relationship between Lekha and her father Ulhas was also well done. Khawahish is Mallika Sherwat's film. She is the best thing about this film and the main reason it actually works. This is by no means a great performance, but she was simply lovable and played her role as naturally as she could, with evident sincerity and energy. Not to forget that she was absolutely sizzling and super sexy. Himanshu Malik was just okay in his role, while Mahmud Babai was fine as Lekha's loving father Ulhas. The soundtrack is one more reason to watch this film, and it gives the film a certain charm not warranted by the script. Asha Bhosle sings most of the songs and she does it brilliantly. My most favourite song is \"Jaanemann\", which was wonderful. Khwahish is not a great film, it lacks depth and at some points it is a bit slow, with the second half going downhill and losing its effervescence. That said, after all it does manage to move you with its final emotional proceedings and its tragic ending and is an overall enjoyable film despite the usual problems.\n",

            "Ranbir Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan are today's superstars. However their fathers (Rishi Kapoor and Rakesh Roshan) have not only been good friends in real life but also given some entertaining movies by their joint performances in reel life more than three decades back. Though Rishi Kapoor was a superstar of the seventies and the eighties whereas Rakesh Roshan was considered a B grade hero only, their on-screen chemistry was amazing. Perhaps their real life friendship helped them in creating magic on the screen. Today I am reviewing a movie which is a mindless romantic comedy starring these two heroes which can be enjoyed by keeping your mind under lock and key only. It's Aapke Deewaane (1980) whose presenter is none other than Rakesh Roshan himself.Aapke Deewaane (crazy for you) is the story of two friends - Ram (Rishi Kapoor) and Raheem (Rakesh Roshan) who are apparently orphans and live together while studying in a college. They are the filmi ideals of communal harmony because Ram scores 92% marks in Urdu whereas Raheem scores similarly in Hindi. They bring about the first twist in their friendship tale by adopting O Henry's classic story - The Gift of the Magi by selling own favourite items to buy gifts for each other. Well, we are moved by their filmi friendship.Now the next twist in the tale comes through the villain who is the college bully - Kundan (Ranjeet) who frames them in a false molestation charge and gets them rusticated from the college. However they injure him in the ensuing fist-fight and run away from the city. Now their (filmi) destiny carries them to a Kashmir where they face the problem of making a living. Their problem gets resolved through the job of tutoring a young girl - Sameera (Tina Munim) who is the foster-daughter of two aged bachelors - Thakur Vikramjit Singh (Pran) and Inshallah Khan (Ashok Kumar). Since both these guardians are against keeping young men as her tutors, our heroes have to masquerade themselves. Ram opts for the disguise of an old man whereas Raheem disguises himself as a middle-aged woman. Ram in his real self pretends to be the son of the lady-teacher (i.e., Raheem in disguise) and Raheem on the other hand pretends to be the son of the old male tutor (i.e., Ram in disguise). Sameera finds both Ram and Raheem as worthy of becoming her husband but her dilemma is whom to choose out of these two. Her guardians, quite naturally, choose both these heroes as her beaus according to their own personal choices.The mindless comedy alongwith this love triangle moves on till the villain is back to inflict his revenge upon the heroes. His attack on the heroine resolves the love triangle too. Finally in the wedding party, Ram and Raheem shake hands and the screen reads - FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDS (instead of THE END). I believe in this dictum. Hope, my readers also do.This nonsense movie works mainly because of the amazing on-screen chemistry between the two heroes. Rishi and Rakesh compliment each other perfectly and the screen is lit up by their admirable performances. Their another real-life friend Jeetendra is also there in a guest role with an item number being picturized on him (with the two heroes joining him in the dance). Tina Munim seems to know only smiling in the name of acting. Ashok Kumar and Pran try to repeat their Victoria No. 203 act with partial success only. Ranjeet as villain is routine. Young and beautiful Shoma Anand too is there in a cameo.Music composed by Rakesh Roshan's brother (and Hrithik Roshan's uncle) - Rajesh Roshan is according to the mood of the movie. The title track alongwith the Rafi-Kishore duet - Tumko Khush Dekhar Main Bahut Khush Hua stands out. One more song - Ram Kare Allah Kare (containing western effect through -APININANA BENTO) which has sung by Rafi and Amit Kumar (Kishore Kumar's son) is also impressive and entertaining.Cinematography spreading the beauty of Kashmir on the screen is extremely eye-soothing. Technically the movie is up to the mark. However editing should have been better. The movie irritates at places but if you watch it without trying to locate logic in it, you will enjoy it thoroughly.I recommend this movie to the fans of Rishi Kapoor and Rakesh Roshan who will find this mindless comedy certainly better than the contemporary David Dhawan and Anees Bazmee comedies. Finally, I end my review with a SHER of Janaab Khwaaja Meer Dard Saheb :Mera Jee Hai Jab Tak, Teri Justujoo Hai Jubaan Jab Talak Hai, Yahi Guftagoo Hai Kiya Sair Humne Gulzaar-e-Duniya Gul-e-Dosti Mein Ajab Rang-o-Boo Hai\n",

The grandparents become close to the grandson The grandson comes to prefer his grandparents over his parents and so are thrown out into the cold cruel world to fend for themselves and the child is told his grandparents are dead.20 years later the child is all grown up and finds out his grandparents are still alive and decides to teach his parents a lesson.\n",

Vanshikha falls in love with Abhay, but he finds her unattractive. She changes her appearance, capturing his attention, but he doesn't want a serious relationship. They then embark on an adventure that causes them to reevaluate their feelings for each other.Silsila Hai Pyar Ka is a movie with very little substance. The plot is mostly predictable, with the exception of the unbelievable adventure, and focuses on the importance of beauty over personality. Singh is only average at acting, dancing, and action, leaving the viewer to wish for a more dynamic hero. The supporting cast are dependable veterans, but don't have extensive parts.

I was engrossed with Ab Ke Baras from the beginning. So what if the movie wasn't all that promoted, or that the main actors are fairly new to the screen, or even that some scenes could have been left out. I don't think these things even came close to outweighing the good qualities this movie contained. What really got me was the passion in which the actors brought out the characters. It's such an innocent movie. If I was to watch the first five minutes and the last five minutes, I wouldn't have known the two scenes were connected. I liked the fact that I never knew where the movie would go (in a good way, not that it was hard to follow). Isn't that an element of a good, thought out, creative movie? I believe so. One thing that might discourage people from watching this movie is that it's nearly, or actually I think it's a little over, 3 hours long. But again, unless you have somewhere to go or something else to be doing, it's well worth your time if you are a person looking for a real feel good movie. I will say this though, if you're a person who loves to watch the latest modernized \"love triangle\" type movies, you might not appreciate Ab Ke Baras the way I did.

            "Amanush (1975) is a very popular, commercially successful and critically acclaimed movie made in both Hindi and Bengali. Directed by Shakti Saamanta, this movie is based on Shaktipada Raajguru's story - 'Naya Basat'. The pillar of Indian cinema in general and Bengali cinema in particular - Uttam Kumar played the lead role in it with the ever gorgeous Sharmila Tagore, another gift to Indian cinema from Bengal, being cast opposite him.We all criticize, discard, scorn and sometimes hate the drunkards. But why does an otherwise normal person turn into a drunkard ? Seldom we ponder over this question. Drinking is bad but as they say, 'I drink to forget my sorrow' (Gham Bhulaane Ke Liye Peeta Hoon), sometimes a drunkard requires genuine sympathy and understanding (if not love) to return to his normal self. Change the circumstances, changes the person. Amanush (non-human being or beast) underscores this fact.The Amanush of this movie who generates both fear and hatred at the same time in the onlookers, is an alcoholic Madhusudan Chaudhary (Uttam Kumar) whose alcoholism and weird activities are visible to all but not the mountain of grief hidden in his heard. He was in love with Lekha (Sharmila Tagore) but an intricate conspiracy masterminded by Mahim Ghoshal (Utpal Dutt) against him destroyed everything for him, making his life no better than hell for him. The severest pinch for him is the lack of understanding on the part of his sweetheart Lekha. If only she understood him correctly ! But . . .! Alas ! But as they say, times change. Day follows night and primavera follows autumn. Living in complete dark, Madhusudan's life gets a ray of sunshine when a sensitive cop Bhuvan Roy (Anil Chatterjee) comes across him. He tries to trace the origins of the alcoholism and the weird behaviour of Madhusudan and then finally reaches the truth which had turned a Maanush (human-being) into an Amaanush (beast). Things change for Madhusudan, Lekha comes to understand him correctly and the baddie is finally served right.All of a sudden, I have got a flash of lightning in my heard that the super hit movie of Sunil Shetty and Ajay Devgan - Dilwaale (1994) was also based on the same theme only with Ajay Devgan in the role akin to that Uttam Kumar in Amanush. However contrary to formula-studded Dilwale, Amanush is a far better movie and much more sensitive movie especially the Bengali version.Director Shakti Saamanta has handled the admirable story well but still his direction leaves something to be desired in the Hindi version. The grief and stuffiness in the heart of the protagonist is revealed to the audience more through the stellar performance of the actor (Uttam Kumar) and less through the script and the direction.The movie is quite entertaining and gripping and that's one good reason for its huge commercial success. The story flows well mostly in the flashback and thoroughly entertains the audience. There's no boredom at any place though there are no relief moments also in the serious storyline.On one hand, I like Bhuvan Roy's sympathetic and understanding attitude the aggrieved and misunderstood hero, on the other I dislike Lekha's easily misunderstanding him and turning her back to him. If you love someone, you have to learn to trust him / her also. Even when the whole world seems to be against him / her, he / she should feel that at least you are on his / her side, you are understanding him / her, your shoulder is there for resting the head and shed tears. Else your love is nothing but hollow, a fair weather friend. It's difficult to correctly understand someone, misunderstanding is always easy but unfortunately, most of us prefer to choose this easy path.The movie is soaked in Bengali culture and environment and all the technical aspects appear to be in more or less in order. Mostly shot in the Sunderbans, the movie renders a different flavour, pleasantly different I must say. The milieu is in sync with the story and the characters.The biggest asset of this movie is Uttam Kumar whose towering performance makes it watchable for all. Sharmila Tagore fits the bill of the heroine very well. Another brilliant performance in the movie is of Utpal Dutt in the role of the villain. Anil Chatterjee has also done satisfactorily as the sympathetic cop. The supporting cast is well in place.Shyamal Mitra's music is very good. Kishore Kumar's popular sad song - Dil Aisa Kisi Ne Mera Toda (which is the title track) is the highlight of this movie. Kal Ke Apne Na Jaane Kyun and Gham Ki Dawa To Pyar Hai (both by Asha Bhosle) and Na Poochho Koi Hamen Zahar Kyun Pee Liya (by Kishore) are also quite good. The meaningful lyrics of these songs have been penned by Indeevar.So many convicts in Indian jails are not actually criminals. Some may be victim of adverse circumstances and some may be totally innocent and wronged by others. Can't we have sensitive cops like Bhuvan Roy who can give importance to read the language of their tears and then try to wipe them ?\n",

Leaving his beloved, Wahida Rehman, behind, he goes abroad to unveil the conspiracy and befriends Zahida, the enemy's moll. Wahida follows him but is dejected seeing him with Zahida. In time Dev also comes back and is engulfed in full scale war to defeat the enemy.Dev's first official attempt at direction, though it is said that he had a lot to do with the direction of \"Teen Devian\" and \"Gambler\". He did a reassuring job. The lead players were all good. Technically the film was polished. Yet again, Sachin Deb Burman gave excellent music. His own rendering \" Prem ke pujari, ham hain\" was superb. Kishore Kumar's \"Phoolon ke rang se, dil ki qalam se\" was another excellent number, and so was Lata's \"Rangeela re, tere rang se, yun ranga hai, mera man\". Another typical Burman duet was \"Shokhiyon mein ghola jaaye, phoolon ka shabab\", sung by Kishore and Lata. Punjabi folk music came out beautifully in \"Doongi tennu reshmi rumaal\", sung by Lata and chorus. Other good numbers include Manna Dey and Mohd. Rafi's \"Taqat watan ki hamse hai\", the marching song, sung with chorus, and the happy-go-lucky number \"Gham pe dhool daalo, kehkaha lagalo\", sung by Kishore and Bhupendra. Lyrics by the renowned poet, Neeraj, were excellent.Overall, a reasonably good film by Dev Anand.\n",

            "Set in the Roman era at the time of Jewish persecution in Rome, Bimal Roy's Yahudi (meaning Jewish) is a well written and original love story. The film tells the story of Hannah, a young Jewish woman, and Marcus, a Roman prince. Hannah's real name is actually Lydia, and she is the daughter of cruel Roman emperor Brutus. As a child Lydia was kidnapped by Emanuelle, the faithful servant of a jeweler named Ezra, after the latter's little son was sentenced to death by Brutus post an insignificant incident. When the little girl is brought to Ezra, he pities the little girl and refuses to take revenge by killing her. Instead, he decides to make her take his dead son's place and bring her up as his own daughter. That's how her name is changed to Hannah. Soon a young and beautiful Hannah falls for a Roman prince named Marcus, who is to marry princess Octavia, Brutus's niece. Marcus falls for her too, and in order to spend time with her pretends to be a Jewish. Their relationship comes to an end when Hannah finds out he is not Jewish. The following sequences are of the film's most intense and unpredictable.Bimal Roy, one of the finest filmmakers to have ever worked in the Indian film industry, directs Yahudi with great precision. He captures the atmosphere of those times and his portrayal of both the Jewish people and the Roman empire is well done. The costumes, the sets are great, and the music is very good and melodious. Yahudi is a love story more than anything else; the dialogues are very poetic and the songs are very romantic. Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari star as Marcus and Hannah and both do a very good job. Kumar is once again restrained and effective, while Kumari looks impossibly beautiful in this one, and she was always the perfect choice for dramatic features of this sort. Sohrab Modi is excellent as Ezra, and Nigar Sultana is wonderful as the arrogant Octavia. Yahudi is not among the very best films of Bimal Roy, but it is still enjoyable and memorable. What I particularly liked about the film is its ending, which is not sugarcoated as many other endings. It was heartwarming and the very final dialogues were outstanding. Yahudi is a lesser known Bimal Roy picture which is definitely worth watching.\n",

            "Aan Milo Sajna (come and meet me O sweetheart) is the story of a college student Varsha (Asha Parekh) who during her vacation, decides to have an adventure and becomes the fake fiancée of a rich brat Anil Chaudhary (Vinod Khanna) posing as a poor girl Deepali who is doing it for money. Due to Anil's objectionable life-style, his widow mother Saavitri Devi Chaudhary (Nirupa Roy) dislikes him and has put a condition in her will that Anil will inherit her wealth only upon getting married to a suitable girl. And to win his old and ailing mother's trust in this regard, Anil brings Varsha aka Deepali to her in the village, showing her as his fiancée without knowing that the girl herself is not what she is posing to be. Varsha posing as Deepali now comes to know of Anil's greedy and wicked nature and his mother's disappointment with him but through her own good nature, she wins the heart of Saavitri Devi who is now glad that her spoiled son has chosen a nice girl as his life-partner. But Varsha's life becomes a complicated one when she falls in love with Ajeet (Rajesh Khanna) in the village. Ajeet is a boy with a heart of gold who always helps the people in the lower strata of the society and is ever ready to support their cause. He is also fatherless and lives with his widow mother (Dulaari) and younger brother Jaggu (Junior Mehmood). Romance blooms between them and now Varsha starts suffering from guilt-complex that on one hand she has hidden her true identity from all and on the other she is deceiving the innocent Saavitri Devi by making her believe that she would be her daughter-in-law while being in love with not his son but someone else.Besides, there is a back-story of the households of Ajeet and Anil also due to which Ajeet hates the Chaudhary family.Things take a bizarre turn when Ajeet's friend - Mohan (Sujeet Kumar) who has become a fugitive due to a false theft-charge levied on him, keeps on visiting his newly wed wife - Sita (Indrani Mukherjee) with complete secrecy with the help of his trusted friend, i.e., Ajeet who has faith in his innocence and is confident of getting him exonerated soon. Resultantly, Sita becomes pregnant but not able to tell the other members of the family as well as the world that her pregnancy is due to her clandestine meetings with her husband only. Villainous Anil comes to know of the different facts and on their basis, makes his own evil designs. And then one day, Sita is murdered with Ajeet being arrested under the charge of her murder. He is accused to be the father of the unborn child of pregnant Sita who killed her after coming to know of her pregnancy. The formula-based climax takes the story to its desired conclusion.Aan Milo Sajna contains all the spices that make a delicious visual dish for the typical Indian audience. It has good romance between the stylish Rajesh Khanna and the gorgeous Asha Parekh. It has good comedy through comedians like Junior Mehmood, Rajendra Naath, Sunder etc. alongwith the lead pair itself. It has a typical Bollywood villain and his interesting conspiracies. It has family and social drama showing enmity between two households plus the everlasting conflict between the rich and the poor. It has action (the opening scene itself contains a horse-race) and courtroom drama. And it contains some very good songs The optimum mix of all these things proves to be a satisfying entertainment show for the audience that lasts for around three hours.Producer-director J. Om Prakash had a habit of keeping the titles of his movies as starting from the letter 'A'. This movie is another link in the chain of his 'A' titled entertaining movies. Since J. Om Prakash was able to pick up the pulse of the Indian audience very well, most of the movies made by him are damn entertaining and they were box office hits. Aan Milo Sajna is no exception. The movie does not bore at all and proves to be thoroughly engrossing for the viewer.Technically, the movie is damn good. Beautiful rural locales are eye-candy for the spectator. Since both the rich household and the poor household are part of the script, the art-director had to differentiate between the two and he has done it quite effectively with both types of setting appearing as realistic on the screen. The wardrobe of the lead pair is damn impressive and trendy.Music made by Laxmikant Pyarelaal with the lyrics of Anand Bakshi is very good with almost all the songs being popular ones. The title track has been sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi. However most of the male songs are in the voice of Kishore Kumar. Achchha To Hum Chalte Hain and Yahaan Wahaan Saare Jahaan Mein Tera Raaj Hai are Kishore's popular songs whereas Lata's solo Tere Kaaran Tere Kaaran and Asha Bhonsle's solo Palat Meri Jaan are also quite good to listen (and to watch). However my favourite song from this music album is Rafi's Koi Nazrana Lekar Aaya Hoon Main Deewana Tere Liye.Rajesh Khanna's gimmicks and style had taken him on the top of the world then. He is present with all his mannerisms which are heart-conquering even today (in those days, they were just like a lightning for the young female hearts). His on-screen chemistry with Asha Parekh is praiseworthy and they look a lovely pair. Vinod Khanna is quite effective as the villain. Summing up, Aan Milo Sajna is an entertaining flick which won't disappoint any section of the audience. I wholeheartedly recommend it to the movie buffs of all categories.\n",

            "\"Chhalia\" is Manmohan Desai's first film, with telltale signs of the emerging showman's narration skills. The story is set around the Partition era when Kewal (Rehman) leaves behind his newly wedded wife Shanti (Nutan) in Lahore, for reasons not divulged to the viewer. Shanti makes it to India a few years later with her little son, in the hope of being reunited with her husband.Kewal is overjoyed to meet his wife and son, but everything goes wrong when the boy introduces himself as \"Anwar\". As for his father's name, he replies \"Abdul Rehman\". Kewal abandons his wife and son. After leaving the boy in an orphanage, Shanti tries to kill herself but is rescued by Chhalia (Raj Kapoor), who shelters her. Chhalia falls in love with Shanti only to learn of her previous marriage and her son.The story now meanders tortuously towards the inevitable reunion of Kewal and his family. A subplot involves a meaningless showdown between Abdul Rehman (Pran), and Chhalia. The climax is set at the scene of Dussehra festivities, where the effigy of Ravana is to be burnt. Chhalia draws parallels between Shanti and Sita in a seemingly unending Rafi song to convince Kewal of her fidelity.Nutan and Raj Kapoor are largely wasted in this movie. The plot lacks substance and lacks credibility at times, while the narration meanders meaninglessly. The climax is almost insufferable. Music by Kalyanji Anandji is a definite plus though. \"Chhalia mera naam\", the timeless \"Dum dum diga diga\" and \"Mere toote hue dil se\" are among Mukesh's most popular renditions.\n",

            "The Whole movie relies on Dharmendra's performance. The direction is also OK. However the central characters played by dharmendra is not the usual dharmendra playing action hero in other films. This is what to like about this film . that you will see dharmendra playing an well-educated man who reaches success in short time . But it only lasts for short time and his rainy days start over. His character is quite dynamic and compelling. he plays comic, tragical, sad, happy man in different phases of life in the movie. IF you think dharmendra can't act well. You should watch this movie. Then I believe you would have to change your opinion on him . He is not less than other talented actor in those days. However this movie's been low profile of his. I would recommend to this movie to every dharmendra fan and who likes Indian cinema of 70s. I ensure you will have nice time going through this movie. Rakhee playing the supporting role is also quite good but can't be compared to dharmendra. Performances are fine, songs are alrite, dharmendra's performance is to watch out. SO if you thinking of spending some free time at home? rent this DVD and watch it. You will have some nice time. so enjoy a good piece of work by satyen bose in 70s . have a nice time. And also this movie has 2 issues to talk about like is money more important or honour?\n",

If you want to leave behind your brains at home and watch stupid 'Govinda' kind of movie, then please stay away.If you liked Arth (1982)(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083578/ ) remember the song \"Tum Itna Jo Muskura Rahe Ho\", then you will like this movie. You need a mood to taste a mature and adult theme.If you have a bit of patience, are not judgmental without reason and would want to give the film to develop itself to be a 'drama' that appeals to your intellect, then please watch this.It has a very creative plot and grows in a very realistic and practical way. The subject of relationship between a man and a women have been treated in a mature way. There is nice use of colour, locations and beautiful nudity (without being disturbing the audience).Music is soothing and blends well with the theme and situation. Most of it is ghazal. I wont mind buying the CD.Actors have done a good work. I say this again there is patience involved in watching this movie, if you give it a chance, you will truly be rewarded with a refreshingly nice film to come out of Hindi Film Industry.If you are from India, I would request you to understand that the movie is not made in India, and characters, actors, locations will have a mix of the western culture that this movie comes from. Look at it with a objective outlook before criticising it.Interesting films like this one and Arth are really missed in today's age of 'Golmaal movies' Audience are repeatedly treated to trash and brainless humor.

During one of his crime capers, he comes across another person in the process of commtting a crime, who assists him. The two eventually take a liking to each other, however, Durjan and his henchmen have other plans.Another Bollywood potboiler of the 1970s that has two brothers separate as kids, though the difference they're not blood brothers. It treads familiar ground, has the usual coincidences you find in these type of film, but it is expected. It's diverting enough, has enough action and plot twists to keep you in your seat.Shatrughan Sinha and Danny work well together, but it's Ajit - the Vincent Price of Bollywood- who steals the scene as the criminal who stoops low enough to get his revenge on the man who put him behind bars.\n",

            "Aashirwad is quite different from the usual Hrishikesh Mukherjee films we are used to watching, being somewhat more emotional. Some sequences like the ending were melodramatic yet the film is very effective. Like most of Mukherjee's movies, this one is authentic, simple and not overly lengthy. I enjoyed it, but I somehow expected something else despite the fact that this is definitely a worthy picture. I did not understand why Ashok Kumar's character had to give himself up in court when everyone was trying to save him from jail. He killed a man out of self defense while also protecting a young woman who was molested, and preferred to get punished and imprisoned. Such moral sacrifices are very hard to believe. Nonetheless, Ashok Kumar was outstanding as the loving father who gets jailed and as a result fears to meet again his daughter whom he has been waiting to see as he realises her contempt for criminals. He was thoroughly likable, and his graciousness, humane values and love for children were aptly displayed, as was his yearning to see his daughter and bless her upon marriage. There were some very nice poetry sequences in it written by his character for his daughter while in prison, and the music is also good. I quite liked Kumar's rap song. Sanjeev Kumar was also very natural as the doctor of the jail and Ashok Kumar's future son in-law. The ending is, as already mentioned, melodramatic but it does move you. My favourite scene is the one in which Kumar meets his daughter when she visits her fiancée and runs away as he knows of her loath for convicts, while she stops him and asks him to stay and have a chat with her. All in all, an altogether moving piece by the great Mukherjee.\n",

I rented it on a lark and thoroughly enjoyed it -- the overblown production numbers, the lively music, the humor, the colorful direction, the slice of Indian culture (however thin), even the subtitles. And except for one minor bit of what might be considered toilet humor, it's squeaky clean. Maybe that's part of the problem with some of those who didn't like the movie and have come to expect at least some sexuality or provocative scenes in every film.Unfortunately, even Bollywood is beginning to move into some R-rated fare instead of films like this that are closer to PG. But for those who want good, clean entertainment and don't mind subtitles and lavish musical numbers, this film makes for a good choice.\n",

            "Bollywood Movies in the 80s and 90s were done to death with the same theme. In the 80s and 90s period, films had the same villainy act, the same old revenge act by the hero after his family gets killed, and the same old romance between hero and heroine. Back then, movies were also quiet sexist as actresses were not given important roles but this is was the 80s and 90s period, can't really do anything to change it. However, there were many some films that were good despite belonging to these previous decades. Divya Shakti is definitely one of them and despite being a box office flop, the film lives up to it's expectations.Divya Shakti released in 1993 when Ajay Devgan gave a streak of flops. Most of these Ajay Devgan films were either badly made ones like Ek Hi Raasta(1993) or average ones like Platform. Divya Shakti(from my point of view) was his only release in 1993 which I liked watching while the other 6 or 7 releases weren't worth watching.Divya Shakti is actually typical but better handled than most movies which follow the same theme. Despite the same old story, old injustice done to the hero, the film shows how crime is the winner of all situations in India. This is actually true, crime exists in India because these criminals aren't sent to prison. Either they are captured or they not even touched because the police are all bribed, the corrupt police and the corrupt system of India is the reason why crime is at it's highest point in India. I thought this film would be cringe worthy like Anth(1993) which has a similar story but it was actually quite average. Divya Shakti(released in the same year) is much more superior) Divya Shakti properly shows the common man who witnesses injustice daily but he can't do anything. However, after witnessing a murder, he decides to not be a common man and report. He decides to become an eye witness. This action completely ruins his life and after he has lost everything, he decides to take revenge. This is also well shown in the film, obviously anyone who tries to act against criminals are silenced. In Indian films, what the villains do is try to find the hero's weakness which is usually his sister and use this to their advantage.Direction by Sameer Malkan is good, he handles most scenes quite well. Despite the typical script, he handles the film well. The Ajay-Alok scenes are well handled, the Ajay-Amrish scenes are a highlight. However, the major weakness of the film is the love story between the lead pair. Sure Raveena makes the audience laugh carelessly dropping things down but her romance with Ajay is not well built. However, in general the film is good.Ajay Devgan was quite raw for in his early days and despite this, he does a brilliant job as Prashant. He shows the common man becoming a murder well. His expressions are good. Raveen Tandon is good but her role is sidelined, she doesn't have much to do. Amrish Puri is amazing, he is excellent as the villain Tau and nobody could have played this role better than him. Shakti Kapoor irritates as the nephew of Tau. The rest provide decent support.On the whole, Divya Shakti is a decent action film even for being a typical 90s flick. The film successfully shows how an ordinary man can become a killer due to circumstances. Overall, Divya Shakti does a good job despite being a flop.\n",

            "As adults or as grown-ups, people feel that their childhood was the golden period of their lives. More often than not you would find people reminiscing and thinking about all the fun they used to have in school, and all the fun that they could have-but didn't have. All this is fine, but ask a kid whether he feels that he is happy with the world around him, and the way his life is going on- more often or not you would not get an answer in the affirmative. A child's world is a really complex one, where each problem is like a stone thrown from the top of a hill. To the child at the bottom of the hill, it is a stone that is moving down with great thrust, threatening to hurt him and damage his life. On the other hand, to the adults at the top, the stone is nothing but a casual flick of the wrist- something innocuous, and something that does not deserve much attention. Adults really will never understand the plights of their kids, or rather will refuse to understand them, and rightly so- for they know that these silly issues would pass sooner than later, and the kid will realize his folly at giving it too much undue importance. But what they don't realize is that it is this very time when a child is most vulnerable, and any casual handling of the winds that- as per him- threaten to storm his life, may lead to deep effects on his psyche that may not wear off even when he grows up.Gulzar's 'Kitaab' is an exceptional reconstruction of a child's mind. It is a movie that is so thoughtful and so precise, that it seems like Gulzar had put himself in a child's mind to construct this story (or rather he might have taken some autobiographical references). It is story of a boy grappling with the world around him, and struggling to make sense of the things that happen and don't happen around him, in a manner that seems far off from what he thinks is logical. Babla (Master Raju in an unusual lead role for a Hindi movie) lives in Delhi with his elder sister (Vidya Sinha) and her husband (Uttam Kumar). He has been sent to the city that is far away from his hometown, by his mother, with the aim of giving him better education and a better environment to live in and blossom. A twelve year old righteous kid, Babla, who likes reading and writing more than the subjects he is asked to tackle in his school, is confused by the world around him. He fails to absorb the fact that the world expects children to get educated so that they can lead a respected life once they grow up and face the 'real world'. To him the street-side 'madari' kid seems to be in a better position for he is not made to attend school. To add to his confusion, he cannot understand why his mother has sent him away from her, and why his sister does not seem to have enough time for him. With the course of time he develops a stronger bond with his sister's husband who seems to care for him a lot more than even his sister. On the schooling front, he is frustrated by the constant stream of letters that the school keeps sending to his home, asking his guardians to reprimand him for the naughty deeds he never commits, but always gets blamed for by the teachers. His only respite from the worldly troubles is his best friend 'Paplu' with whom he enjoys the simple pleasures of life.But then all the things things bottle up inside his head and he runs away from his home and city, aiming to go back to his mother and his village, away from all the troubles and all the people who did not seem to understand how he felt. Kitaab is the story of his journey, and how he evolves and grows up within a span of two days. Gulzar presents the story in an innovative back and forth manner; setting it in the present and going back through flashbacks triggered by the things Babla observes during his journey. As with every Gulzar movie, there are some delightful songs (though not very well known), but very relevant to everything that the master was trying to say through this film. To talk about performances, Master Raju brings alive Babla on screen, and it won't be an understatement to say that his performance is one of the best ones ever in Hindi cinema. The rest of the cast is efficient; Uttam Kumar deserves special mention for pitching in with a heartwarming and earnest act as Babla's guardian, and the kid who plays Babla's best friend Paplu too does a great job (so does everyone actually).I can go on rambling about this movie, but instead of I will conclude with why everyone must watch this film- · You would have never such a thoughtful and sensitive tale on child psychology · This is Gulzar's best work by far (There are a few movies of his I am yet to see- but it would be tough to surpass this gem) · It will definitely lead you to remember some of the times spent in school · It will help you emerge (hopefully) as somewhat better human beings by the time the movie end- better parents (present and prospective) for sure· It is one of the best movies to have come out of Hindi cinema- a true classic, and sadly a very lesser known onePS: If you thought 'Udaan' was good (which it was admittedly), just watch this one!!\n",

I went with few friends none of us liked it although some of us like this kind of slow movies, but this was EMPTY! And quite honestly, I have seen lot of series on TV that addressed this kind of stories, and even compared to these series the move still is weak and pointless.

            "Hindi musical romance, set on Mauritius, deals with self-made businessman Shyam (Rajesh Khanna) and a love triangle whose other points are spoiled rich girl Ruku (Tina Munim) and wistful Radha (Padmini Kolhapure). Shyam sets things in motion by hiring Radha's father (Dr Shriram Lagoo), an untouchable, as his new accountant (Shyam is not into the caste thing at all), saving the little family from starvation. Radha finds religious parallels to their relationship and develops a deep devotion for Shyam. But he's not a particularly religious guy, so it's all lost on him, and he sure likes the looks of westernized Ruku (don't we all!), whom he marries with trappings that seem like vintage Vegas, except for the lack of skydiving Elvis illusionists. An ominous note is that Ruku does have a well-developed caste consciousness.However, while Ruku's wealthy father (Pran, in a rather perfunctory role) admires Shyam, her stepmother and step-uncle (sinister Prem Chopra) are afraid he has the same ambitions as their own: getting his hands on daddy's money. So trouble looms constantly for this marriage, and when it arrives, it comes in spades.The story is told mostly as a long flashback, while Shyam is in the dock on a trumped-up charge of bigamy. The DVD box unconscionably gives away the ending of the film, which I didn't like, but not half as much as I didn't like the ending itself. The 12-stringer would have written this one very differently.The film is well-made and well-acted by all concerned, though I found some of the writing for Munim's character a bit inconsistent. Khanna is solid, and Chopra very effectively underplays his bad guy. He's quite convincing as a dude who believes in \"breaking rocks with glass.\" Kolhapure, a young teenager when the film was made, gives a highly charismatic performance that makes me want to see a lot more of her work. I wish her character had a little feistiness, though that would have made for a different story -- yeah, the one _I'd_ have written. (Note that the IMDb credits, and ergo the synopsis given here, erroneously reverse the roles played by Munim and Kolhapure in the film.)As par for a Hindi film, Souten is quite long, almost 3 hours. The first (a Holi celebration) and last (part of that lousy ending) musical numbers were my favorites. DVD quality is OK, though the image seems to be slightly cropped -- not intrusive for the much greater part. (The trailer is in 'scope, the feature itself in 1.85:1.) Lay in a box of Kleenex before you watch this; you'll thank me for that tip. And DON'T READ THE [several expletives deleted] DVD BOX SYNOPSIS!!!On the IMDb scale, I give this a 7, even though I didn't like the ending. Or did I already mention that?\n",

            "Mumbai 125 km is a film that could not handled even till the interval.The movie was awful from the selection of actors till the use of stereoscopic 3D. Of course you cannot expect a horror movie like those in Hollywood but this movie even failed the Bollywood standards. With a very weak story line and even badder way of story telling, the director should consider a makeover. You get very bored with the pitiful and cheap jolts. For example-: a scene where a ghost suddenly appears on your left and goes back on the deck. That scene was filled with very disturbing music. If you are a fan of Hollywood horror, this movie might be a joke for you. In conclusion, it's a movie with has nothing to do with scare factor or nothing to do with horror factor. You might go for the movie if you are long thirsty of some horror but in all, this movie just is a way beyond anyone's expectations.\n",

            "Well-respected rich guy is also a crime lord. He gets his goons to orchestrate a diamond heist, in which he gets double-crossed. As a result, bodies stack up, the diamonds are missing (and hidden in the titular Mumbai horse carriage Victoria No. 203), an innocent man is in jail for a crime he didn't commit, and now his daughter has to fend for herself. Oh, yeah, and there's tension between the rich guy and his son, and then his son meets the daughter of the innocent man...All sounds very typical, right? All sounds cliché and predictable, right? So why am I rating this move 8/10? Quite simply, this movie belongs to Ashok Kumar and Pran. If there's one thing that none of the characters in this film predict, it's that they would have to deal with the fast-talking fresh-out-of-jail bumbling old crooks Raja and Rana. Pran's Rana, who is funny in his own right, plays the straight man to Ashok Kumar's Raja, a perpetually drunk skirt-chasing buffoon, and these two make up perhaps my favorite comedic duo in all of Bollywood history. (I have actually come to refer to any hilarious comedic duo as \"Raja and Rana\".) When these two get thrown into the mix, this standard thriller plot suddenly takes a dramatic turn and sheer hilarity ensues.This movie simply could not have worked without Raja and Rana and I don't think Raja and Rana could have worked if they hadn't been cast properly. This is especially true for Raja, as he is played by Ashok Kumar, an actor known for playing wise grandfatherly figures or strong authority figures (think Judge Badri Prasad in \"Kanoon\"). For him to play Raja, who goes chasing after women half his age and looks utterly ridiculous doing so, is a complete inversion of expectations, and that is exactly what is needed in solid comedy. And, here he is paired up with Rana, known in Bollywood for playing cheesy villains (not to mention the wise and elderly Malan-chaha from Manoj Kumar's classic \"Upkar\"). The duo's antics and especially their fast-paced dialogue (not to mention their classic musical number \"Do Bichare Bina Sahare\") bring a smile to my face just remembering them.Raja and Rana are still supporting characters in this story, with the plot being driven by Navin Nischol as Kumar, the rich villain's good-guy son, Saira Banu as Rekha, the daughter-turned-carriage-driver, and Anwar Hussain as Durgadas, the rich villain. These performances would be considered weak for a thriller, but they are perfect for a comic thriller (or, perhaps, a comedy-masquerading-as-a-thriller) like this movie.You don't watch this movie for the plot or for a thrill. You watch it because you get to see two of Bollywood's most serious actors do a complete inversion and become geniuses of comedy.\n",

            "Mere Mehboob starts with the above-mentioned highly romantic encounter of Anwar (Rajendra Kumar) and Husna (Saadhana) in the college campus. Now Anwar is in search of his sweetheart whose fingers (or hand) only were seen by him and left their imprint on his heart. He sings a song expressing his restlessness to see her - Mere Mehboob Tujhe Meri Mohabbat Ki Kasam, Phir Mujhe Nargisi Aankhon Ka Sahaara De De - in the auditorium of the college (in a poetry contest) and wins the heart of his lost sweetheart who is seeing and listening to him while sitting there as a part of the audience. She at once comes to understand that the dashing youth singing on the mike is addressing to none else but herself only.Fate and the efforts of Anwar's Hindu friend, Ghaayal (Johnny Walker), bring Anwar and Husna together. Anwar who is the younger brother of a ordinary stage dancer, Najma (Nimmi) gets the job to tutor poetry to Husna who is the younger sister of an erstwhile Nawaab (king), Akhtar (Ashok Kumar). Despite their communication during the tutoring is without face-to-face contact (because as per the Muslim tradition, Husna remains in Parda or behind the veil), they recognize each other but some mistaken identities lead to Husna's friend, Naseem (Ameeta) falling in love with Anwar. The female friends tell about their respective Mehboobs (beloveds) to each other without knowing that their beloved is the same male. One more angle of the story is that Akhtar himself is in love with Najma and had saved her from getting spoiled due to lack of family and monetary support. But since she is a stage-dancer which is not considered a respectable profession by him, he is mentally not prepared to marry her because of the repute of his royal family. Nawaab Akhtar is impressed by the personality of Anwar and he engages Husna to him but upon knowing that he is Najma's younger brother, he breaks the engagement because of his (hollow) family honour. There is also a villain (Pran) in the movie who wants to take the advantage of the deteriorating financial condition of Nawaab Akhtar and compel him to marry Husna to him. However the climax of the movie ensures that both the loving couples (Anwar and Husna as well as Akhtar and Najma) unite.The decade of sixties was inarguably Saadhana's decade. Her Choodidaar Paayjaamas (tight-fitting trousers containing crinkles) were perfect for her hourglass figure and they, alongwith her famous hairdo, had made her the icon of fashion in those days. Being a Sindhi (full name Saadhana Shivadaasani), she was very fair and her sharp features ensured that she was a treat to watch and any guy would fall for her. Her proficient acting was the icing on the cake. Despite being a Sindhi, she portrayed a Muslim girl with such a finesse in this movie that you can't imagine any other actress in the role of Husna which was a perfect screen-name for her (Husna means full of beauty). In addition to Saadhana, all the principal characters, viz. Rajendra Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Nimmi, Ameeta, Johnny Walker, Pran etc. have done complete justice to their respective roles. Raj Kapoor's discovery - Nimmi (through Barsaat - 1949) was near the sunset of her career and she has played the perfect affectionate elder sister to Rajendra Kumar the same way Ashok Kumar has played the perfect elder brother to Saadhana. During the sixties, nobody could beat Rajendra Kumar in romantic roles and he had a great on-screen chemistry with Saadhana. Mere Mehboob is considered as one of his memorable movies. Ameeta has played second fiddle to Saadhana in this movie but she is not only pretty but also very impressive in her performance.Mainly, the movie scores because of the songs. Though most of the songs interrupt the flow of the story, because of them only, watching this movie is turned into a musical journey for the viewer. The best song is definitely the one in the title of this review and which forms the premise of the original romantic sequence of the movie. In addition to that, Rafi has delivered two more gems in this movie - Aye Husn Zara Jaag Tujhe Ishq Jagaaye and Tumse Izhaar-E-Haal Kar Baithe. Yaad Mein Teri Jaag Jaag Ke Hum is a great Rafi-Lata duet. Mangeshkar sisters - Lata and Asha have sung two beautiful songs jointly - Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahin and Jaaneman Ek Nazar Dekh Le. It also contains Lata's beautiful romantic song - Tere Pyar Mein Dildaar Jo Hai Mera Haal-E-Jaar. Allah Bachaye Naujawaano Se sung by Lata and chorus is also no less. The great music has been composed by Naushad whereas the touching lyrics have come from the pen of Shakeel Badayuni. The picturization of the songs is also admirable. We can feel the romance when the song - Aye Husn Zara Jaag Tujhe Ishq Jagaaye - runs on the screen. The movie has a high production value and except the length which could have been reduced, the technical aspects are topnotch. The movie provides a glimpse into the life of Lucknow - the City of Tehzeeb (culture) as it might have been those days. And finally, the movie is memorable because of the mesmerizing romance. If you are interested in the nostalgia of old-fashioned romance, Mere Mehboob is just for you. Just experience how much can be said through the eyes, the heartbeats and the silence prevailing between the lovers.\n",

            "\"Raja Jani\" should have been called Rani Jani or something. It is quite an enjoyable flick of 1970's Hindi cinema: very colourful, very entertaining, basically the perfect one for nostalgic fans of the genre and the time. This film starts with Raja (Dharmendra) who tries to find a girl who would be a perfect impostor to take the place of the missing princess Ratna. During an assassination of her parents she disappeared, and during the last ten years her grandmother, queen Rajmata has been looking for her. Raja finds a street dancer named Shanno, and finally, after extensive training, she enters the house as the long awaited princess. What he does not know is something that may spoil his intentions to get the money through her, and it is revealed later (you may guess what it could be). Well, the story is narrated nicely - nothing exceptional but still interesting enough. Dharmendra is very good as Raja, but the film belongs to Hema Malini, who is also the film's main and perhaps only attraction. She is such a beautiful lady, such a talented actress, and such an awesome comedienne that whether the film is particularly good or not does not matter. Raja Jani has been with me since childhood, and I still like it and attribute this to Hema Malini.\n",

            "Piya ka Ghar is a Hindi comedy set (mainly) in Mumbai in the 1970s. It is supposedly a remake of Raja Thakur's Marathi film \"Mumbaicha Javai.\" It portrays the difficulties of life in India's biggest city in the form of a comic family drama.This is one of my favourite old Hindi movies and though almost forty years have passed since this movie was made, watching it is still a pleasant way of spending a few hoursI can still relate to the movie, though it was made a good six years before I was even born After having watched it quite a few times on the television over the years, I decided to download the film and add it to my collectionI have a few other gems in my collection such as Choti si Baat, Chupke Chupke, Golmal, Naram Garam, Bawarchi and this movie is cut from the same cloth The film is quite breezy and simplistic, containing no antagonists, scheming relatives or friends, no subplots and moves forward in a straight forward manner It focuses on a north Indian, immigrant middle class family living in a crowded, noisy apartment building (commonly known as a Chawl) in Bombaythe family consists of the male patriarch, his wife, their three sons and the wife of the eldest sonthey are in general a happy-go-lucky family, leaving peacefully in the midst of their chaotic surroundingsthey are also in search of a bride for their second son Ram (Anil Dhawan), who is the male lead They forge an alliance for Ram with Malti (Jaya Bhaduri), who lives in a villagethe manner in which the match-maker exonerates the virtues of the prospective bride-groom and his family to Malti's parents is one of the most hilarious scenes in the movieHe paints a very rosy picture of the family staying in dream city Bombay in a palatial building, near the sea-shore, thereby pushing hard for an alliance Malti's Tauji (Uncle), who is extremely fond of her opposes the alliance as he does not have a good opinion of Bombay & its inhabitantshis first meeting with the members of the groom's family (when they arrive for the wedding) does not help matters and he regards them as boorish and ill-manneredhowever the wedding does take placeOnce Ram brings his bride to Bombay, she quickly adjusts to her new life with the help of her supportive in-lawsbut the newly-weds do not get the privacy they desire and attempts by the rest of the family to help them also back-firesthese somewhat funny and poignant efforts at romance forms the main plot line of the movie Though, both are frustrated, Malti especially is disheartened, though she is otherwise quite happy & well-adjustedWhen her Tau visits Bombay to meet her, he finds her in tears and is convinced that the whole marriage has been a terrible mistakehe decides to take her back to the village and even though the whole family pleads with him, he is adamant At this point, not only Ram's family members, but also his neighbours decide to sacrifice substantially for Malti's happinessthis act of utter selflessness by others touches her deeply and she tells her Tau that though she loves him a lot, she is quite content & happy in marriagethis opens his eyes and leads him to realize that he has misunderstood the situation, because of his deep love for Malti The film explores many aspects of life in a crowded city such as the struggle for privacy and romance, the selflessness and noble-hearted behavior of people who seem unsophisticated and ill-mannered, stark contrast between life in a village and a city etcit has some beautiful songs which are quite relevant to the situations in the movie An additional bonus is that you get to see Bombay as it was in the early seventiescomic relief in the movie is provided by veterans such as Agha, Keshto Mukherjee, Mukri and PaintalAnil Dhawan is quite handsome and fits the role of the romantically inclined, newly wed city boy while Jaya Bhaduri breathes life in her role of the coy and introvert Village belleI especially liked the character of Anil Dhawan's bhabhi (played by Ranjita Thakur), which is quite saucy and naughty, even slightly flirtatiousshe enjoys teasing the newly weds I would recommend this movie for everybodywatching it will definitely brighten up your day and lift your spiritsit is a film which asks for repeated viewings It is a pity that nobody makes such simple hearted movies which entertain and also carry a social message\n",

Lets be honest, the plot of famous personality visiting the small- town is \"Billu Barber\" and the simplicity of the characters is \"Welcome to Sajjanpur\". Only difference is the reality check on the super-star who is big-bad-wold reincarnate. Technically the movie is perfect, the screenplay should have been tempered a bit more on the edges to arrive at a golden finish. At the end, it leaves the audience desiring for more. Rishi Kapoor: In all honesty, only Rishi Kapoor could have carried off this role. A perfect blend of fact with fiction for his characterisation.Priyanshu:: Carried his role quite well actually. Neha Kaul:: Its nice to see the small-screen Preiti Zinta migrate to big screen. Her choice of costumes deserve a special mention and sadly not the same can be said about her makeup. The romantic track seemed jumping the gun a bit too quickly. Kseniya Ryabinkina:: I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the \"Mera Naam Joker\" lady making a very-very special appearance in this one.Sophiya:: Had a few more lines in addition to the so-called item number.

            "The first thing about this movie that glares you in the face is that it is made on a very low budget. That's not a crime, but accompanying it with loud performances and a pathetic storyline is.The story is simply about a teenaged girl desperate to meet her father since childhood. Reason she hasn't met him: he was poor, they had a hidden affair, the rich mother's father did not approve of it, so he that is, the nanaji decided to adopt his grand daughter as his own daughter. ??? After this twisted plot, we are taken to a scene where the girl goes to college and is verbally bullied for being an illegitimate child. Perhap's I would feel some sympathy for her if it was not for the terrible performance by the lead actor.She simply shrieks her way through the film. She is the ultimate tantrum queen, who seeks to manipulate and use every person on her path to meet with her goals. She is selfish, rude and cowardly. And all of this only to make you realize the importance of being disciplined by a father. So I should turn a blind eye to the fact that she has lived in a family comprising of elders, and not alone in a marooned island??? Anyway, as faith would have it, she meets her father in a very miraculous encounter (a very poorly written plot), and also the love of her life played by the cute looking Jugal Hansraj. The film then goes into a weak attempt at being comic and cutesy at the same time. Jugal hardly has a role, and that too he portrays without any effort. And how can I forget the ventriloquist's puppet that the heroine carries with her at all times? It's irritating! This movie really suffers from a mindless plot, and a very bad performance by the lead actors. Yet, I am giving it two stars. One, for Anupam Kher's ever brilliant performance. And second, for the outstanding music by Rajesh Roshan. Never mind the poor visualization, the audio is for keeps.I was amazed to know that this low budget affair was directed by Mahesh Bhatt.

This is truly Mithun's comeback film. He proved his high caliber and extraordinary talent, which I was completely unaware of. Elaan and Lucky didn't showcase his talent at all. The story is bold, and Lajmi courageously exposes an injustice in the Indian villages prevalent since the beginning of society where hypocrites like the priest played by Mithun thoroughly exploit the caste system and play the role of God, giving an ultimatum on every issue in the village while womanizing and abusing prostitutes at night. However, despite all of the film's strengths, these issues have been tackled numerous times in Bollywood. This film, particularly its climax, reminded me a lot of Daman. What is also irritating is that Chingaari is in the form of a narrative. At times it becomes extremely boring. I think Lajmi didn't do a good job converting from a theater production to a cinema format. I would prefer to see this on the stage than on DVD.\n",

Firstly all three characters Sudeep, Chhaya and Modi have gray shades, but the lightest amongst them was Sudeep but he was the one made guilty in the end. That was disheartening.1. In the film it is shown, that on a fit of despair, Sudeep just says once that, Chhaya should get married to Modi, after Modi dies, they can reunite. It was not as if they both sat and plotted a scheme or outlined a plan. After that day, Chhaya never met Sudeep and remained at home contemplating, and then took a decision to instantly agree for marriage to Modi, at a fit of rage/disappointment and for money of her brother's foreign studies. After that she did not even feel her duty to repay her half of the loan, which she and Sudeep had taken for the apartment. After marriage, she became the perfect wife. Went to kitty parties, to holiday trips to cool village, but yet remembering in sub-conscious about the simple man, she left for money. Sudeep on the other hand was toiling to make both ends meet to repay the debt and at the same time feeling dejected and frustrated about his love's labor lost.Now the other angle. 2. Mr.Modi (who is almost 50-55yrs) is the person who knows he does not have much time to live, yet he decides to hire his dead wife's look-alike Chhaya (19 yrs old) as a typist in his office. He is selfish and only thinks about his own enjoyment/companionship until his death. He asks Chhaya to marry her, fully knowing that Sudeep and Chhaya were in love. After marriage, he tries to act God by showing off, of helping Sudeep with his debt. And the most meaningless action of this character, is he left his wallet, trying to be a sacrificing man, who can let his wife go, if she wants to (in the end). Come on! if he is that much let-go-er, they he should not have married Chhaya in the first place. And to top it all, in the end, he goes with his wife to station and says to Sudeep, that he has lost the battle of love because Sudeep wanted short-cuts!! May be his heart-blockage is causing delusion about himself.Both, Chhaya and Modi in the end made Sudeep feel, as if he was the one walking the wrong path. I must say to Sudeep, Chhaya does not deserve you. She is one of those girls who act very innocent yet they exactly know what they want.I am fine with the movie, as long as it is not sited as Modi and Chhaya are the perfect couple with Indian (pseudo) values, which I think the writer/director wanted to show in the end. On the contrary to the regular audiences' belief, for me this movie has a very negative ending, which only shows shortcut success of ambition of Ladies and Rich Men.\n",

The movie wasn't a mystery. It was a story of a man for whom his world was his wife. He even loses his eyesight on the pretext of saving her life. But what does he get in return? Taking advantage of his blindness, his wife stages an illicit affair with his own friend. A friend who claims to be his best friend. Love-grieved by her unfaithfulness, back-stabbed by his friend and with physical disability, it could have been easy for him to continue what has been going on. But he decides to teach both of them a lesson. How he does that forms rest of the plot. Till this point the movie is good. From here on the movie turns out excellent. This movie is underrated and did not get the applause it deserved. A superb performance by late Haribhai, as a blind man plotting a task which would seem impossible for a blind person. He was a gem of an actor and had he been alive for few more years, we could have seen more of his good performances. Alas. The story is well written and well executed. Rest of the cast(Sarika, Ranjeeta and Marc Zuber) have justified their characters. The movie lacks in technicality. The picturization and presentation were not to the mark where the story was. This could be due to low budget. Overall, this movie is not worth missing for Haribhai's fans. If you are not his fan, after watching the movie you surely will be.\n",

            "Its a story of a lower middle class happy nuclear family. The lady of the family gets involved in prostitution, owing to the not so good financial condition of the family. It is the story of the guilt that comes with the money and the cobweb that such a route entails that its quite an effort to come out of the profession once one enters it.This movie has many things to take it from, but lets first discuss the story line. The story line is quite weak at times. The most important scene of her starting all this is unconvincingly shown. However one may argue (and I argued the same thing with myself when I saw it the second time) that this is how it looks like if someone watches a real person go through all this. It feels unconvincing. And thats how it feels in the movie.But other than some of that, the movie and many dialogues have far reaching connotations. The movie talks about man's endless desire to acquire, rather beautifully. It tries to separate needs and conveniences. It also touches on the sexual imbalance existing between couples. One line that I always remember from this movie goes something like this \"Slowly and slowly husbands and wives start sharing their habits much more than they share their thoughts and this distances them\".Anyhow, this is a not a great one, but a worth see anyway. It might not be the full money's worth but it might initiate a much needed thought process.\n",

Also this movie entails about Blind faith, how people follow anyone thinking they are God but thy are actually trying to scam people. Hardly there are any songs in the movie.

            "The time has come when filmmakers struggle to find the right title for their films. But here, the makers have tried a googly to attract people towards their film - with a title that gives us a fair idea about what one should expect. Alas, the film has nothing to do with a girlfriend.The story is about Dhruv (Sharma), a skirt-chasing nimrod, trying to woo insurance agent Sakshi (Mishra) by availing one of her insurance schemes to buy a car he doesn't need or has the ability to buy. The blink-and-you-miss character of Sakshi is the closest the film gets in developing the \"girlfriend\" that is mentioned in the title, who is supposed to be \"zaalim\" (cruel). The film is nothing about a man supposedly being imposed cruelty by his girlfriend, but is something right out of the plot of a potboiler of early 2000s. Dhruv finds out that he is unable to pay the EMIs, so the loan shark Minocha (Shroff) sends his men to steal the car, repaint it, and sell it to another customer. And all this takes place in Delhi.So, if we were to appropriately rename the film, it should have been Zaalim Dilli or Zaalim Mumbai or Zaalim Chennai or Zaalim Hyderabad, for the events that the writers have churned out isn't exclusive to Delhi, for cryin' out loud. Loan sharks are everywhere, and they cheat people everywhere. Why make a film that showcases social issues for the heck of it? And even if you do, why the cliché?Unfortunately, nothing works out for Japinder Kaur Baweja as she aimlessly directs her protagonists (yes, there are 3 of them now) who move around in Delhi, screaming out stupid dialogs and carrying out an implausible sting operation to get back that car which has already been repainted yellow and sold to a scumbag of a kid. There is this annoying background music that plays throughout the film, irrespective of the sequence. I wonder if it was Miss Japinder's cousin who produced this background score that will make A R Rahman move to catering.There are some random social issues that are being addressed here, but if you are searching for something original, go watch Court (2015) that will probably hit the theaters in April 2015. The cast don't help much, and if Jackie Shroff doesn't stop behaving like this, I'm afraid he's going to permanently damage his rough-stuff type image. Playing a malevolent and debauching villain isn't the best element to create humor. Ira Dubey seemed like the only wise person in the whole of film cast and crew.BOTTOM LINE: There is no entertainment to be expected from this poorly made comedy drama that, for starters, is nothing like it claims to be.

The movie will make you experience the Goan Portuguese culture, their lifestyle, their music (watch out for the young Remo Fernandez and Alisha Chennai in 1985), and in the end, you feel as if you have actually experienced the entire happening. The costumes, the names, the behavior of the characters are all very authentic, and one thing is for sure, the next time you are in Goa, you will pause and think for a second about its unique and diverse culture and the place it holds in the Indian history.\n",

It tells the allegoric tale of Abdullah from the fictional town of minye in Egypt. Abdullah tries to lead a pious life, but in a autocratic society, this makes him a suspect, his pious activities dissension. this situation is pretty similar to the life of the author of the book, hekimoglu ismail and the historic troubles many pious Turks have had.This helped in making it a financial success, more than the quality of the film itself. As it stands, the movie is hampered by overacting actors and clichés.

Still today, after fourteen years, I love this movie. It is a comparatively unknown movie. The movie is a love story.Arun is a final year student in the college. Shalni, a class fellow falls in love with him. She is a good poet. She sends her poetry to college magazine and Arun incidentally reads it. Her poetic name is Seema. Arun has a great respect for Seema because he has sung Seema's poem in the college annual function and becomes popular. He and Shalni has a bad relationship in college and he does not know that Shalni loves him. After his completion of masters, he wants to find a job as he has no one in the world and he was studying on scholarship. In this period of crises, Shalni plans with her friend that why not she should help him build his career as a singer. But she does not want herself to be known to Arun as his career maker. She writes songs in magazines and collects funds for Arun's shows. Basically all the money is her. And then Arun becomes a star. What happens next I think should be known by watching the movie.

            "This isn't the first movie of Helen, but her entrance here, at about age 19, feels like a triumphant introduction - slim as a reed, with a young girl's face made up lightly, just to emphasize the tilt of her eyes, she glides down a staircase in a Chinese costume to perform Meera Naam Chin Chin Chu, an all-time great Hindi cinema song. I think the movie is worth owning for this and for Madhubala in an Ava Gardner-like incarnation, singing and dancing in full-skirted lush western dresses.An unusual film to me -- it seems to be a Bollywood effort at a noir-style mystery story. I'd say the \"noir\" element is present in the milieu and the cinematography more than in the story itself. The world of the story is a world of seedy small hotels and nightclubs in Calcutta. Most of the main dramatic scenes are interiors of these places at night, and people are always moving in and out of light that casts various shadows on their faces.A dramatic chase scene makes great use of the Howrah Bridge, an imposing Erector-Set structure that is a Calcutta landmark.There's also a style of Indian Orientalism here, as well I think as a use of some motifs from LA noir of this time period - there is a Chinese villain, played well by an Indian actor (i.e. not the random bowing slant-eyed stereotype we run into here and there in other movies) and the first part of the story takes place in Rangoon, its characters' home - so there are many references to \"oriental exotic\" outside of India.Not unusually and not surprisingly, the story lacks the things that make noir noir - we've got our stereotypes moving around, doing things and reacting to things, and we don't have any of the moral ambiguity of the American film noir, where a hero without conventional social moorings has his own ethics, and a woman probably will not turn out to be who she seems to be. We do, though, have wonderful 50s western costumes on the primary characters, as well as Indian-style masala characters who sing, dance, and have a wedding which Madhubala stops to watch when she is pursuing someone.The story also sticks mostly to the characters involved in the mystery - Ashok Kumar, Madhubala, a Tonga-wallah who is Ashok's guide into the more mysterious parts of Calcutta; the Chinese art dealer, and the man named Joe who owns a hotel and makes claims on owning Madhubala too. There is also the opium-smoker who witnessed the murder, and his lovely fiancé. But there are no extra relatives bringing in \"emotion,\" which, for India, does stick to the noir mystery format and to the single plot line to an exceptional degree.The basic story: Ashok Kumar, in Rangoon, learns that his brother has apparently stolen the precious family heirloom dragon statuette, and soon thereafter learns the brother has been killed in the course of his effort to sell it, so he travels to Calcutta to try to reclaim the thing and solve the mystery.Along the way he meets Madhubala, who sings and dances in a hotel. At an early point I think we were meant to wonder whose side she was on, beyond that, the plot lost me somewhat, and I also don't think it was totally coherent but may be wrong. If someone else watches the whole thing, I'd like to know if you think the existence of the duplicate Family Heirloom really had anything to do with anything that happened.Anyhow enjoy it for its eight songs, Helen (in just the one), and Madhubala.\n",

            "Here is a fun story targeted to and completely appropriate for a child audience, yet intelligently written and engaging enough for adults, too.\"Main Krishna Hoon\" is a heartwarming tale which ties the rich tradition of ancient Indian culture surrounding the god Krishna with the very real-world challenges of a very real little boy also named Krishna.One dark and rainy night, the kindly proprietors of a small orphanage – Kantaben (Juhi Chawla) and Nattubhai (Paresh Ganatra) – rescue an abandoned baby boy from the floodwaters. They name him Krishna, because the way they found him parallels the legend of how the god Lord Krishna came to live with his adoptive parents as a baby. Orphan Krishna (Namit Shah) lives happily in the orphanage with Kanta and Nattu and the other foundling children. But over the years, as one by one his other friends are adopted out to families but he remains, young Krishna comes to believe that he is unadoptable, unwanted, and will never find a family. In despair, all alone one night he goes to a temple and prays to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna (animated) then comes to Earth in his mischievous childhood 'butter thief' avatar and befriends the young orphan Krishna. Many adventures then ensue, as Krishna-from-Heaven helps Krishna-from-Earth discover his family.The 'makhan chor' Lord Krishna is charmingly designed and animated. He may be a god, but he never lets you forget that he is also himself a mischievous little boy, too. Animated Krishna's dual-level interactions with his new friend, orphan Krishna (well-played by debutant child actor Namit Shah), are not only engaging and believable but genuinely fun. The business with the kheer (rice pudding), for instance. Or what becomes the obsession of both Krishnas with their namesake Krishna character who becomes a superhero, as played by actor Hrithik Roshan in the \"Krrish\" movies.Juhi Chawla's performance here is outstanding, as the kindly headmistress of the orphanage. Even at her most perky and deliberately positive, you feel Kantaben's genuine love and caring for her young charges. Paresh Ganatra as her male counterpart is played more for comedy. But as the story progresses, the audience see and feel that he, too, shares her deep-seated concern for the orphans' longterm future.Adults will particularly enjoy how ingeniously two real-world Hindi film superstars – first Katrina Kaif, later Hrithik Roshan – are cleverly worked into the story in 5-minute appearances as their actual selves.(First-time producers Nandan K. Mahto & Promila Hunter are the longtime spot boy and hairdresser, respectively, of Mr Roshan and Ms Kaif, which is why the two superstars both readily agreed to support and be a part of their old friends' debut movie. In industry terms such high-profile commitment would have been key to securing both funding and distribution for the project.)But throughout \"Main Krishna Hoon\", experienced children's director Rajiv S. Ruia (the \"My Friend Ganesha\" movie series) keeps the focus on children and completely child-friendly for all ages.For instance, when actual villains are introduced into the story (in reference to the legendary battle of Krishna with the tyrant Kans) director Ruia presents the historic Krishna-Kans battle solely as animation, which lessens the potential fear factor to a child audience. The live action equivalent 'Kans' – gangleader Angar Singh (Raj Premi), his lieutenant Paddu Singh (Rajan Verma), and their goons – are kept light and played for comedy. Even the gang's crimes are deliberately made crimes with which child audiences can instantly identify.This is the sort of refreshingly straightforward movie where, if 'The Hero' doesn't exactly ride into town on a white horse, he at least rides in on its 21st century equivalent!The music by Amjad–Nadeem is generally good.Juhi Chawla herself beautifully sings 'Om Namo Namah' over the opening credits, as we watch the infant orphan Krishna grow into the boy (Namit Shah) we will follow for the rest of the story.The title track, 'Main Krishna Hoon', is catchy and stays with you.A particular highlight is 'Govinda Aala Re'. The song is choreographed by ace dance director Ganesh Acharya against a traditional dahi handi human pyramid festival celebrating the birthday of young Lord Krishna. Aspiring stars Rajneesh Duggal and Misti Mukherjee appear briefly as the featured male and female dancers for this song.Hindi cinema badly needs more good movies for children, which their parents can also enjoy. \"Main Krishna Hoon\" delivers!\n",

            "Benegal's 'Sardari Begum' follows the same line of Benegal's 'Zubeidaa'. Both films are said to be part of a trilogy of which the third film is 'Mammo'. I haven't seen 'Mammo' but while both 'Zubeidaa' and 'Sardari Begum' tell the story of an enigmatic woman who lived her life on her own terms, the latter film is a lot less polished and much more raw. This only adds to the somberness and deglamour of the film making it look much more real. While the glamour works very well in 'Zubeidaa' as it deals with the upper class, the lack of it works for 'Sardari Begum' as it deals with the middle class.Benegal is already known as a masterful storyteller, especially when it concerns women. Here he certainly does not let his viewer down. the writing is brilliant and the characters are very interestingly defined as we see them from different perspectives. The editing is crisp.He extracts some fine performances from his actors. This is perhaps the first role that does full justice to Kiron Kher's talent. She's simply phenomenal. In the title role, Smriti Mishra does a very good job. Rajeshwari Sachdev too standouts especially in the final sequences. Newcomer Rajina Raj Bisaria adds a freshness with a sincere performance. Rajit Kapoor, Salim Ghouse and Amrish Puri lend sufficient support.The songs are very simplistic, created with beautiful lyrics and minimal use of instruments. The cinematography, especially the use of the zoomlens shot from multiple angles is very effective.Like 'Zubeidaa', 'Sardari Begum' is a beautiful film. It's just a different kind of beautiful.

            "A wonderful, wonderful premise where an out-and-out mainstream Hindi film revolves around the romantic relationship between two middle-aged people. Both are in their mid-to-late 40s (or probably more, in his case), both are widowed and have grown up kids. Their relationship is just beautifully portrayed, and yes, there's indeed an added value in portraying the romantic affair between two people of their age, making it far more interesting and refreshing than your run-of-the-mill mainstream rom-coms. The big flaw in this film is that despite the modern setting of new-age, urban families, at the end of the day when the relationship between the two leads is revealed, it becomes an issue among the kids, which is weird. I highly doubt any person of their social milieu would consider it wrong. In this regard, a fresh concept goes really downhill by becoming a reversed version of Bobby, where instead of parents, it is the children who oppose the relationship, which doesn't really ring true.Where the film does score is in the casting of the two leads, Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia. The two have a perfect chemistry which takes one right back to the magic of their Bobby days in the early 1970s (I think Saagar wasn't a very successful film in this regard). Kapadia is a delight, just a delight all the way - stunning, with extraordinarily commanding screen presence, and always so real. The late Rishi Kapoor was at his very best in the latter phase of his career as a character actor, as it brought the best in him and revealed his true acting prowess otherwise hidden under the fake 'hero' persona that he as every other Hindi film star had to playact. He is just excellent here, and it was just the beginning of many great performances that would follow. Indeed, the pairing of the two is marvelous, as they bring experience, familiarity and great nostalgic value. It really is reason enough to watch this otherwise poor film.The same cannot be necessarily said about the younger players, whose character are caricatures of selfish youngsters. Instead of making a film that would totally rest on the extraordinary pairing of the two main stars, and there's plenty to rest on considering how good they are, the film succumbs to the commercial film format by enhancing the stories of the young players. In so doing, it shows how lacking in confidence it is and how little it trusts its stars to captivate the audiences. On top of that, the young players are sadly just not up to the mark so instead of contributing to the film with their youthful presence, they actually take away a lot from its credibility and depth and make the entire product quite messy and lacking in focus and conviction. As said above, it is not their fault, the characters are just badly written. But who cares anyway, sometimes even weak films like this are more interesting to see than other seemingly better films when they have what this film has, a great nostalgic pair.\n",

Now this is a straight copy-paste of the 3 second sequence from the Hollywood Movie Swordfish starring Hugh Jackman, Travolta and Halle.The second and third shameless uplifted scene is from Mission Impossible : I The computer screen shows the Decibal meter and the third one shows \"Downloading NOC List\"These people can get sued by Dominic Sena (Director : Swordfish) and Brian De Palma (Director : Mission Impossible 1) because their movie frames were included as we all know without permission.

But working on this encouraging vision, many a times, scripts get approved which do sound interesting in narration or on paper but don't really turn up as even average entertainers on the screen. SOOPER SE OOPER is also one of those shaky projects, unable to make any kind of favorable impact on the viewers in its two hours of duration.Based on an interesting plot of the hero's journey to bring his Mama (Mother's elder brother) back to Mumbai from Rajasthan to get his property's claim papers signed, the film is loaded with almost everything required to make a good project. It has Vir Das(GO GOA GONE fame) who plays the person caught between his villager relatives and a cunning builder eager to take over his property. There is Gulshan Grover playing the Oxford returned learned Mama, Yashpal Sharma as Mama's devoted follower, Deepak Dobriyal & Tinnu Anand playing the builder mafia dons, Kirti as the pretty face and the team of Sonu Nigam-Bickram Ghosh making the soundtrack of the film probably for the first time.Further SSP has a decent cinematography, fine art direction and the vision of making a clean comedy (Shekhar Ghosh), clearly visible in few of its comic scenes too. Yet, nothing works in the desired manner throughout the film and it turns out to be neither a comedy nor a complete social drama in the end.

But after a good start as each of them start giving their viewpoint the plot gets disturbed and seems to be confused in its own web.Moreover the most annoying part comes when the film ends abruptly. Climax with many possibilities is acceptable but when the movie ends suddenly without any justification then its looks like deliberately done to give it an offbeat perspective.Performances wise Kay Kay and Vinay Pathak are fine as always. Proshanth Narayanan and Sandhya Mrudal excel. The rest are all there but nothing extraordinary to showcase. Sonali Kulkarni looks ravishing, Parvin Dabbas, Simone Singh and Rajat Kapoor are OK.One interesting observation. The movie has a subject very similar to Kurosawa's \"RASHOMON\". In fact it's a modernized version of the Black & White movie and in one scene Rajat Kapoor can be seen holding the DVD of this classic in his hand. May be it's the director's way of giving tribute to the master film-maker.\n",

            "I am shocked to read the news of Sushmita Bandyopaadhyaay's murder in today's newspaper. The Indian authoress who wrote her true life story in the shape of a novel - Kaabuliwaalar Bengali Bou (Kaabuliwaala's Bengali Wife) was shot dead by the Taalibaani militants outside her residence in the Paktika province of Afghanistan. Sushmita had fallen in love with an Afghan businessman - Jaanbaaz Khan and shifted from Kolkata to Kaabul in 1989 after marrying him. After the emergence of an Islamic fundamentalist militant organization titled as Taalibaan (students) in 1993 and its capturing administrative powers, reducing the formal political regime to almost naught, life became hell for Sushmita there with certain very painful truths about her husband also coming out to fore which were hitherto unknown to her. She managed her escape from there through a lot of toil, hardship and struggle and penned down that phase of her life in the form of the above-mentioned book. This book got used as the basis of a Bollywood movie which is Escape from Taliban (2003).Directed by Ujjwal Chatterjee, Escape from Taliban features Manisha Koiraala in the lead role and Ali Khan in the role of her husband. The lady protagonist, i.e., Sushmita marries her Afghani lover despite opposition from her Bengali Hindu family but when moved to Afghanistan with him, she is horrified to see humanity being butchered in every particle of the land where it's a crime to be a non-Muslim and it's even greater crime to be a woman. She is rechristened as Sayeeda after conversion and gives birth to a baby child while living with her in-laws. Her humanitarian heart weeps for the oppressed innocents in this barbaric land. Some hidden truths about her husband also get revealed to her. Now she wants to be back to her motherland, i.e., India with her daughter but it's a Herculean task. How she is able to make this great escape happen forms the remaining part of the story.Over the past two decades of their reign, Taalibaan seems to be willing to take the world to the medieval era and convert it into Daar-ul-Islaam (the land of Islaam) where everybody is Muslim and leads his / her life according to the Sharia rule (as interpreted by them). They do not believe in giving the basic human rights and the bare minimum respect to the non-Muslims as well as the females (of all categories and communities) as well as those who do not support their ideology. They are cruel. They are insensitive. We have the latest example of a little girl Malaala Yousufzai who was shot by them because she was promoting education among Muslim girls. And quite unfortunately, their biased and condemnable ideology is directly / indirectly supported by several Muslim leaders and organizations all over the world including the so-called secular India. Sushmita vividly portrayed the pitiable condition of non-Muslims and females (of Muslims and non-Muslims alike) in her book and Ujjwal Chatterjee who has written the screenplay of this movie also, has done the same by making the celluloid version of the book with sincerity and honesty.All the same, the movie is not an excellent one. It depicts reality and does not digress from its motive, nevertheless it's to be acknowledged that it could have been a much better one as the heart-tearing reality has not been portrayed with the amount of passion required for the purpose. The movie thrills more, moves less. With a better star cast and a better director, it could have been a masterpiece. At several places, the film appears to be just something above average which is sad considering the strength of the plot which is the much acclaimed book. The movie is technically okay though.Vanraaj Bhaatia's music and Mehboob Kotwaal's lyrics have not created any chartbusters but all the songs are meaningful, admirable and perfectly in sync with the mood of the movie.Manisha Koiraala has done well in the lead role. Ali Khan as her husband and the other members of the cast in various supporting roles have done justice to their work.While recommending this movie to all those who take interest in watching realistic, meaningful and purposeful movies, I wonder why Sushmita went back to that country after making such a daredevil escape from there. Perhaps because she was a sensitive lady and a true humanist and she went back only to help others like her. Ever since her return to the cursed land, Sushmita was ceaselessly busy in social work especially pertaining to women's healthcare and upliftment and that's what's not acceptable to the beasts who want to keep the half of the mankind as enslaved to the other half for eons to come.Sushmita could manage an escape from Taalibaan during the nineties but now she has succumbed to their cruelty with little hope that this great sacrifice of hers will bring about any positive change in Afghanistan or the thinking of the fundamentalist Muslim brotherhood at any place. While paying my tribute to the brave Indian authoress, I take this opportunity to make an appeal to all the humanists of the world to rise up against this barbarianism and imposition of the outdated thinking and inhuman practices on the world. The so-called secular Indians may still not break their silence (they are ready to adjust to anything undesirable done in the name of Islam for the sake of their secularism which is nothing but maintaining of double standards for Muslims and non-Muslims). However all the humanists should join hands to save humanity and innocence from Taalibaan and similar outfits.\n",

            "In this documentary, film-maker Damon Gameau becomes his own guinea pig and spends 60 days eating healthy foods with added sugar. Before this process, he had eradicated sugar from his diet so the contrast is even more pronounced. Over the course of the 60 days he puts on considerable weight, experiences mood swings and notices a drop in overall motivation.What I found so alarming about this film was that it didn't play things easy and simply expose the dangers of excessive sugar intake. Gameau doesn't consume any junk food whatsoever, such as fizzy juice, sweets or ice cream, he instead purely sticks to food marketed as healthy. It's this more than anything that sets off alarm bells because this route seems to most people a route to weight loss and improved physical well-being, yet as the film demonstrates it actually leads to obesity and mental damage. Time and again we are shown the volumes of sugar that is hidden in so-called 'healthy' foods and it makes you pause for thought. What comes out loud and clear is that sugar is clearly a socially acceptable form of addiction and the sugar industry have been instrumental in minimising public information on the dangers their product presents. It's very interesting to note that over the course of his 60 day experiment Gameau eats no more calories than he did previously, yet he puts on almost a stone in weight. One of the key lessons, therefore, is that there are calories and there are calories, i.e. sugar calories affect the body decidedly differently to the way protein and carb ones do.The approach taken by the film is very much of the fun and informative variety. Sometimes the humour doesn't work so well but in the main this approach is good in that it is very accessible. After all, this is a film that you would want children to watch and learn from. There are a couple of star cameos with Hugh Jackman giving us a brief history lesson about man's relationship with sugar and Stephen Fry pops up to explain some of the science behind it. On the whole, I found this to be an excellent wake-up call about a subject I had hitherto given minimal thought to. There is a lot of very valuable information in this film that could be genuinely life changing if applied to your day to day life, and I reckon that is as good a recommendation as anyone could need.\n",

            "I think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. I still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. Whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? No he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which one is the 'One' for him. What makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. When things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.This dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. In case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.\n",

            "Amrapali is a film often overlooked by movie lovers and critics alike.The movie flopped on it's initial release but watching it today I can't understand why this happened. The film charts the story of the court dancer, Amrapali, devoted to the royal family of her district. She falls in love and begins an intense relationship with a soldier who saves her life. Unknown to Amrapali the soldier is the prince from a neighboring district who are locked in an on-going and bloody war with the royal family that Amrapali serves.The film features a strong message on the futility of war. The movie delivers everything that an Indian film lover could ask for ... mind-blowing visuals, strong performances by all of the cast, a killer soundtrack and beautiful dances performed by Vyjanthimala. The movie is very difficult to find - but if you do track it down give it a viewing ... the last scene where Amrapali submits to Buddha in a touching sequence where she questions why men wage war on each other will stay with you for a long long time.\n",

            "I saw Taj Mahal on opening night here(Nov. 18) at the Naz8 in Lakewood,California.The film had many flaws in the writing and in some of the performances.Akbar Khan did not present it in dynamic, powerful,cinematic terms.He treated it a though he was making an expensive TVserial.But what makes it eminently watchable even as cinema are the two actors who play the lead roles.Sonya Jehan and Zulfikar Sayed have lived up to expectations.Here credit must be given to Akbar Khan who has taken this bold step of introducing new talent in lead roles.But the greatest credit Akbar deserves is for bringing back India'greatest composer the legendary Naushad.His music(both in the songs and the background music) is superb.I intend to see this movie again and again just because of its music.And that is why I have given it a 10.Naushad's earlier hits like Anmol Ghadi, Baiju Bawra, Mother India,Uran Khatola and Mughal-E-Azam(to name just a few) had twelve songs each. I wish Taj Mahal had the same number.If Akbar had done this TajMahal, with all its flaws, would have been the biggest hit of all times.Even now numbers like Ajnabi Thero Zara,Mumtaz Tujhe Dekha and ApniZulfen will carry Taj Mahal far.\n",

            "Pyaar Mein Kabhi Kabhi(Hindi title) or In and Out of Love (The American title) sees Dino Morea and Rinke Khanna starring in this very typical Bollywood masala film about school age kids and their social lives. Unfortunately neither is Shahrukh nor Kajol so it's all just boring and wanna-be like. The songs were okay though (at least for the time) especially the song 'Mussu, Mussu' which is very catchy and has a fun message. The acting by the supporting cast is poor, they all seemed to be aware of the camera at all times and just stood there reading their lines. Even Khanna and Morea seemed uncomfortable with each other at times. I think the main problem is that fact that we've seen this type of story just one time too many. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, song plays after song, trouble ensues, climax and the end.\n",

            "The 1986 Hindi film \"Bhagwaan Dada\" remains significant today, for any number of reasons.The core storyline is compelling: a criminal (the title character, played by Rajnikanth) becomes morally redeemed through his love for a child.This was an early North India film for Rajnikanth, who was already in 1986 the ultimate film action hero of South India.The fight sequences are exciting and entertaining throughout, consistent with the acrobatic action style preferred at the time. The climactic battle of Bhagwaan (Rajnikanth) with his former crimelord 'dada' Shambu (Danny Denzongpa) is simply classic.The story explores how this reformed criminal, ostensibly all alone in the world, gradually builds a 'family' about himself and unites a whole community. A subplot develops a romance between gentle Swaroop (Rakesh Roshan), Bhagwaan's adoptive 'brother', and the brave young woman Bijli (Sridevi) whom Bhagwaan ultimately adopts as his 'sister'.Several charming dance sequences showcase the versatility of Sridevi, and the music by Rajesh Roshan (Rakesh's brother) also delights.Altogether, a complete entertainer.25 years on, however, \"Bhagwaan Dada\"'s most enduring legacy: future Hindi film superstar – Hrithik Roshan – in his only real role as a child actor.As young Govinda, Bhagwaan's adopted son, his role was central to the whole storyline and necessarily entrusted with carrying more of the plot than is usual with child parts. For this film to work it was essential that the audience fully accept Govinda, not just as the motivation for Bhagwaan Dada's reformation, but as the cherished heart of the whole larger community around them. Young Mr Roshan's endearingly mischievous but earnest and good-hearted Govinda completely delivered.Even raw and untutored at 12, the man-who-really-would-be-Emperor – \"Jodhaa Akbar\", 2008 – showed in this early \"Bhagwaan Dada\" fascinating glimpses of things-to-come.There was already a distinctive ease and ... naturalness ... of expression and movement, all the more remarkable in an untrained child. Physically at that time he projected, as preadolescents will, a charmingly 'puppy-ish' quality of waiting to grow into their feet (already, in his case, longer than any of the adults in the film). But there was no awkwardness, somehow. \"Bhagwaan Dada\" required him to share dialogue with some of the biggest stars of the day, dance with first Rajnikanth and later Sridevi, even sing a short song a capella. No problem! Perhaps even more remarkably, this film required the child in this role to fight adult characters. And make it believable. And ... he does. Just freeze-frame his early training sequence on the beach (initial song with Rajnikanth) and you'll see what I mean: the total focus and almost frightening intensity in that young face, an early harbinger of what would later become a trademark in the man's adult work. Hey, this kid even died well! Sorry for the spoiler but yes, Govinda dies in the film. Govinda's brutal murder at the hands, or rather feet, of the evil Shambu Dada is the catalyst that drives the climax of the film, so it was absolutely critical that Govinda's death scene 'work' for the audience. How did young Mr Roshan respond to the challenge? Only deliver what has to be reckoned the best dramatic performance in the whole film – heartwrenching yet completely natural in delivery, in a way that was not at all the style prevailing in Hindi film at the time. Clear foreshadowing of \"things-to-come\" later as an adult.And the face? Even as a preadolescent child with swollen cheeks from cutting teeth, this was so clearly THE face we now know so well as Hrithik Roshan's and Nobody Else that it honestly comes as a shock, when the character opens his mouth to speak for the first time and a little boy's voice comes out.Perhaps the most telling glimpse of this \"things-to-come\" element is apparent in the unguarded reactions of the adult actors to young Hrithik during one take which, probably, they all assumed would be cut from the final edit ... but which, no doubt thanks to an adoring Grandpa behind the camera (Director J. Om Prakash is Hrithik Roshan's maternal grandfather) was retained in the final film.Remember, in 1986 Sridevi and Rajnikanth were already both major superstars. Rakesh Roshan (Hrithik's father, whom he resembles in colouring but thankfully in little else) was himself an established leading man as a Hindi film actor, soon to become an even better director. The fourth adult present was the veteran character actress playing Swaroop's mother. The shot is Govinda dancing across in front of the four adults and singing his little song about his 'uncle' Swaroop's marriage procession and how he, Govinda, will \"dance with joy\". All of which he does. So far, so good. But then Hrithik keeps going. Still singing his little \"dance with joy\" song, he moonwalks backward á là Michael Jackson – (which all the kids were doing those days, as witness 1987's \"Mr India\") – executes a perfect little step turn, and moonwalks back again. He earns, and receives, a gentle swat from Sridevi herself for his efforts. But look at the faces of all four adult actors throughout all this bit: they're absolutely cracking up, every single one of them, Sridevi on down. Real-life daddy Rakesh Roshan gestures to screen daddy Rajnikanth as though to say, \"You see what I have to put up with?\" Delicious! And since the sheer outrageousness of the moment does work, to underscore the charm and playfulness of the Govinda character, the full take was retained.The world of film today is hugely fortunate to enjoy the accomplished adult work of 'That Kid' whose early childhood promise clearly impressed those seasoned actors so many years ago.25 years later, \"Bhagwaan Dada\" still has much to offer anyone interested in the development of the industry, in the craft of performance and acting ... or simply the enjoyment of an entertaining movie well told.\n",

            "Hindi Cinema is passing through an important as well as interesting phase wherein fresh ideas, concepts and innovations are being regularly tried representing the new age thought process of the makers. But most of the times, projects like these fail to make an impact due to three major factors which many would readily agree to, as per their own personal experience.The first being the too-short duration of these films, which is just about 90-100 minutes and second, the costly ticket price charged by the multiplexes exclusively showing these comparatively small films in few selected shows. So even if interested, a large number of viewers avoid such movies due to these two major factors and further the scenario reaches a worst stage when 7 out of 10 such new age ventures turn out to be simply immature, baseless and damaging to their own reputation. However this week's WHAT THE FISH has a reputed name to its credits along with some fine comic actors in the cast too. Yet it cannot be recommended for your weekend plans at all, since it utterly remains a below average attempt made on an interesting subject which could have been something else with a better execution and focus.The film begins on an impressive note reminding you of some recent similar films based in Delhi like FUKREY. But as it progresses it fails to follow any particular comic track and has very few entertaining moments to offer through its all forced comedy till the finale. For instance where in the first half it tries to be an erotic comedy, there in the second it plays some pathetic spoofs on National Boxing Champions namely Vijender and Mary Kom. The characters keep vanishing in between without caring about the continuity factor and director uses two extremely talented actors Manu Rishi and Manjot Singh very carelessly. Moreover, an interval just after 40 minutes puts you off completely and then the lazy screenplay continues post interval too without any focused vision.Actually it doesn't hurt that bad to watch this kind of film if it has all new or some present generation actors trying it too hard. But when a pretty mediocre project like WHAT THE FISH features a veteran actress Dimple Kapadia, screaming like a mad woman on the screen quite forcefully, then it really hurts and makes you forget any of its good points too in totality. Hence though it has a few average performances by Manu Rishi, the girl playing the Saharanpur resident and Manjot Singh (in a cameo), but then their short and undefined roles spoil the overall spirit of the movie based on a thin plot and one doesn't feel like getting the worth of his money and time back walking out of the theater.In short WHAT THE FISH is strictly one of those desperate kind of movies, which you may not mind seeing on the cable channels or on home video in your spare time. But watching it in the theaters spending a lot more on the travel & snacks other than the high priced tickets of the multiplex is certainly not recommended. Further to end it on a progressive note, such small projects are going to survive or find more viewers in the theater in the near future only if they are shown at a special reduced price decided by the exhibitors collectively. So the industry needs to look upon this major factor urgently to keep it going.\n",

            "Amitabh Bachan is a mega star who had a string of memorable movies during his heydays of the mid 70's. That said some of his movies aren't that well known. Imaan Dharam is one of those rare movies of his that I had never seen. Now that I have seen it I know the reason behind it's obscurity and that is that it is a very poorly conceived movie.What was even more shocking was that it was written was Salim Javed, who in the previous year had written the Yash Chopra classic Dewaar and the record breaking Sholay. The main problem is that there are two many distractions and characters that deviate from the main plot, such as Helen hiring Amitabh's character to pose as the father to her daughter amongst others.The writers made some bad decisions with the writing, like when Shetty reveals Sanjeev Kumar;s innocence two hours into the movie and as a result he is subsequently released from jail and Prem Chopra and company are exposed. If I were the writer I would have kept him in jail until the last scene adding to the dramatic impact. Salim's Javed's scripts are known for their great emotional moments, who can forget Jai's death at the end of Sholay. Sadly Helen's death doesn't have any impact whatsoever. The reason being that we saw too little of her considering she was the female lead opposite Amitabh. Amitabh and Shashi didn't make much of an impact, Rekha was grossly underused as the movie gave more precedence to the stunning Aparna Sen. Sanjeev Kumar on the other hand shines as the do gooder who sets the two leads on the path of righteousness. The songs aren't that particularly memorable either. What Imaan Dharam does have is a wide assortment of villain actors like Prem Chopra, Amrish Puri, Sudhir, Shetty (father of Rohit Shetty no less) and Mac Mohan.Overall I expected much more from the talent involved\n",

            "Raju Mavani's Balwaan was a launchpad for Sunil Shetty who had already acted in one shelved film, Ek Aur Faulad. When Pahlaj Nihalani's Ek Aur Faulad was canned, Sunil had not lose hope completely because his Balwaan was being filmed. This typical action film was panned by critics but the masses loved it. Balwaan's success was Sunil's victorious entry into the Indian Film Industry.The film has an age old story which has been narrated ample amount of times. It has a man who cannot stand any form of injustice. This protagonist has been brutalizing all those who torment and harass innocents ever since he was a child. The hero has a widowed mother and a young sister who will fall into trouble after our hero is wrongly imprisoned. The first chunk of this humdrum consists of several college scenes which are supposed to be light moments. Most of these are monotonous barring a few funny lines. The romance is sweet but jarring and it takes some time for the real plot to kick in. The real fun arises when the villain and his nefarious activities are introduced. The film is good until the part when Sunil's loved ones are eradicated. The drag continues with Sunil's failed escape, torture, and successful escape from prison. What follows are a bunch of action sequences which entertain.The director,Deepak Anand, has attempted to recycle the same old done to death formula used excessively in the 1980s. He does handle some scenes well but some scenes are too overdone. For instance, Tinnu Annand's character did not need to lose his arms. That brutality was unnecessary and preposterous. The very last scene in which Sunil hastily dodges the bullets fired by Danny to kill him is pretty overdone. Another problem is some pointless songs which just lengthen the film. However, the film has one bearable romantic track crooned by Kumar Sanu-Kya Cheez Hai Mohabbat Ye. The action scenes are mostly decent but the climax is slightly overdone.Sunil Shetty was incredibly raw in his first lead role as the mainstream action hero. He was effective in the action scenes but he lacked the spark in several scenes. Whenever he has to shout, he messes up due to the overdone hamming. Initially, Sunil was not that good at emoting as well. Nevertheless, a successful debut. The late Divya Bharti was decent in a blink and miss role. She was not given much scope in this heavy duty action film. Danny Denzongpa is awesome as the typical unsympathetic villain. His dialogues were good and his expressions were truly effective. Tinnu Anand is good as the supportive cop but his character is violently subdued which definitely irritates. Vikram Gokhale's character is shown as a corrupt cop but his sudden change of mind before his death is weird. Arun Bakshi is annoying as the negative jailer who enjoys torturing Sunil Shetty in prison. The rest provide decent support.On the whole, Balwaan is an average film which heavily relies on it's action sequences. It was Sunil's successful debut which got him noticed by some other directors. Thankfully, Sunil improved his dialogue delivery and expressions eventually.\n",

            "You can't watch all the movies for inspiration or message. A lot many of them are to be watched for pure entertainment only and then this underhyped and less promoted one is for those only who want neat and clean wholesome entertainment consisting of an ideal family in which Bhaiya and Bhabhi are no less than parents for the younger brother, a lovely romance, a love triangle that come into existence due to an obsessive second female lead, a struggler but talented singer's success in the competitive world of Mumbai and finally the action and the thrill in similar optimum quantum as salt in Daal or Sabzi or Aata.The extra-ordinarily handsome and dashing hero Nakul Kapur is a villager in his debut (and unfortunately the last also) movie, living in Jaisalmer with his loving Bhaiya and Bhabhi and always dreams of making it big in the music world, courtesy his god-given singing talent. A tourist - Aarti Chhabaria arrives his city with her college group and identifies the diamond hidden in dust just like an able Jauhari. She advises him to come to Mumbai. And when getting his Bhaiya-Bhabhi convinced with difficulty, he moves from Jaisalmer to Mumbai, he gets shelter in the house of his motivator, Aarti living with her widow mother and younger sisters (a mother of grown-up daughter has no hitch in allowing a largely unknown male to live with them, great filmy mother !) but the harsh realities of the career and market frustrate him. He is not ready to let go the virtues developed in him during his village life but not ready to give up as well. And then arrives the spoiled rich butterfly - Kim Sharma who hears his voice in a road show (it was his last resort to make the people hear his voice and see his talent) and falls for him. With her support, Nakul really makes it big in the Bollywood music world but Kim's obsession for him creates a love triangle of Nakul, Aarti and Kim, ultimately leading to a violent climax, sending Kim to wheelchair. But Nakul is still grateful to her for everything done by her to build his career.The highly melodious music of this movie composed by Nadeem Shravan has made this movie comparable to Saawan Ko Aane Do (the musical hit of Rajshri in 1979) but that similarity is for the 50%part of the movie, the balance 50% has its take on Ram Gopal Verma's Pyar Tune Kya Kiya. But this cocktail is not bad, it's rather good and gives you a satisfactory feel. All the formulae have been mixed in the right proportions in the movie and you know when all the required ingredients masaalas) are properly mixed (nothing much, nothing less), the dish is bound to be delicious. That's the case with Tumse Achchha Kaun Hai. The entertainment provided does not allow the viewer to pay attention to the directorial mistakes or the cinematic liberties taken to lead the movie towards a reasonable end of the story. Engrossing. Definitely.Music as I have already admired is TAKH's biggest strength. At least five of the total seven compositions are highly melodious as well as meaningful and able to touch the chord of the listener's heart. The next strength is performances. The protagonist, Nakul Kapur has given an amazing performance and in my view, he was the deserving claimant of the best debut award for the year 2002. He has showed his talent and guts in action, dance, emotion, romance; where not ! But surprisingly tragic fact is that he just disappeared from the silver screen after this praiseworthy debut. That's how the cruel world functions. Aarti Chhabaria and Kim Sharma though, are still acting in odd movies and at least they cannot be called unemployed. Most of the characters have done well (some underplayed, some exaggerated but overall impact has been satisfactory for the story that has come before the spectators). Aarti Chhabaria, first time in a lead role, looks pretty though shown fully clad in traditional Indian clothes, just like the girl next door (behenji type). It proves that to look beautiful, a girl does not essentially have to be glamorous. Kim Sharma could not repeat the Urmila Matondkar act of Pyar Tune Kya Kiya but she has worked hard to deliver a convincing performance. Finally, Raghuveer Yadav, a highly talented actor coming from the stream of realistic cinema, has delivered a knock-out performance that stands out among others. The cinematographer has admirably captured the beauty of Rajasthan in the first half of the movie. Dialogues are also good. Editing is OK.My advice to the viewers - just watch the movie with moderate expectation and be clear in your mind that you are watching it for wholesome entertainment and not for any other objective. Then, you take my word for it, you will love it. It was a box office flop, perhaps because of bad publicity and new unknown faces in the leads. But it is worth a dekko.Personally asking, I would like to watch it again and again. The personality of Nakul Kapur in the movie is such that I would not have been surprised had I found several young unmarried girls of our country falling for him (as was the trend for Rajesh Khanna in the late sixties and early seventies). Had the movie been given better publicity and become a box office success, who knows Nakul would have become the next heartthrob of the young Indian females. But that's called destiny.Nice timepass.\n",

            "Pyar Kiye Jaa is essentially like Kishore Kumar. His madness, eccentricity is all captured very well! Adding to the mayhem, Shashi Kapoor, Mehmood and Om Prakash make this a very enjoyable movie.The story synopsis: Shashi Kapoor gets a job in a firm owned by Om Prakash (Ramlal). For some inane reason, Shashi gets fired soon. His next Plan of Action - Protest! He camps outside Ramlal's bungalow..which makes way to introduce Ramlal's two daughters..Shashi likes one..over some hurled buckets of water!Next POA! After some hate at first sight..wooing..etc..the couple in love need to have Shashi's parents come over to meet Ramlal..Kishore Kumar, Shashi's bum chum is summoned as a uncle/dad...Problem is Kishore likes Ramlal's other daughter..so the impersonation cannot be held long!But the piece de resistance in this movie is Mehmood, the aspiring film director..In one situation, he is convincing dad Ramlal about a great murder mystery/plot..which is complete with his sound effects..door creaking..wind blowing...must be among the funniest scenes in Hindi cinema! There is also nubile Mumtaz, aspiring actress and her words of wisdom..ha ha..Some decent music..and funny performances with fairly engaging plot make it an ideal Sunday watch! Laugh away!\n",

            "Kabzaa is a Bollywood movie from the 1980s, so don't expect subtlety, carefully elaborated characters, ambitious plots, interesting subplots, or highly consistent storytelling. But then, who said we can't enjoy a movie with a simple, straightforward story, cardboard heroes and a villain who is really BAD, if the actors manage to entertain? The movie begins with a young Sanjay Dutt (still known as \"Sunjay\" in those days) covered with blood, with four bullets in his chest and one in his head, trying to save himself. The rest of the movie lives up to the expectations raised by its catchy prelude.Ravi (Sanjay Dutt) and Ranjit (Raj Babbar) are brothers. Ravi is a good-for-nothing without a job and without a purpose in life, Ranjit is a successful lawyer who works for the local don, Velji Bhai (Paresh Rawal). Velji Bhai wants to purchase a piece of land owned by Ustad Ali Mohammed (Alok Nath) at any cost, but the latter intends to use it for building a children's park instead, and thus refuses. When Ravi is sent out by Velji Bhai to persuade Ali Mohammed with violence, he is so impressed by the man's kindheartedness that he starts protecting him instead. Velji Bhai, of course, is furious...The story is very similar to that of another movie, Ghulam, made ten years later by Mahesh Bhatt's nephew Vikram Bhatt. Both movies are based on (let's avoid the word \"remake\") Marlon Brando's all-time classic \"On the Waterfront\". Whatever one may think of Bollywood-style remakes, it means at least that we can't complain about a bad story. And indeed, unlike many other Bollywood movies from the same period, Kabzaa is a movie one can watch without ever getting bored: the tempo is decent, drama and action sequences follow each other quickly enough to keep one's thoughts from drifting away. Fortunately, Bhatt refrained from inserting obnoxious comedy elements, and the obligatory love stories are kept to a minimum. Still, it is the actors that make this movie worth watching. Sanjay Dutt, Raj Babbar, Paresh Rawal and Alok Nath all give fine performances. The two female roles, played by Amrita Singh and Dimple Kapadia, add little of value, but at least they don't spoil the movie, which is already an achievement in itself.\n",

            "Legendary filmmaker Shyam Benegal's 'The Making of the Mahatma' portrays the younger years of Gandhi (as the title suggests). Through a compelling narrative, Benegal tells the story of Gandhi's attempts in bringing justice to Indians in South Africa. The film has a certain rawness that makes the situation, setting and people look more real. Gandhi and his wife are portrayed as a humans (rather than a saints) which is especially evident in the scenes that display the marital conflict. Unlike in Feroze Khan's 2007 film 'Gandhi My Father' where Gandhi's wife is portrayed as the ideal wife, here she is portrayed as someone who has very much struggled with her husband's devotion to the people. Rajit Kapoor gives a very sincere performance in the title role and his nuances seem to be spot on. Overall, He does a commendable job. Pallavi Joshi too makes a strong presence and delivers an admirable performance. The supporting cast is adequate but the extras are merely mechanical. Benegal makes a decent effort to avoid Indian stereotypes where the 'whites' are often seen as the bad guys. He makes a good balance in distinguishing the good from the bad without giving in to stereotype. Yet, some of the 'villain' do come across as caricatures. At some point, the pace also drags. There are a few scenes that were extremely disturbing e.g. when the warden pours the toilet water over the wounded businessman. In a nutshell, 'The Making of the Mahatma' tells the compelling story of Gandhi's journey from a young lawyer to the symbol of a nation...a journey that had its costs and demanded sacrifice.\n",

            "'Apna Asmaan' tries to deal with an interesting concept but turns out to be a big mess due to the uneven screenplay which emerges as somewhat pretentious and uninteresting. However, I would like to give credit to director Kaushik for choosing an interesting subject and making the film somewhat watchable. It does have some good moments and two very talented actors: Irfan Khan and Shobana.However, this is far from Irfan's best work and yet he does well with his role but it's not as good as what he did in 'Deadline Sirf 24 Ghante'. Shobana is impressive and an actress like her deserves more. Dhruv really has a problem with delivering his lines and his loud at times. Rajat Kapoor is wasted.The film starts off interestingly as it deals with the parents' struggle with their autistic son. Then at the interval portion, it takes a turn when the father injects the 'Brain Booster' into the son and things change. There's hardly any explanation for the drastic change in his behaviour. The doctor (Rajat Kapoor) later suspects that his limbic brain must be damaged but there's hardly a brain scan done on Buddhi to confirm anything. Also, quite conveniently the 'evil' doctor is easily found. Why is it a wrong thing to have your child go to a 'special' school where these children are taught skills and guidance to live? One can understand why parents are embarrassed but there is no need to be. All this issues are brought up but either dealt with in a half-baked manner or not at all. Oh there are just too many flaws in the story....The film would have worked if it stayed with the initial focus which was the family's struggle with autism. It could have been carried out as a means to somewhat educate and to deal with the disorder and tell a compelling story. But now it is dealt with only in a superficial way. 'Apna Asmaan' tries to convey that it is more important to be a good human being than among the most intelligent of mankind but the storytelling is just poor and it somewhat gives a misguided message regarding autism (a misunderstood disorder in India).\n",

A love story and family wrangles are interspersed with the political/social commentary as are some singing and dancing interludes, making this film a little hard to classify. What starts of in typical Bollywood fashion as a light romantic comedy, then plunges into some extremely disturbing footage of atrocities and then manages to shift again into a retro village drama scenario.\n",

It may have been relevant movie when it was made.What stands out though is a simple narrative, and excellent performances by Shashi Kapoor, Sharmila Tagore, Om Puri and Kulbhooshan Kharbanda. It is also one of the few movies made in India that looks at the difficulty and paradox inherent in a crime-journalist's profession. It is hard to maintain objectivity while covering a story and not feel empathy towards those suffering at the same time. The journalist played by Shashi Kapoor faces this dilemma while trying to uncover a dubious racket involving politics, riots and murder, and in the end decides to stick to what he thinks is right.\n",

            "In bollywood movies, there always have been certain set formulae used in most of the movies to entertain the target audience. The audience is served what it likes. However the intelligent filmmaker is one who knows the right proportion of the formulae to be used in presenting the chosen story on celluloid. When (deliberately or by default) it happens, the audience find the movie as highly entertaining.Jhuk Gaya Aasmaan (1968) is one such movie. The writers, Prayag Raj and Omkar Sahib in unison with the director, Lekh Tandon have presented a formula-based movie in which the proportion of all the formulae used are just perfect. The result is a thoroughly engrossing movie which entertains the viewers from the very first frame to the very last frame. It contains most of the usual bollywood formulae - romance, comedy, emotion, re-incarnation, action, melodious music and finally a murder. But everything neither exceeds nor falls short of the optimum quantum required to entertain the (Indian) public.The story revolves around our hero Sanjay (Rajender Kumar) who is a tourist guide in Darjeeling and lives a happy-go-lucky life with his friend Hanuman (Rajendra Nath) comes across our heroine Priya (Saira Banu) who has arrived from Calcutta with her college group. Quite expectedly, they fall in love with each other. But after Priya is back to the city because of the news of her father's arrest, Sanjay dies in a mishap. Now when his soul reaches Yamraaj (the Death God in the Hindu mythology), it is known that the Yamdoot sent to bring the soul of his double Tarun Kumar Saxena, has erroneously brought him because of the sameness of faces of these two. Sanjay requests Yamraaj to send him back into his body but now it is not possible because his funeral has already taken place. So, as the last resort available to him, Yamraaj infuses Sanjay's soul into the dead body of Tarun Kumar aka TK who was been a corrupt man in his life, doing all types of bad things in the company of Prem Kumar (Prem Chopra) who had created a rift between him and his grandmother (Durga Khote).Now Sanjay in the body of TK, is close to his sweetheart Priya because his new home is also in Calcutta where Priya lives with his father who earlier worked for TK (and had got arrested by him only) and well-acquainted with his grandma too. However he, originally being an honest and noble person, is very uncomfortable because of the tainted past of his new body. He now starts correcting the wrongdoings of TK, patches up with his resented grandma and keeps distance from Prem. Prem, not being aware of the truth that it is Sanjay in the body of TK, makes his own moves on the chessboard of business, power and glamour and finally masterminds a murder to frame TK. Finally the movie reaches its happy ending with the baddie being arrested and the lovers being united.This story has been borrowed from a Hollywood movie of 1941 - Here Comes Mr. Jordan which had been remade as Heaven Can Wait (1978). However the writers and the director have given the movie an Indian look and as I have already praised them, mixed all the bollywood formulae in the perfect ratio in the basic story plot and prepared a spicy dish for the Indian audience. The movie does not bore you even for the fraction of a second and you get your money's worth in full. While watching the spicy, formula-based movies of Farah Khan (Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om), I was wondering whether she has learnt from this movie as to how to make a masala movie for the Indians.The performances are all up to the mark. This is one more silver jubilee movie of the romantic hero Rajender Kumar who was known as Jubilee Kumar in the sixties. His on screen chemistry with Saira Banu who herself was known as the beauty-queen in that period, is amazing. Her sex appeal in the song - Unse Mili Nazar Ki Mere Hosh Udd Gaye is so great that no Kareena Kapoor or Katrina Kaif is a match for her. Rajender Nath's comedy is hilarious. Prem Chopra as the villain, Durga Khote as the affectionate grandma, Parveen Choudhary as TK's secretary cum girlfriend among others are quite all right.Shankar-Jaikishan has composed highly melodious songs for the movie. Kaun Hai Jo Sapno Mein Aaya, Unse Mili Nazar Ki Mere Hosh Udd Gaye, Kahaan Chal Diye Idhar To Aao, Kisi Ki Jaan Lete Hain, Mere Tumhaare Beech Mein, Meri Ankhiyon Ki Nindiya, Sachcha Hai Pyar etc. all are very very good to listen. Most of the songs are among the extremely popular songs of Lata and Rafi. The music of this movie is, in fact, a very big treat for the melody lovers.Technically also, the movie is perfect. The cinematographer has captured the beauty of Darjeeling very well. The prints of this movie are so good even today (after 42 years) that the brightness of colours cools your eyes. Art direction, editing, production value and all other aspects are quite in order.Summing up, you will get a satisfactory feeling after this movie similar to the one you get after consuming a delicious, spicy dish. I was fortunate enough to watch it on the big screen but it is enjoyable on the small screen as well.\n",

            "I have read on the beginning page of a novel (paperback edition) of a novel of legendary Bangla author Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay - 'Pooja Ke Phool Jitne Pavitra Hote Hain Us-se Bhi Zyaada Pavitra Hain Sarat Babu Ke Upanyaas' (Sarat Babu's novels are even more sacrosanct than the flowers used in God's worship). After reading a number of novels penned by this legend during the first few decades of the twentieth century, I can safely endorse this statement. Reading his novels renders a pious effect to the heart and the soul of the reader.One such novel is Nishkriti which is a touching family drama full of emotions, love and family bonds. It was adapted by the director Basu Chatterjee for the Hindi movie Apne Paraaye (1980). It's a movie which can be seen by the whole Indian family together without any hitch as this emotional and lovely family drama is sans all kinds of vulgarity and shallowness. The plot itself is great. And the efficient and interesting treatment, supported by excellent performances and melodious as well as meaningful songs makes it a memorable social movie. Doing justice to a classic literary work is not an easy job but director Basu Chatterjee has done it with finesse.The story belongs to a highly successful and well-off lawyer Utpal Dutt who loves his younger cousin, Amol Palekar very much. His wife, Ashalata treats Amol's wife Shabana Aazmi no less than her younger sister. The children in the family are also living as real siblings instead of cousins. The only thing is that Amol does not take much interest in earning and is happy being dependent on his elder brother. Things change when Utpal's real brother, Girish Karnad comes to live with him alongwith his wife, Bharti Acharekar and son. Now this greedy and manipulative couple starts creating rifts in the family and turning the environment against Amol and Shabana. Finally Amol and Shabana leave Utpal's home and shift to the village. However Girish sues them in the name of Utpal under false charges. Utpal remains ignorant of the things for a long time but when he becomes aware of it, he takes such a step which is no less than a slap on the face of the conspirating Girish and Bharti. The family gets reunited with the return of Amol and Shabana.This story is full of touching and loving moments. The readers will agree that when there is love in hearts, even the anger shown is more ostentatious than real. This has been made clear through Ashalata's anger towards her sister-in-law Shabana who is more educated, mature and sensible in comparison to her and practically runs the house despite her husband contributing nothing to the family income. The love shown among the children is also heart-conquering. When Amol and Shabana leave the home with their children, Ashalata's emotions are simply tear-jerking. The movie contains several scenes which underscore the importance of family bonds and win the viewers' hearts.The drama is utterly interesting right from the very start to the very finish. There is not a single boring scene. There is no dearth of laughs in the movie, generated through the forgetful nature of Utpal Dutt. The only thing is that the performances of certain characters including that of Bharti Acharekar are over the top. Besides, a highly successful lawyer, i.e., Utpal Dutt having a forgetful nature, is also not convincing. However these flaws do not draw the attention of the audience.The performances are perfect. However Utpal Dutt is the show-stealer. Personally I consider the performance of debutant Ashalata as highly admirable. All, including the child artists, have done quite well. It's a simple movie with a simple backdrop. The technical aspects are in accordance with this fact and perfectly in order.Melodious and meaningful songs are another highlight of this movie. Surprisingly Bappi Lahiri has given music to the lyrics of Yogesh. Most of the songs have been sung by Yesudas and Lata Mangeshkar. Shyam Rang Ranga Re, Gaao Mere Mann and Halke Halke Aayi Chalke are real gems, declaring the greatness of the Indian music. After listening to these songs based on Indian classical Raagas, it's hard to believe that these have been composed by Bappi Lahiri.I recommend this excellent movie to all who are interested in watching good movies made on literary works as well as those who like neat and clean, no-nonsense family dramas.\n",

            "Jab Dard Nahin Tha Seene Mein, Tab Khaak Maza Tha Jeene Mein (When there was no feeling of pain in my heart, what the hell was the pleasure of living). Sounds impractical ? It is. Surprisingly it is very much practical for the true artists whose art gets refined only through the pain in their hearts. Today I am reviewing Anurodh (1977) starring Rajesh Khanna, Vinod Mehra and Simple Kapadia whose music, among many others, contains a tear-jerking song consisting of the same words. It comes in the climax of the movie and makes the audience shed tears.Anurodh (request) is the story of Arun (Rajesh Khanna), the son of a rich businessman, Mr. Chaudhary (Utpal Dutt). He is passionate about music which is strongly disliked by his father. Hence he adopts a pseudo-name for his artistic life - Sanjay. However his father kicks him out of his home and he moves to the house of his motor-mechanic friend - Bhisham Singh (Asrani) and his wife (Preeti Ganguly). Now he happens to meet the love of his life too - Sunita (Simple Kapadia), the grand-daughter of Mr. Mathur (Ashok Kumar). He changes his name once again to Preetam Nath Ghayal and gets the job of a chauffeur in the house of his sweetheart.On one track, this rom-com runs to delight the audience, on the other, runs the pain-soaked story of Arun's another friend - Shrikant (Vinod Mehra) who is a poet and lives with his widow mother (Nirupa Roy) under extreme poverty. At their hearts, himself and Arun are no less than real brothers. He authors lyrics for the songs of Arun. He has been caught by tuberculosis but he hides his disease from his mother as well as Arun. Though Arun never appears on the stage for a live show (he sings on radio only), he has to change his decision to arrange a huge sum for the operation of his beloved friend Shrikant whose decease he comes to know of quite late. It is then the song mentioned in the title and the first para of this review, comes before the audience. The movie ends on a happy note.Anurodh (1977) is another gem from Shakti Samanta-Rajesh Khanna team who had given many memorable movies prior to this. Anurodh is a bit different from others in the sense that it contains a heavy dose of sentiments. Despite comedy and romance getting sufficient footage in the movie, the main theme remains sentimental only. And the seasoned director has handled the script brilliantly. Not only the movie is utterly interesting but also the emotion embedded in the theme alights deep into the heart of the viewer. There are several scenes in the movie (linked to Shrikant, his poverty and his illness) which move the watcher like anything. TB (tuberculosis) became curable a few years later to the release of this movie but in that period, it was considered a deadly disease. The scene of Shrikant's stopping himself from committing suicide upon listening to the optimistic song authored by none other than himself only, is just superb. Another heart-conquering scene is the interaction of Shrikant with the publisher of his poems for his due amount.And Vinod Mehra's outstanding performance is the heart and soul of the emotional drama presented on the screen. I consider Vinod Mehra a highly underrated actor who never got his due from Bollywood. His performance in Anurodh is an unforgettable one. The ailing, full of self-respect, yet suffering from guilt-complex to create troubles for his beloved ones, poet Shrikant who pens poems of hope and optimism but forced by the misery prevailing in his life to decide to kill himself has been enlivened by Vinod Mehra on the screen.Rajesh Khanna was past his heyday when Anurodh was released. However his performance is definitely first rate. Especially his outburst before Shrikant when he comes to know that Shrikant has been suffering from TB and may not live beyond a few days, is able to leave indelible imprint upon the viewer's heart. Ditto about his performance in the climax when he appears in person before the music lovers for the first time in his life and appeals to them to pray for Shrikant's life.This is the debut movie of Dimple Kapadia's younger sister, (late) Simple Kapadia (Rajesh Khanna's real life sister-in-law) and she is just okay. The complete supporting cast has done exceedingly well to complement the performance of the lead characters (Arun and Shrikant).Laxmikant Pyarelal have composed outstanding music for this movie. On one hand, there are romantic songs like - Aate Jaate Khoobsurat Aawaara Sadkon Par, Aapke Anurodh Pe Main Ye Geet Sunaata Hoon and Mere Dil Ne Tadap Ke Jab Naam Tera Pukaara, on the other is the sentimental song - Jab Dard Nahin Tha Seene Mein. Kishore Kumar is at his very best in the songs of this movie. It contains the inspiring song - Tum Besahaara Ho To Kisi Ka Sahaara Bano also which is an underrated gem of Manna Dey. Anand Bakshi has penned the touching lyrics of the songs.Technical and production value aspects are quite in line with the reputation of the banner of Shakti Samanta. Considering the simple characters and the simple set up required for the script, the director has demonstrated his better judgment by avoiding undue pump and show.Anurodh is a movie both for the classes and the masses. It's thoroughly entertaining with sufficient laughters and musical romance for the regular movie buffs. At the same time, it is a memorable experience for the movie viewers liking sentimental stuff.\n",

The movie has so much to offer: 1) Multiple layers: It is not just the characters but even the movie itself which has so many layers to it. As the movie moves from one scene to another you can relate to a scene half an hour back. You connect the threads to understand the circumstances than and how it led to the characters behaving the way they did. Most such movies generally do this for you near the movie end, but Pestonjee respects it's viewer's intelligence and leaves it up to viewers to fathom the events. When you watch this movie, always try to link each scene to some sequence in the past and you will come to appreciate the movie tremendously. 2) Brilliant Acting: With an awesome star cast of Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Anupam Kher and Kiron Kher you kind of expect it. But this is one of their finest. Especially Naseeruddin Shah with his Parsi punches. What amazed me the most was how subtle changes in movie emotions are not conveyed through dialogue or events, but rather through Naseeruddin Shah's facial and bodily expressions. He plays a very quiet, introvert character but carries the entire movie on his shoulders. The movie might appear to move very slowly as the surroundings and the dialogues maintain the same tone throughout, but one needs to read between the lines and characters to really gauge how quickly the movie moves. 3) Emotions: Pestonjee contains all the emotions that you could think of. Comedy, tragedy, friendship, love, trust, betrayal, sacrifice, greed, satisfaction and lot more. 4) A Message: The movie has so many messages to convey. But the most central one is conveyed in movie's last line. The inherent human weakness of complaining about or comparing lives rather than trying to enjoy what we have. It couldn't have been portrayed better.I am a big Naseeruddin Shah fan and try to watch all his movies. But just hats off to Pirojsha. From amongst all his movies that I have seen, this for me is his finest performance ever and by some distance as well. Just a shame that such a combination of acting, direction and story can't be found in current generation of movies. This movie is a must watch!\n",

            "3.5/10??? This title is preposterously over-rated. Yes, you read it right, over-rated. Plot:- This title is about a hideous looking closeted and married man (Yuvraj Parasher) falling in love with another hideous looking effeminate dodo (Kapil Sharma, Bollywood director Anil Sharma's younger brother), who, I suppose is out (to whomsoever it may concern). They go to Goa (Gay Paradise of India) and make some nude gay love in a hotel room. (Yup, that is what all the gay couples - closeted or out, do in India; they all go to Goa to hump each other. Because in Goa, barring the Russian Govt., no one really cares. Not even the Indian Govt.) What the viewers get to see, after the clothes come undone, is an increased degree of hideousness. Yuvraj Parasher's nude buttock shot and our Dodo's stocky torso (passed off as biceps and triceps) in this movie possesses the power of converting any gay man to straight man. I did not really care to watch this title (free of cost on YouTube) beyond fifteen minutes of its run-time for the sole reason, that I feared, that I may forget my English grammar, sentence construction and pronunciation, that I learned in school and over the years.The title, when it came out (no pun intended), was hyped as India's answer to \"Brokeback Mountain\". One word - R.O.F.L. Whoever made such tall claims, for sure, was out of his/ her mind, or someone from the PR team, or someone who haven't seen \"Brokeback Mountain\", or someone who has got absolutely nothing to do with writing and making movies and who is spoon-fed to utter crap or someone who is fresh out of an asylum and given a job (out of compassion and humanity) to write about movies.The movie was real hot amongst the gay community in India when its release was due. But the hotness was washed off beneath the shower and beneath the jet spray in the privacy of bathrooms and loos. Because every gay guy in India is happily married with children and a lovely wife. (If U.K got Oxford, India has got Orthodox. Beat that.) So, no one, barring a few gay activists in Bombay, whose lives revolves around behaving effeminately all the time (under the pretense of activism for equal rights and liberation of gay community in India) and embarrassing everyone around, went to see this in theaters. Result - as expected, the movie bombed more seriously than the ones at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This movie, though, do have a few electrifying shock values - Firstly, singer Lata Mangeshkar, who is equated to the Hindu Goddess Saraswati revered for Knowledge, Music, Arts, Wisdom and Learning, croons the outright rubbish title track in English language. Mangeshkar sang a rendition of Anne Murray's \"You Needed Me\", live in concert in 1985 in Canada. This was a special request from the Grammy winner herself. Mangeshkar carried it off with aplomb and rendered beautifully. She has dabbled impeccably and soulfully in various languages, but English is surely not one of them. I believe that her rendition of \"You Needed Me\" gave her a wrong impression that she can sing in English as well. You have to listen to the rubbish title track of this movie to believe your eyes. Here, Lata Mangeshkar crooning in English about the pain and anguish of the gay community in India is like George Bush talking about world peace at the UN in Kurdish. I will say - C'mon old timer, just retire; retire with grace and when at \"top\" (No pun intended. Mangeshkar is female) of your game. Do not make yourself into a laughing stock. Go home and make Mutton Stock. I've read you are a fabulous cook and love gorging on Mutton. Second shock comes in the form of casting - Kabir Bedi, who acted alongside Roger Moore in 1983's \"Octopussy\" and a few other international productions, here, mouths lines that sound picked off from school text-books and passed off as dialogues. The presence of other critically acclaimed or revered actors in Bollywood - like Zeenat Aman, Helen and Rituporno Sengupta, only affirms the fact that they have all gone broke, if not bonkers, and did this atrocity passed off as India's answer to \"Brokeback Mountain\" just for money. The only \"Pie for my Eye\" apple in this \"piece of work\" is the salivating enough to give an instant hard on, hunk with the athletic physic and the devil from divinity is Maradona Rebello. But no need to go through this torture passed off as India's answer to \"Brokeback Mountain\" just for Mr. Rebello. In today's time, you can get ample of his clips from this garbage and his other works on the internet. Or simple, just google him. All in all, if you want to see a movie \"coming out\" (pun intended here) from India about homosexuality, then go for director Onir's \"My Brother, Nikhil\", released in 2005 and featuring Sanjay Suri and Purab Kohli as the gay lovers for life; with supporting cast of Juhi Chawla, Victor Banerjee, Lilette Dubey, Dia Mirza and film director Sujoy Ghosh (Jhankar Beats, Kahaani). A decade since its initial release in India, there have been no other film about homosexuality made that had a true depiction of the taboo subject. Not even Onir's own recent release - \"I Am, Omar\" could come close to \"My Brother, Nikhil.\" One can only wish, gay relationships in India were like the one depicted in \"My Brother, Nikhil\", being true and faithful to each other all life.Unfortunately, it is everything like the garbage depicted in \"Dunno Y\" - sex craving closeted Muscle Marrys' hunting each other and then humping each other. Love ceases to exist anymore.\n",

            "Once again a Hindi horror film releases and a decent number of people are there in the theater in its first show itself, proving the huge pull of this particular genre among the audience. But sadly repeating the same old rotten story, this time too we are again served with an all seen before content offering nothing new, either in the plot or the form, without caring about what the viewers actually expect from a horror film precisely. And that is the reason why a foreign horror flick gets a wide release in India, serves the purpose well and earns some quick money easily, but the same is not the case with our own Hindi horror films made within the country.So frankly there is nothing much to review in this week's MACHHLI JAL KI RANI HAI releasing on Friday the 13th. Since as usual the film wastes a good 40-45 minutes in the silent buildup alone and then comes with the same routine, tried and tested formulas having no novel twist in the second half. The poor songs keep interrupting the narration at times and following the set pattern the director puts in a sensual scene too as 'a must have' in a Hind horror film since ages. Without any fresh angle incorporated in the script, the film fails to impress the viewers completely featuring the same old elements of a haunted house with an ugly history, a savior coming in and then a series of murders around the premises leading to climax full of CGI effects.In short the only thing which works in the film is Swara Bhaskar, sincerely trying too hard to portray her given role as a thorough professional, though her make-up and costumes could have been much better. A few brutal, bloody sequences do provide the (much awaited) timely shocks in its concluding hour but nothing else catches your attention in the film as it should, be it cinematography, sound effects, background score or the avoidable poor soundtrack, to be straight. In the rest of the cast, Bhanu Uday keeps trying it over the top and only Saurabh Dubey performs well whereas Murali Sharma is just there to show his face in only 2-3 scenes.To end on a positive note, no doubt director Debaloy Dey proves his creative ability to handle a horror project well. But I seriously wish his writers could think of a novel plot to base the film on, as the westerners try to do in most of their new horror flicks having some kind of USP to win over the viewers. So with a hope that the team might come up with a better horror flick next time, you can easily wait for its DVD release or a channel telecast soon in the coming months.\n",

            "'Dhool Ka Phool', Yash Chopra's amazing directorial debut is a classic of classics. The film is about the social norms of those times, showing their effect on people of that time. This is the story of Meena (Mala Sinha), a young and orphaned woman who lives with her aunt and uncle. Meena meets Mahesh, and the two fall in love. However, when she finds out that she is pregnant, Mahesh leaves the city and the next time she meets him is on his wedding with a rich girl in the big city. Meena is thrown out of her uncle's house and upon giving birth to a baby boy, her despair and Mahesh's further rejection cause her to abandon him in a dark forest. When she comes back to senses and runs to take him back, she is too late: the baby was already collected by an old and kind Muslim named Abdul. Abdul decides to adopt the kid, much to the charging of the Hindu/Muslim communities. He re-locates to the city, but is unable to shake the stigma of bringing up an illegitimate child, Roshan. Meanwhile, Meena has got married to a lawyer, but her son Roshan is often subjected to all kinds of taunts by fellow classmates. He has only one friend, and it is Ramesh, who happens to be none other than his biological father Mahesh's son.A powerful and poignant picture, 'Dhool Ka Phool' shows how destructive social prejudice can be, mainly through the characters of Meena and Roshan. The fear Meena feels when she discovers she is going to be a single mother, the insults Roshan has to bear every time he goes to school - all show that something is very wrong with our society. I still remember the scene when Meena comes to reproach Mahesh with the baby in her hands and threatens to scream that it is his son for all to know, and he replies that she has no way to prove that and that she can throw him as far as he is concerned. That's what prompts her to do something that will torment her for the rest of her life. When Abdul Rashid takes the kid, he gets excommunicated by the people because the boy's religion remains unclear. In one wonderful scene, he sharply criticises them for their double-standards and leaves the neighbourhood. The stories of Roshan and Meena get intertwined in the form of a court case in which the boy is accused of a theft for no fault of his own, and the judge is none other than Mahesh.The film is brilliantly written, narrated and acted, and is done realistically with almost no exaggerated dramatisation. It starts as a romance and then turns into a moving drama. Mukhram Sharma's dialogues are exceptional and Narayan Datta's music is wonderfully composed with fantastic lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi. One great song that remains relevant even today is \"Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalmaan Banega\", which is pictured on the Abdul Rashid character when he decides to take the boy despite his neighbours' opposition, meaning \"You will grow up to be neither Hindu nor Muslim; you will grow up to be a human being.\" Another song I like is \"Jo Tum Muskura Do\", pictured on the romantic sequences between Mahesh and Seema early in the film. Towards the end, the film becomes increasingly more intense and touching. There are many moving scenes, and what I find particularly good about them is that they are never overdone, enhancing the emotional impact.The acting is roundly excellent. The film belongs to Mala Sinha, and she is absolutely astonishing. She displays the fear, the confusion and the pain of a wronged woman, and later the suffering and the guilt feelings of a mother who has lost her child with total conviction. Sushil Kumar, the child artist is amazing as Roshan. This is according to me one of the best performances by a child actor in Indian cinema. Speaking of child actors, Daisy Irani is fantastic as Ramesh. Manmohan Krishna is a show-stealer. He makes Abdul Rasheed, the simple and kind Muslim man, a memorable character which should set an example to all of us of how important it is to be a good human being rather than a religious person. Rajendra Kumar's character is not sympathetic, and he is appropriately hateful. The great Ashok Kumar, on the other hand, is very likable, delivering another brilliantly restrained and elegantly understated performance as Meena's loving husband. Other cast members include Nanda and Leela Chitnis, both of whom lend excellent support in smaller parts.The most disturbing scene in the film, which remains symbolic even today, is when Meena abandons the baby in the forest. The crying baby instinctively grabs her saree, as if pleading not to leave him. But she does. This is followed by an impressively miraculous moment when a snake approaches the baby, and while one would worriedly expect it to attack him, it instead stops by to guard his life. It is particularly heartbreaking to see Meena hurriedly returning to take him back, only to find he is not there anymore. But the best scene in the film happens later, when Meena and Roshan meet for the first time, obviously not knowing that they are actually a mother and son. The moment the boy breaks down as he tells her of his loneliness post a very tragic incident (see the film to understand which one) and accidentally calls her \"mom\" when she hugs him, is so deeply moving. This is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen on film, and Chopra captures it with great intensity. The film's ending is bittersweet. It is both heartbreaking and heartwarming, and the same can be said about the movie itself. 'Dhool Ka Phool' is Yash Chopra's ultimate masterwork, his first and perhaps his finest. It is one of my all-time favourite films. I highly recommend that you see this gem.\n",

            "At least Aetbaar didn't involve a love triangle. I was getting sick of seeing Bollywood films with love triangles. On the downside, there is a love story as the focus, there is a lot of overblown melodrama here, there are songs as travelogues, and a bunch of other Bollywood clichés are present. Aetbaar is also strongly derivative. It's basically an uncredited remake of James Foley's 1996 film Fear, with healthy doses of the Martin Scorsese version of Cape Fear (1991) thrown in for good measure. But if it has to be derivative, those aren't two bad films to be derivative of. The more Bollywood thrillers and horror films the better in my view.Aetbaar is told primarily from the point of view of Ria Malhotra (Bipasha Basu). She's a college student \"waiting for the right guy to come along\". She says she'll know him when she meets him. She meets him (although she doesn't think so at the time) when he, Aryan Trivedi (John Abraham), almost runs his motorcycle into her. They run into each other again later, at a disco. Aryan keeps coming on strong, and Ria falls for him. Little does she know at the time that Aryan has an extremely obsessive, violent side and basically runs his own gang. We see the violent side early on when Aryan heads out to a whorehouse for a little extracurricular activity, and his idea of a good time is assaulting his host instead of making love to her. Ironically, Ria's father, Ranveer (Amitabh Bachchan), is a well-respected surgeon who ends up treating Aryan's victim. Ranveer suspects that something is off with Aryan as soon as he meets him, and his pleas, then demands, that Ria cease seeing him begin to grow stronger. Eventually, he uncovers some \"dirty secrets\" about him. Meanwhile, Aryan's behavior begins growing more threatening. Anyone who has seen a number of thrillers will probably be able to predict a lot of the plot from this point, and of course, anyone who has seen either Fear or Cape Fear will be able to predict it in a fair amount of detail.But insofar as Vikram Bhatt focuses on creating a suspenseful thriller, Aetbaar usually works. Of course Abraham is no De Niro, but he's psychotic enough in his own way. Some of the later scenes, especially those in the climax, can suffer slightly from pushing the envelope towards ridiculousness--for example, at one point, characters do the classic U.S. action film move of outrunning a fireball, but on the other hand, the less bombastic violent material works extremely well.The sets and locations in the film are attractive and suit the material well. The Malhotras' getaway home was particularly effective and the landscape was impressive cinematographically. Of course, the same sort of bucolic but atmospheric setting was used in Cape Fear, but that makes it no less successful here.Problems arise on two fronts. The more serious flaw is that Bhatt directs his cast to horrendously overact. The melodrama couldn't be thicker. There are a few attempts at comic relief, but those are just as painful. Bachchan, in particular, makes you want to cringe when he lays on the syrup, and his English \"hip youth\" spiel towards the beginning of the film is not only cheesy, but for some reason he's almost shouting with a bizarre, affected phrasing. That's a very minor moment, but such groan-worthy tangents are littered throughout the film. I wish Bollywood directors would more often stress underplaying a role. With that type of acting instead, Aetbaar could have nearly been a gem.The other flaw arrives with Bhatt bowing to various Bollywood conventions. Ria has to fall for Aryan for the film to work, but to conform to the standard Bollywood ebb and flow, Bhatt has Aryan strangling Ria one moment, and the next moment they'll be singing a travelogue romance song to each other--you'd half expect them to get married in the next scene while Johnny Lever shows up to tell a few jokes. The build up from Aryan as love interest to Aryan as dangerous psycho needs to be gradual, and once he does something like strangle Ria, she needs to approach him with a bit more skepticism, even if she still gullibly loves him and has a bit of provisional trust in him.There are also some very odd production design elements. For some reason, Ranveer has a piano on his patio, uncovered. Pianos aren't weatherproof normally. Maybe in the film, this one is supposed to be, but it's weird enough that it distracted me. Or, Aryan is supposed to be an artist. He's done some portraits of Ria. The first one he shows her is actually quite scary looking--she seems to be melting, as if it were an \"acid portrait\"; nevertheless, she's impressed, as if it were a normal painting. Again, these are minor points, but there are many of them over the course of the film, and in the general context, they are kinks in the flow of the thriller.There are also a few dangling threads; these should have been better developed. For example, Ranveer never does find out who beat up the prostitute, even though there's a great chase scene where he comes very close. It's just dropped after that. But that's also a backhanded compliment. It should have been better developed because the idea was very good. Bhatt, who also wrote the story, had no shortage of good ideas in his details, and he can create a lot of suspense when he wants to, even if the basics were cribbed from other films.Aetbaar is nowhere near a perfect thriller, or a perfect Bollywood film. But it is well worth a look, and if you're more sympathetic to the typical Bollywood melodrama mode and other clichés, you just might love it.\n",

            "If the strange title of the film with a new meaningless word doesn't indicate towards a confused vision behind its making then its stale story-idea surely will, that once again offers the same old love triangle heading towards a routine climax with nothing engaging enough to excite you in its two hours.Beginning with a fairly long sequence (shot abroad) entirely in English without any Hindi subtitles, ISHQEDARRIYAAN thankfully moves back to India fast and then starts walking on the same ages old path of a rich man posing as a poor teacher ready to sacrifice his love for the girl he meets accidentally. Mahaakshay Chakraborty returning to screen fails to make any major impact through his calm act and so does Evelyn Sharma in her new 'fully covered' avatar trying to make an image change (on the same Friday when the other (Punjabi) release has an item number featuring her as the club dancer). Plus the rest of the cast has all average acts including a quite annoying one from an over smart kid who is visibly dressed up as a Sikh saying mature dialogues not suiting his innocent age group at all.The cinematography tries to give the film a romantic look but the art direction doesn't provide the much required support along with a usual background score. Musically it does have a few soothing numbers led by a complete Punjabi song (following the new norm). But you still don't find yourself humming anything particular while walking out of the theatre. In short, the biggest flaw of the film is its entirely predictable storyline with all dry performances/direction and a sweet twist (about the misconception) that sadly gets lost in everything routine happening on the screen seen several times before.As a result, ISHQEDARRIAAN is not only uninteresting (lost in nostalgia) but its actually quite dull to be presented as a new-age Bollywood love story to be precise.\n",

            "Lekh Tandon's Agar Tum Na Hote is an interesting, pleasant watch. The story must have been told many times, but I would mention that it involves many noteworthy points. It is about the difficulty of bringing up a child all alone without a wife, about sacrifice and dedication to a spouse, and about the pain of crippled people. This entertaining film shows the more chilled out side of Indian cinema, it flows very well, and never makes you want to fast it forward. Apart from its many great moments, it is particularly benefited by a fantastic soundtrack by maestro R.D. Burman. Two songs which stand out are the soulful \"Agar Tum Na Hote\", performed by Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar in two different versions, and especially \"Dheere Dheere\", a rather sensuous number which is perfectly performed by Asha Bhosle.Of the three leading stars, the one who impresses most is unsurprisingly the ever enigmatic Rekha. The film revolves quite around her character(s), and she is amazingly compelling, likable and restrained all through. Whether she is an honest and intelligent young woman, a dedicated and suffering wife, or a loving governess, she exudes warmth and kindness and makes the character truthful and believable. The two costars are less convincing. Rajesh Khanna plays a smart and sharp businessman, but I personally don't think he is a great choice for the role because despite the good actor that he is considered to be, he is for the most part very unnatural. Raj Babbar in quite a good role is not consistently good and at times overacts, but still he is effective enough. And the girl! Oh boy was she annoying.I recommend you to watch Agar Tum Na Hote. It's a good Hindi 1980s film. As it goes by, it becomes more intense and interesting and the ending is both heart-warming and saddening.\n",

            "Less said, better about this movie. This movie is so boring and irritating that even the task of writing a review for this movie seems so tedious. Why did they make such a movie?? How can the imagination of people go this bad? How the hell the actors agreed to act in this movie?? And how did the movie get distributors?? These will be the questions coming to an ordinary viewer's mind, while watching Ramaa.A more apt title for the movie would be Ramaa, the Loser. In the whole movie, he loses every fight, except the one in the climax, that too with the help of some kids.It is obvious from the plot that the movie is made to grab the attention of kids, and the idea of few kids getting trapped inside a video game is not so bad. In fact, it would be really interesting if executed in a proper manner. But that's where the makers have gone horribly wrong. The story is told in such a bad manner that we don't feel like taking our hands off the 'Forward' button, while watching the movie.Everybody knows that WWE is the TV show most kids like, after cartoons. So, the makers have added a WWE star in the movie, and it is none other than 'The Great Khali'. My serious advice to Khali is, stick to WWE, or join Indian army. But please don't do movies. We can tolerate bad actors, but this guy is too much beyond that. There are not much scenes for him in the movie, but whatever is there, he has done it in the worst possible way.If anyone can compete with Khali's acting in the movie, it would be the guy who played 'Kali' in the movie. Yes, you heard it right. Khali plays 'Vali' and this guy plays 'Kali'. This guy's acting is really bad, but fortunately he has got a more human-like face. Looks really matter, dude!! However both Kali and Vali are people with stoned faces.Oh, there is one more stone in the movie, the title character 'Ramaa' played by Sahil Khan. Seriously, how can one actor go this bad?? He is yet another stone in the movie, with a monkey-ish face. Really he should be honoured for maintaining the same expression throughout the movie.Tanusree Dutta looked better among others. She did her action sequences quite well. But frankly, she is not at all pretty.The movie revolves around few kids, and i forgot to mention about them. They were okay in their roles, and were obviously better than the other artists of the movie.The movie proceeds like a video game, but sadly it fails to make any impact due to bad editing. Also, there are few bad songs in the movie,especially the one Ramaa sings in the jungle. I felt like trashing my computer monitor and scream 'What the f*ck????'.After this movie, all i want is to ask the makers 'what the heck you have thought of yourself??'. But, this is not the worst movie, if you have watched 'Love.com'. :P. However, such movies increase our degree of tolerence!!\n",

He play lover, a brave hunter, an epileptic, a coward, a transvestite, a drunkard, a poetic heart and so on. Now more than twenty years after his death, when one reassess Sanjeev Kumar, this film certainly stands among his best. Yet the sense of dissatisfaction remains as what else could be called among his best. Apart from 'Dastak', 'Andhi', 'Koshish', 'Arjun Pandit', 'Shatranj ke Khiladi' and a few others, his repertoire is not that full as it should have been.Anyway, in this one you will find all that satisfy your entertainment gene.

Being a Sanjeev Kumar show, there is hardly any scope for anyone else to do something, yet Jaya Bhadhuri is in good form here and its through her character the story is told.Nice Sunday treat.\n",

            "Aakhir Kyon? is a beautiful film that details the stigma of a divorcée for an Indian woman, her struggles and humiliations, and the strength and courage required to fight and conquer. Made in the 1980s, it did a great job of staging the question, Until when must women continue to be used, abused, victimized, oppressed, and denied the right to their own unique personality? An inspirational film, the movie shows how Smita Patil's character, simply on the basis of her own merits and fortitude, is able to start life again from scratch, begin a career, achieve success and respect, and above all, create her own identity all through her diligence and hard work. Songs have wonderful lyrics. Smita Patil is amazing as is Tina Munim. Rajesh Khanna is also great.\n",

            "It's a typical masala movie, of course. But the movie wins solely because of Chiranjeevi, who at that time was the highest paid actor in India. ( He was getting Rs/- 1.25 crores per movie, compared to Rajani Kanth's 1 crore and Amitabh's 75 lakhs.) By 1992, Chiru had a successful run at the top of Tollywood for ten glorious years. Un-opposed, un-challenged he had ruled the Telugu Marquee for a decade and especially in the last couple years before this movie got released, he had gone from strength to strength.So, it was with this background Chiru went back to the Hindi audiences with his second movie. His swagger, his demeanor oozed supreme confidence and Aaj ka Goonda Raaj hit bull's eye, more so because of this than anything else.His dance for the number \"No one can dance with me, no one can take a chance with me,\" set the Bombay dance clubs on fire for more than a year after the movie hit the screen. It was the most popular dance number in all the parties that year too.If for nothing else, the movie is worth watching for this song alone. And it's a treat to Chiru's fans, when he utters the lines, \"Mujh saa na koyi yahaan,\" with an attitude almost bordering on arrogance. It it tough not to agree with him...\n",

            "Farooque Sheikh passed away on 28th December, 2013. He was the real hero in the context of our country. Idealist yet vulnerable. Sensitive yet prone to human-weaknesses. A layman sans any larger-than-life traits. A handsome boy in the traditional sense whom any girl-next-door may fall for. I am paying my tribute to him through the review of Gaman (1978).Gaman (departure / migration) is the story of Ghulaam Hasan (Farooque Sheikh) but it can be viewed as the story of millions of rural youths who migrate to cities, leaving their families behind in the villages, in their bid to earn money which they are not able to while living in their places of origin. Mumbai (then Bombay) is known as the city of dreams but does it fulfill every dreamer's dream even when the dream is as modest as to manage a reasonable living with his family ? No! A majority of the immigrants to this so-called city of dreams and many similar cities is not that fortunate. They perish after pursuing their cherished dreams throughout their lives. Life gets over but the dream remains unfulfilled. So many people die everyday in ocean-like metropolitan cities. Who cares ? Ghulaam Hasan also migrates to Mumbai (or Bombay) under hope to earn and save some money to support his family which he is not able to do while living in his village. He leaves his wife Khairoon (Smita Patil) and his ailing widow mother behind under a hope that after some time, he would have saved enough money to get reunited with them and they all will be able to live together peacefully and comfortably. He moves to Lallu Laal Tiwari (Jalaal Aagha) who belongs to his village but now lives in the metropolitan city. Now he finds that Lallu Laal himself has not become capable enough to manage a proper residence and marry his sweetheart Yashodhara (Geeta Siddhaarth) even after living and working for so many years there. Anyway, he starts his life there from cleaning the cars and after learning driving, becomes a driver. But he is never able to save so much money as to visit his village to meet his mother and wife (the train fare itself is too much) and he remains content with sending money(through money-orders) to them from time to time.Ghulaam Hasan passes his days witnessing the tragedies with many like him. But he manages to keep his dream of living with his family again intact despite the dark of despair thickening day-by-day. Khairoon keeps on writing highly emotional letters to him, urging him to come back but the monetary issue is too strong to ignore and he is not able to visit them even once. He also sees the ticklish problem of love-birds Lallu and Yashodhara when the family members of Yashodhara are hell-bent upon to forcibly send her to Dubai in order to get money and the hollow assurances of Lallu to her that he would solve the issue very shortly. But the highly tragic end of their story proves to be the last straw on the proverbial camel's back for him and he decides to leave Mumbai (or Bombay) forever and go back to his family in the village. But while standing on the railway station, he keeps on staring trains departing before his eyes, not finding himself as strong enough to act upon his emotional decision. Poverty has become the manacle in his feet, stopping him from going back.The movie does not present any solution to the hero's problem or any hope that it will be solved in foreseeable future. It also does not show whether the hero could come out of his dilemma as to whether to go back or not. How hard does the monetary stringency strike, just ask from the heart of a poor person.The movie could not be an excellent one. Despite its utterly realistic set-up and touching portrayal of the characters and their situations, it appears to be a painful saga which could not be told properly. A kind of incompleteness is felt throughout its duration and also when it is over. Perhaps the filmmaker (whose debut venture it was) was also undergoing the financial hardship while making this movie and therefore, he could not make it with perfection or the desired standard of making. Many characters have not got scope to be evolved properly.Outstanding performances have helped in covering the deficiencies of script. Farooque Sheikh has delivered a marvellous performance in the role of honest, innocent and simple Ghulaam Hasan. He was a master in underplaying. Without any gestures or dialogs, he makes the viewer feel what he is undergoing. Smita Patil has got just a few sentences to speak (mostly in her letters written to Ghulaam) but her eyes are so communicative that dialogs are not required for her. Jaidev has composed unforgettable music with the immortal lyrics of eminent Shaayars(Urdu poets) Shaharyaar and Makhdoom Mohiuddin. The issue dealt with in Gaman is still a burning one. The song in the voice of Suresh Wadkar says it all - Seene Mein Jalan Aankhon Mein Toofaan Sa Kyun Hai, Is Shahar Mein Har Shakhs Pareshaan Sa Kyun Hai (Why is there a burning inside the chest as well as something like a storm in the eyes ? Why does everybody in this city appear to be disturbed ?).\n",

            "Since I watched the movie Meet Joe Black with Pitt & Hopkins three years ago I enjoyed the story already. However this theme is not an easy one to play out considering, the supernatural and concept of 'angel of death'. Mere mortals acting this out could constitute a mocking of ideas some sincerely believe in. Even though Shukriya is no doubt broadly based on the same story lines as JoeBlack, it has however done more justice to the theme. This being simply because the theme is less alien to Indians' audience and the entire concept of angel of death is typically Asian. Take for example Oppenheimer's famous quote when he invented and detonated his famous A-bomb, which he himself claims to have taken from the Gita, relating to the personification of death. Where J.Black more closely resembles sci-fi, Shukria articulates it more spiritually refined. The idea was always an interesting one, but Anupam Sinha seems to do greater justice to the theme than Martin Brest. A western viewer however would do without the lengthy music video's scattered throughout Shukriya, which get tedious especially because of the deep language but summary translation. I however enjoyed the Indian version more, which not only combines life and after-life better, but also east and west and a number of other great equations.\n",

Who thought that would make him look cool? (It didn't, it made him look stupid and superficial.) Every song and dance was cheap, low budget and bad. And anyone with a vague familiarity with the US could tell that once again, different cities were being passed off as New York and really awful British actors/actresses were being passed off as Americans. It took me 2 weeks to watch this 2 hour atrocity. I had to keep pausing because it was so horrible. The script was bad, the acting worse, the plot ridiculous and the side story (with Rajpal Yadav) dumb. Even the clothing designs were ridiculous, making the \"so-called\" American females (the ones with British accents) look like street walkers in every scene. What a waste of time and money.

            "I can't believe this movie has not inspired any comments. It's founded upon a couple of beloved concepts for Indian films -- arranged marriages and identical twins. Here we have Kanchan (Rakhee), lovely but just misses being cloying, a traditional girl who loves animals and moves in a brilliant-colored setting that looks like fantasy Kashmir recreated on a Disney soundstage. Her problem? She's shy and nobody wants their sons to marry her. Everytime a prospective mom-in-law comes over, it winds up as, \"Can't we have the fun sister, Kamini, instead of that dull Kanchan?\" Under the circumstances, you can hardly blame the girl for being shy and self-effacing.Twin Kamini (also Rahkee) is a westernized chick, and would demand that noun, I'm sure. This being a 1971 film, she looks sorta like she's dressing herself out of SEVENTEEN magazine, about 1967. She's very outgoing and has a bunch of swinger friends she likes to spend time with, going on vacations to the Himalayas &c. During the latter, she has a meet-cute encounter with army officer Ajit (Sashi Kapoor). kamini steals food from the army base for herself and her friends, and Ajit tracks her down to the lodge where they're all staying. A musical number leads to love, as it always does in Hindi films. But she and her friends catch the midnight train to Georgia, leaving love-struck Ajit with those \"I Wonder Where She's Gone Blues.\"Meanwhile, Ajit's foster dad and the twins' parents decide that Ajit would be a great match for the difficult to marry off Kanchan.  When the two are introduced, natch, Ajit thinks she's the same hottie he met up in the mountains and he's ecstatic. Kanchan thinks it's herself that he has these feelings for and falls deliriously in love, up to a gorgeous bright pastel pregnancy fantasy that has even an old crab like the 12-stringer going, \"Awwww... \" Until the real Kamini shows up and Ajit realizes his mistake in identification, and, just like everybody else, he demands the other sister. Now we have plot complication.Out of the blue the filmmakers spring it on us that Kamini is not just the free spirit we've been spending time with, but rather, what those of us in backwoods West Virginia would spell S.L.U.T. It's an out of the hat, rather than a payoff of anything we've been prepped for. But it leads to quite a dramatic plot turnaround, and not nearly the last in this story.For the rest of it, you need to watch the movie. It's a typical Hindi musical romance, about 2:45 in length. The DVD quality is pretty good, but I have to note that while the image is 1.33:1, the original film looks like it was shot in 1.66:1, and cropping is noticeable here and there. Nothing to interfere with your enjoyment of the film, but it's amazing how fast we get spoiled by letterboxed DVDs.Kapoor's Captain Ajit is a bit of a jerk at times, though you can give him the benefit of being besotted with love for that swinging babe Kamini. Rakhee gets lots and lots of beautiful closeups (especially as Kanchan) and is pretty good in both roles. Kamini has more edge than Kanchan, who seems awfully submissive from the western perspective. But this is part of the characterization, so you really can't fault her for not being as feisty as a western audience might prefer, in the light of the story's events. On the IMDb scale, I give this a 7. The musical numbers weren't especially memorable for me. Kamini's swimsuit and near-rape scenes must have impressed the frontbenchers in Uttar Pradesh (they sure impressed the 12-stringer). I'd still like to know, where did the ocean come from in the big action finale? Weren't we amid the Himalayas just a minute or two ago?Disclaimer: I'm quite new to Hindi films and had never even seen one until June '03, when Turner Classic Movies carried a \"Salute to Bollywood\" festival which changed my life -- or at least the movie-loving portion of it. Now I just can't get enough of these films!\n",

            "Love in Tokyo was shot on location in Japan shortly after the 1964 Olympics. The story starts off in India where Ashok (Joy Mukherji) is being pressured to marry a woman he doesn't love. His elderly mother asks him to travel to Tokyo to pick up his eight year old nephew, a recently orphaned boy named Chikoo whom Ashok has never met because his family disowned his older brother after he married a Japanese woman. Ashok arrives in Tokyo only to discover that Chikoo has no intention of going to India, a country he has never seen before. Ashok hopes to win his nephew over by taking him on an expensive shopping trip, but the boy escapes when his attention is diverted by a beautiful woman named Asha (Asha Parekh), whom he sees performing a traditional Indian dance on television. Asha was also orphaned as a child and raised by her uncle in the Indian community of Tokyo. Asha's uncle wants her to marry a man she despises, a boorish, chain smoking airline pilot named Pran. Asha runs away after she discovers that the two men have cooked up a fiendish plot to get their hands on her sizable inheritance. Chikoo and Asha both end up in the same hiding place and form an alliance against their uncles. Asha protects the boy by posing as a bearded Sikh until she realizes that she has fallen in love with Ashok. She later pretends to be Chikoo's Japanese aunt in order to win Ashok's heart without being discovered. The movie has subplot involving a friend of Ashok's named Mahesh (popular comedian Mehmood) who comes to Tokyo to marry a woman from a higher class. There's a hilarious scene where Mehmood fools his potential father-in-law by posing as an \"international geisha\" who just happens to speak Hindi fluently. Love in Tokyo contains the fast paced witty dialog found in many Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn romantic comedies. It would have made an excellent 90 minute film but the actual length is almost twice that. The second half contains enough melodrama to fill a season of General Hospital and the ending is straight out of a James Bond movie. However it's important to remember that Bollywood is not Hollywood and moviegoers in each country have different expectations.The film contains two of the most beloved songs from Indian cinema: \"Love in Tokyo\" by Rafi Mohamed and \"Sayonara\" by Lata Mangeshkar. The latter is the reason that Japanese tourists in India are often greeted with a cheery \"sayonara sayonara\".\n",

            "Sometimes we come across certain films from which we just don't expect ANYTHING. But by the time it's flashed 'The End', we are simply left awestruck! Manmohan Krishna's sole directorial venture 'Noorie' is easily one such little gem.Being totally unacquainted with this film in my lifetime, I showed the stupidity of judging it from the 30-sec trailer aired on Doordarshan last year. Besides lacking in star-quotient, the low-budget feel had also put me off. Having missed it twice in the last year, I finally happened to give it a chance this Sunday... and it was certainly a case of being better late than never!The film has almost no element of the famous 'glamour quotient' that Bollywood came to be associated with in the 1970's. A shoestring budget (25 lakh!), below-par picture quality, inferior production values, lack of much scenic beauty inspite of being picturised in Kashmir and the poverty-stricken ambiance of the mountainous village was in stark contrast to the rich and glamorous setting of the big budget Bollywood flicks of those times. The star-cast wasn't big either. Barring 'Chashme Baddoor' I didn't have much memory of Farookh Shaikh; while Poonam Dhillon was best remembered for playing the 4th lead heroine in Yash Chopra's classic 'Trishul' (1978). The banner was big; but that made it all the more puzzling. What was YRF doing with a small budget film like this?The music by Khayyam was good, especially 'Aaje Re'; but there were still a couple of songs too many for a short-duration film like this.But the sole reason that made this film such a gripping watch was the wonder dog 'Khairu'. I have seen far too many Bolly-flicks to be caught off-guard with any routine plot-twists. But this one left me stumped; for until the final 5 minutes I had no idea that it's the dog who's gonna turn out to be the real 'hero' of the film!A main reason for this surprise was the unconventional plot-structure. Unlike other animal-films like 'Haathi Mere Saathi' (1971) or the recent 'Entertainment' (2014) where the animals are in focus from the start, this film doesn't give the audiences any inkling of it being an animal-centric film at all. The dog is always portrayed as a supporting character with the humans hogging all the limelight. It's only in the last half-an-hour that it appears the dog is going to play a bigger role. But even then I had expected it to be Farookh Shaikh who would play the typical hero by vanquishing the villain. So imagine one's surprise when the hero gets killed by the villain; but it's the dog who avenges the death of his mistress and turns out to be the last 'man' standing at the end!Although everyone in the cast deliver credible performances, the dog is easily the show-stealer. Be it in the scene where 'he' goes and lies in his master's graveyard or searches for some food in his forlorn hut, he touches the heart-strings of the viewers with such ease that no human actor can ever dream of. This is why animal-films are such arresting stuff!But the script is flawed at the base. Films like this should essentially be targeted towards the children. But the content of the film is such that no conservative parent would ever dare to show it too his/her child. This alone has robbed the film of a huge viewership which could have made it a humongous grosser like 'Haathi Mere Saathi'. That an experienced campaigner like Yash Chopra also didn't intrude on this is hard to understand. Perhaps he wanted to lend unconditional support to the new breed of formula-breaking film-makers, just like he himself! That he was vindicated goes without saying as the film still became a 'super hit', which shows how much the film was loved by the adults themselves!One feels if the script was focused more on 'Khairu' and his revenge, then it could have been a much more captivating experience. But in that case it would have robbed the film of its 'shock-value' which was easily the biggest takeaway of the movie.Those were the times when superstars like Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Shashi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, etc would join forces to set the cash-registers jingling. But here it was a 'wonder canine' who had alone set the box-office on fire!\n",

Anand teamed up with Vinod Khanna again in Maha-sangram; a complete masala entertainer featuring an ensemble cast and packing in every ingredient which the '90s audience loved. Action, emotions, romance, item songs, comedy - this was an all in one package!!Vinod was cast opposite his Dayavan (1988) heroine Madhuri Dixit and she set the screen on fire with her rain drenched number \"I love you. Pyar karu chu, zhala mala prem zhalaa\". Govinda as Khanna's younger bro got to romance the debutant Shaheen forming a triangle with her real life hubby Sumeet Saigal. But the real showstopper of Maha-sangram was Aditya Panscholi cast as the hot headed gangster 'Chota Godhaa' who literally breathes fire. Sonu Walia got to seduce the stud..but in vain!! This film is one of Aditya's career best act alongside Saathi (1991) and Aatish (1994). In fact, Panscholi was typecasted as the gangster with a heart in movies like Naamcheen (1991) and Game (1993) after this fabulous performance.Gulshan Grover was another memorable character with his popular punchline \"Humare Punjab mein aisa hota hai..\". Amjad Khan was convincing as the Don 'Bada Godhaa' in one of his last onscreen appearances. He passed away two years later.All in all, Maha-sangram was a complete mass entertainer and the first weekend crowd at Sundaram Cinema, Worli confirmed the same with whistles and cheers. Surprisingly, the film dipped from second week onwards and settled in average grosser category. Probably due to the rampant video piracy in those days but frankly, this one deserved to do better. It is one of my personal favourite masala movies of that era!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "In the second half of Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahi (1991), Aamir Khan sets for an impromptu ball-dance jig with Pooja Bhatt when a song is playing on the radio in the background. That song was 'Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke, Hum Se Kuch Na Boliye'. The song came from the 1957 Dev Anand film 'Nau Do Gyarah' and this was perhaps Mahesh Bhatt's way of paying a subtle tribute to the film from which it took faint references. Interestingly Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahi was a remake of Raj Kapoor – Nargis' 1956 classic 'Chori Chori' which in turn was remake of Frank Capra's Oscar winning 'It Happened One Night'. Even 'Nau Do Gyarah' that released one year after Chori Chori borrowed faintly from Capra's film.Madan (Dev Anand) gets a letter from his uncle claiming that he is the heir of his uncle's property. He sets on a road journey in a mini-truck to meet his uncle. En route he meets a girl Raksha (Kalpana Kartik) who has run away from her marriage to a man of disrepute, Surjit (Jeevan) and has landed in Madan's truck. Madan learns through his friend Radhe (Madan Puri) that his uncle is no more and the property has been taken over by his uncle's wife (Lalita Pawar) and son Kuldeep (Rashid Khan). To unveil the mystery behind his uncle's death and get hold of his second modified legal will, Madan reaches Mahabaleshwar to work as a manager at Kuldeep's estate while Raksha poses as his wife. But suddenly Surjit lands at the place and starts manipulating things.Vijay Anand made an impressive debut as a director with Nau Do Gyarah. He came up with a creased-out screenplay and had well-etched character conflicts. Also the writing was multidimensional where he smartly interlinked Madan's property track with Raksha's runaway bride track by the pre-climax. The story had every element from romance, music, suspense, thriller to the trademark jaydaad-ki-ladaai (a standard formula of yesteryear Bollywood). The title had both symbolic and literal connotations. Nau Do Gyarah is a Hindi idiom that indicates 'run away', while the property that Madan is to inherit from his uncle is in form of real estate worth nine (nau) lakhs and bank assets worth two (do) lakhs which sums up to eleven (gyarah) lakhs.Other than Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahi¸ Nau Do Gyarah had some other offshoots as well. The runaway bride element was subsequently used in Caravan (1971) and Kati Patang (1970). In fact the entire Prem Chopra-Bindu-Asha Parekh track in Kati Patang is feebly reminiscent of Jeevan-Shashikala-Kalpana Kartik track in this film. Mahesh Bhatt's tribute to the Anands continued as he directed Aamir Khan in another film named Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke (a song from Nau Do Gyarah).The ever-dependable S D Burman's melodious musical score was one of the strong assets of Nau Do Gyarah. 'Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke',' Aankhon Mein Kya Ji' and 'Aaja Panchi Akela Hain' are still fresh in minds of music lovers. Vijay Anand picturized the climax song 'See Le Zubaan' on Shashikala in the same way that the climax song 'Kahin Pe Nigahen, Kahin Pe Nishana' was shot on Waheeda Rehman in Navketan's earlier production CID. Shashikala symbolically narrates the circumstances in the song to Jeevan who is in hiding. Majrooh Sultaanpuri's lyrics had awakened the then moral police when he penned lines like 'Achal Mein Kya Ji – Ajab Si Hulchul' in the duet Aankhon Mein Kya Ji. Reportedly, Majrooh created a furor in the 1950s in the same manner and for the same reason for which Anand Bakshi created a controversy over 'Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai' in 1993.The film was decently shot by cinematographer V. Ratra in the serene hill station of Mahabaleshwar. The background score was competent and complemented the scenes.Dev Anand was charming as always and Kalpana Kartik was beautiful, both, in her looks and act. The real-life couple had a comfortable and refreshing on screen chemistry. This was Kalpana Kartik's last film as an actress. All other character actors were competent.Nau Do Gyarah is so gripping and entertaining that you won't run away from it for a moment. Worth a watch!Gaurav Malani\n",

Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal, as in all Mahesh Bhatt movies, are ACE. Both have been given some of the best lines in the movie and boy do they deliver. Their confrontation scenes make you realise their importance in a Mahesh Bhatt movie. The story and the dialogues from Suraj-Sanim are applause worthy.\n",

            "Qahar (Hindi for 'Calamity') is a good action movie with lots of great stunts. The movie has 3 heroes, including the 2 biggest action heroes of Bollywood, Sunil Shetty and Sunny Deol (my favorite star) with one more guy. This is the typical revenge story like Ghayal, Ghatak, Ziddi, etc. The way the story is told is interesting. There are so many villains in this movie, and the mortal combat between both sides makes this action-packed film worth watching. Sunny is playing the messiah with the other guy, and Sunil is the good cop, who joins them to smash the evil. Good ALWAYS wins over evil. The movie is true to its title, and everyone does well. Recommended for action fans!\n",

            "Ram and Sadhna are a married couple. Ram is a witty and compromising man while Sadhna is an impulsive, decisive and hasty woman. When Ram accidentally has a one-time affair with Sadhna's recently widowed friend Urvashi, Sadhna immediately files for divorce. Right after the separation she finds out she is pregnant but she gets determined to bring her child up single-handedly and not return to Ram. Years go by, the couple's son, Raju, is now 10 years old, Sadhna gets a job as a clerk at a company where Ram works as a manager. Ironically, he hires a flat nearby Sadhna's house. Sadhna is still very angry and cannot forgive Ram for his infidelity, while Ram tries to get close to Raju.Ek Hi Bool is well written, narrated and acted. It is quite simple in execution, and thus its impact is effective. The film is an enjoyable mix of comedy and drama, and thankfully, it does not rely too heavily on sentimentality, though there are some glitches her and there. The dialogue is for the most part quite witty, and many of the situations are identifiable, and that's what makes the film entertaining all through. Ek Hi Bhool deals with the complexity of marriage and divorce, and one must note the depiction of middle-class families, their troubles and daily struggles, which is generally well done (not as good as in Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, but still pretty good). Laxmikant-Pyarelal's music is very nice.As far as acting goes, this film is unsurprisingly Rekha's film. She is wonderfully in sync with the hot-tempered, funny and nop-nonsense Sadhna, even though the script actually never really utilises her true talent. You can cry with her, laugh with her, or just sit and be stunned by her beauty. Her dialogue delivery and mannerisms are very good, her hysterics are hilariously entertaining, while her dramatic scenes are compelling. This is a very colourful performance. Jeetendra too performs well. Shabana Azmi makes a wonderful guest appearance as Meena, Sadhna's beautiful and intelligent friend. Asrani, Yunus Parvez and Leela Mishra lend adequate support, and the kids are alright.'Ek Hi Bhool' means 'Just One Mistake'. The viewers may have different opinions regarding who the mistake was actually made by - the husband or the wife. It is a movie with a message effectively conveyed through tears and laughs. Not great or flawless but definitely enjoyable. I recommend.\n",

            "Jackie and Anil were one of the hit pairings during 80s and 90s Their bonding made several films click, this was their first film together. Andar Bahar is a remake of 48 Hrs and it's directed by Raj Sippy who made Satte Pe Satta(too a remake). Andar bahar is quite watchable though it didn't work that time much. Anil and Jackie were 2 newcomers who had joined Bollywood a year back. The film has Jackie play a cop and Anil a thief, they combine to catch Danny. The film does have it's normal bollywood clichés of 80s but yet it's quite watchable. Anil's lusty character however does seem different for a bollywood film.Direction is decent Music by RD Burman is quite okay, the title song being catchy,rest are okay Raj Sippy reuses the background score of Babu in Satte pe Satta for Danny Danzongpa's character.Jackie Shroff fresh after the success of HERO, is decent as the cop a bit raw as in those days Anil Kapoor played a tapori in Mashaal too and does a superb job, their chemistry is awesome. Moon Moon Sen is good, Gulshan Grover is excellent Danny is superb as the villain, Kim(Danny's gf that time) is okay The film has cameos from that time actresses like Kaajal Kiran\n",

            "I already knew that this film is copied from the Hollywood flick The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. But I still watched it as I wanted to see how the director adapted the film to the Indian sensibilities.I must say that the film was quite interesting. The villainess in this film is not shown as a plain evil determined to wreck havoc in the lives of those who destroyed her life. Basically, this film shows us two sides to humanity, the good and the bad. And provides an interesting counterpoint to these two sides. I felt bad for the girl (Anu Agarwal) who has lost her husband and her unborn child. But her husband is shown as an evil doctor who molests his female patients.Talking about the minuses of this film, I would say there are two things which might not go well with the Indian audience. The heroine's (Jaya Prada) friend is shown constantly smoking. She even smokes in front of her friend's baby, a total no-go for an Indian audience. And in the climax scene, the villainess uses a baseball bat to attack the hero. Back in the early 90s, baseball was not even so popular in India. Just because the vamp in the Hollywood original uses a baseball bat, the director decided to make the vamp use a baseball bat. This was so irrelevant back then. She could've used a hockey or a cricket bat to make the scene relevant to the 90's timeline. Duh! Performances from the lead casts are really very good. Jeetendra is in top form. Jaya Prada fitted into her character very well. But the credit has to given especially to Anu Agarwal who plays a disillusioned vamp to the hilt. Puneet Issar and Varsha Usgaonkar were good in their respective roles.Barring the title track, all the songs were passable.Overall, a decent entertainer! You can watch it with your family.\n",

            "Beginning with a couple speaking about their affair in broken Punjabi, followed by a fake Sikh character given a weird get up and all forced lines just to create some silly laughs, BADMASHIYAAN straight away gives you the feeling of an amateurish attempt by the team in its first five minutes itself making a bad impression. The poor show (set in Chandigarh) continues till the next 30 minutes till you get to know that it's actually all about a con-woman and her innocent romantic victims desperately looking for their true love that instantly makes you recall LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL or the recent DOLLY KI DOLI revolving around few similar concepts.Progressing further introducing more of its key characters, it frankly looks like one of those self-sponsored projects by the new actors themselves, since none of them is able to make any kind of noticeable impact on the viewers. The narration fails to hold your interest for most of its duration (divided into three sections) and it all starts falling in line towards the finale only with some kind of freshness and interesting moments.Actually the three distinctive plot lines in its script have been thought well but not written accordingly creating boredom in the middle and the same can be said about its direction too giving you nothing to praise in those two hours with performances ranging from below average to just bearable. The whole film revolves around the character of Suzanna who plays it over dramatically looking good only in a few sequences and Sidhant as her lover seems like a clone of Sushant Singh Rajput playing it poorly. Among the more experienced ones, Karan Mehra's act remains highly inspired from Shah Rukh Khan throughout whereas the debutant Gunjan Malhotra turns out to be the decent one as compared to the rest. Surprisingly Sharib Hashmi of FILMISTAAN fame is not able to give any extraordinary performance here as the Don, but he still remains the best among them all underplaying the role as required. Continuing the poor show in its music and background score, BADMASHIYAAN is not at all funny or thrilling as per its exciting con theme. And the only time you feel like seeing something engaging is the climax wherein all twists and turns get revealed interconnecting the three subplots together in an interesting manner (that again makes you recall many English films based on this specific format).So one might not mind watching the film on a channel along with some multitasking going on utilizing the two hours, but opting for it at a costly multiplex is certainly not recommended.\n",

            "This unheralded little production from the early 80's is quite possibly one of the finest horror films to emerge from Bollywood. The film focuses on a small middle class, well educated South Indian family that is having to come to terms with some financial difficulties and is in the process of tightening the financial belt but at the cost of some people who were quiet loyal to this family.The first half hour of the film is a gradual build up of tension where the audience is expecting the worst but nothing actually happens. Then Uma(padmini kolapuri) suffers her first fit & from here onwards the film takes a complete u turn , roller coasting in witchcraft, wizardry & exorcism, culminating in a chilling final scene where spirits are revoked from the dead.This film is remarkable among Bollywood horror films for its sheer subtlety and lack of typical hackneyed horror techniques that are such the hallmark of the genre. This is perhaps the only tale of possession that doesn't involve spinning heads, levitation scenes, flying vomit and objects and the like. Though it is similar to The Exorcist in that the target of an evil, disgruntled spirit is a young school going pubescent girl, that is really where the similarity ends. Gehrayee eschews cheap horror thrills and relies on its gripping plot and excellent performances to make it work. There are no insufferable comedians (like Jagdeep, Rajendranath, Satish Shah) to endure this time around and nor are there cheesy gore or special effects. Padmini Kolhapure is brilliant as Uma. She may not have been a traditional beauty but what she lacked in bombshell looks, she made up for with heaps of delightful charm and natural spontaneity. After Jaya Bhaduri retired, Padmini stepped in to fill the vacuum with the same good-natured wholesome, infectious free spirit. In Gehrayee, Padmini turns in a remarkable performance especially considering she was barely 12 in reality. She is totally natural as the kid slowly taken over by an evil spirit, never self conscious or overwrought. It's a superb performance by an actress who deserves to be remembered as one of Bollywood's finest performers of the 80's.Full marks to the director for having the courage to refuse the cheap, loud gimmickry that is virtually inherent in the genre. Gehrayee is a stylish, excellently acted, intriguing film that works on various levels; about a young girl experiencing the confusion of puberty, a family struggling under the strain of its dark secrets, the authoritarian father as well as the more obvious story about the disgruntled spirit and the rape of the land as well as tradition methods pitted against modern science and education. Gehrayee is truly an exceptional Bollywood horror film.\n",

            "Call it a day--or evening--in the life of two Indian drag queens. Yes, one of the best aspects of Gulabi Aaina or The Pink Mirror is that the urban Indian gay male-mainly drag queen, yes, but also the 'straight acting' one is mirrored on screen. And being able to relate to the characters makes the film more funny, more touching for this audience more than for any other. No, the non-Indian audience, of any sexual orientation, will definitely find it entertaining too. Most Indian, straight, male viewers though may not approve of the in-your-face sexuality of Shabo and Bibbo. Their appearance, their language, their body language will, of course, be termed coarse, and, by some, even obscene--as the Indian censors termed it. i shall not go into the debate over definitions of obscenity but suffice to say that the film is not obscene, especially in comparison with some of the pretentious stuff that passes for art or the obscenely expensive trash that is hyped by the media. In Gulabi Aaina, Sridhar has presented reality--it may not be everyone's reality, it may even embarrass the same people it portrays, but it's a wickedly funny truth that you see in the mirror. Now, why an eight rating... (by the way, i can't comment on the technical aspects or the sub-titling in English) The acting is not perfect--it would be obvious that this is a cast relatively new to being in front of the camera. overall the bitchiness of the two drag queens is overdone, to the point where it acquires a tinge of harmful meanness. the HIV angle is at least a little contrived, maybe even unnecessary. sometimes the indulgent singing by the characters goes on for far too long...(maybe, Sridhar could have managed to cut down the film just enough to qualify this as a short film.) these are some minor irritants to an otherwise enjoyable film.\n",

            "After his father's death, a young man finds that the long-lost sister of his girlfriend has resurfaced with the needed part to a map to a great treasure only to find a strange creature raised and targeting the group forcing them to deal with it while finding the treasure.This here was quite the fun and enjoyable offering. What really makes this one work is the fact that it displays quite a lot of impressive elements familiar with more traditional offerings. The opening here, where the creature is seen roaming the underground catacombs gives this a solid start while leading nicely into the need to capture the evil magician, as well as the rescue of the kidnapping daughters, sets this off on a rather fun action-packed note with a bit more of a truly international flair. The search for the treasure out in the wilderness comes off rather fun with the multitude of fist-fights against the henchmen and their initial struggles in getting to the mansion for safety require them to run into the creature in the underground catacombs while the whole affair taking place during a raging thunderstorm gives it a chilling atmosphere that's incredibly impressive. That carries on into the first exploration of the caves where they come into contact with the creature for the first time who launches several great strikes against the two groups which make the scenes rather fun as well as getting the atmosphere from the creepy location. There's also the great fun of fighting the creature inside the temple, where it leads several really chilling encounters against the villagers trying to stop it as there's plenty to enjoy in the extended one-on-one fight with the friend or the numerous tactics of the villagers to stop it which make for a thrilling finale as they utilize quite an inventive technique to finally stop it. As well, the fact that this one doesn't indulge in as many other fabled elements from the genre here where it doesn't really indulge in useless tangents to add on to the running time, only has two musical numbers and really tones down the silly, slapstick comedy really give this a boost. That makes for a universal feeling here where it still has plenty of local flavor but isn't strictly trapped in with so many elements as to make it strictly identifiable as belonging to that region. Along with the great atmosphere here while at the hotel or underground in the caves, these here really make this one feel quite international in approach which gives this a fun and appealing style. While these here make it work, there are a few minor flaws here. The main issue is the fact that there's little need for the lecherous companion here as his storyline doesn't amount to anything other than the repetition of the same thing over and over and even manages to cause the film to run in circles which causes the film to run a little too long as it has to deal with his storyline that really didn't need to be there. The other small factor here is the confusion over the creatures' origins, which is given two distinct possible origins and very little of the film makes it clear what he's supposed to be. Otherwise, this one was quite the impressive effort.Rated Unrated/PG: Violence.\n",

            "According to a list compiled by IMDb, hardly 10 of the 81 most significant changes in actors' looks in popular cinema have been by women. Namely, Natalie Portman, Nicole Kidman, Ellyn Burstyn, Demi Moore, Charlize Theron, Helena Bohman Carter, Emma Thompson, Hillary Swank, and Cameron Diaz. They have shaved their hair, chapped, freckled and scorched their skin, put on weight, all to literally get into the skin of their characters and made themselves look (conventionally) less attractive. The latest addition to them all comes from unexpected quarters. Bollywood, infamous for it's assembly line that boxes glamor dolls into arm candy roles, observes Isha Koppikhar in a new avatar called Shabri. Inspired by a true story, she sheds her graces to acquire the looks of a slum dweller that evolves into a legendary gangster. Shabri's story narrates a greater phenomenon in turbulent times, the rise of female criminality. Westernization and industrialization have driven the traditional woman from the domestic space to the productive job sector, (as Shabri runs a flour mill). Added responsibilities, stress and failure to attain their socially defined goals drive frustration and pave the ways of their families into crime. The entry of Shabri represents and strikingly resonates with this rising demographic. She rises from the ashes of poverty forced by survival to climb into the snake pit of political power in the Mumbai underworld.The meticulous eyes of Lalit Marathe cover every clinical aspect, be it the sewed shreds on her blouse, or her brother stealing her slippers because his own pair is torn and they can't afford new ones. The camera shots and angles are absolutely novel and brilliant. They show the characters in poignant frames and settings, putting together nothing less than a work of art. Simple objects like a dead tree branch, a window or a balcony are used as props and benchmarks to express the moods of the characters. Feels like the arrival of Louvre in the Mumbai underworld. Throughout the film, Shabri's presence is more powerful than words, her silence more deafening than screams. As she rests her head on a brick wall while mourning the loss of a loved one, and as her tearful eyes look up in a slant to her captor that takes her home, grief gives way to fury. The supporting cast plays their part just right, with the finesse and the pace that fits the mood of the film. The villain's character is especially well developed, as he depicts a variety of emotions, not just negative tones, leading him to become one more of the characters in the film rather than just a bad guy. Shabri's relationship with Murad is very well distanced, as well as crafted. Their platonic coexistence has romantic roots, but ones that remain unspoken of. There are many tender moments in the film where bringing closure to the scene would set the film on the path of a commercial potboiler. However as a maestro would, the director holds back, allowing the viewer's imagination to execute the task. A fascinating character in the film is Inspector Quazi. Various psychology theories suggest that one of the deepest roots to human motivation is that of seeking stimulation, and Quazi fits it perfectly. A man of outstanding capabilities who is bored with the mundane routine of his job, he strives to reinvent his job such that he may be amused and entertained. He lives his life with the pursuit of unleashing chaos, aspiring to keep the reins of all the players of the game in his own hands. What sets this movie a class apart is that the brutality and action is not driven to over kill. It makes a gritty as well as a crisp viewing experience. There isn't an abundance or overflow of blood, nor any loudness in the expressions of those in it. Fights are swift and real, not orchestrated, nor elaborate. The colors are faded and blood is dark red, not vermilion. Gunshots are snappy, and deaths of important characters devoid of melodrama. From the waters lapping against the shore at low tide at the docks, to the hand rubbed polish on Rawat's vintage Jaguar, Shabri is a vividly constructed original script as well as a well narrated tale. Unlike many others, it does not end where the audience starts to leave the theater. It ties up the loose ends, relates to how life proceeds for each of the significant characters, and how the dark night gives way to dawn. The aftertaste it leaves behind is not necessarily sweet, but one that perfectly whets the viewers' appetite.The action role in a Saree also makes Shabri a cultural icon. Since gender equality and feminist themes in media originated in western nations, most action roles enacted by women in Bollywood have been in western attires (with the added flexibility in physical movement). But unlike the many who dress as Lara Croft to depict an action performance, Shabri kicks, shoots, jumps, and runs in a tattered Saree. Being the first female actor that embraces her action role with an Indian identity, she doesn't imitate a fighting man. She's a woman that fights as herself. With this performance, Isha Koppikhar challenges the corridors of power in Bollywood just as the fictitious Shabri does to her male counterparts. In a land where men pursue fair and handsome and women's dowry rates correlate with the sales of fair and lovely creams, she displays the courage to add more layers of darkness to her complexion. She could evoke mourning for the demise of porcelain beauty, or celebrations for the arrival of character and essence in a woman. But her charms invade our senses as the touch of raindrops on a heated brick wall. Unnerving, yet soothing and memorable.\n",

            "Sanjeev Kumar and Raakhee play a middle-aged couple who visit different households in search of dysfunctional couples and play their cards to save their failing marriages and solve all their marital problems. The concept is really unusual for a Hindi film, but it's a light film which works as a nice social comedy with an interesting commentary on marriage, relationships, social class, and caste discrimination. Of course, as a mainstream Hindi film some of these important issues are not dealt with in the right amount of depth required, and it's a little exaggerated here and there, but it works within the context of the film, which is really nice entertainment.The film focuses on two concurrent episodes where our heroes aim their 'repair project' at two unlikely couples who have probably been married by mistake - a rich guy finds that his bride is an uneducated village woman, and a poor simple guy marries an outgoing, modern woman from a wealthy family who leads a career and is unwilling to succumb to domesticity. Obviously, had the two pairs swapped partners for good, it would have been a perfect match for all. The moral stand here is a little twisted as the problem is interpreted to lie more with the women, but I'm glad no one is seen as a total villain and each one is a product of their upbringing and early environment.The film's comic tone, mood, and success rests on the charisma of Kumar and Raakhee, who play their roles with a nice touch of humour and vigor. They work so well together (and appear as a duo in almost every scene) it's almost impossible to discuss each performance separately. The cast in general boasts of great names. Deepti Naval plays the innocent, demure wife who's rejected by her rich alcoholic husband, and she's good although this self-victimizing attitude is tough to accept. Rakesh Roshan is okay while Amol Palekar is usually dependable. Sarika is wonderful as she always is, and Lalita Pawar is typically loud, funny and ultimately great.Shriman Shrimati is enjoyable from start to finish and it addresses nice themes which I wish had been dealt with better or less artificially. The music by Rajesh Roshan is very good in the beautiful voices of Kishore Kumar and the divine Lata Mangeshkar. The conclusion of the story provides some nice realisations on the part of the characters but also presents an unexpected twist where the lead couple explain the reason for their mission in the world. It was made by filmmakers from the south, and I learn that the concept was so successful it was made in other languages as well. I'm not sure this film is to everyone's taste, but I believe it's highly watchable for those fond of Hindi comedies.\n",

            "A very well-made movie, reflecting the current corrupt times in India, especially in Bombay City. Of particular interest is the definition of \"P.O.L.I.C.E.\", which is supposed to mean P - Polite, O- Obedient, L- Loyal, I- Intelligent, C- Courteous, and E - Efficient.In this movie a corrupt police inspector I.M. Ghodbole (Mukesh Tiwari) passionately re-defines P.O.L.I.C.E. as P- Power, O- Order, L- Liar, I- Incompetent, C-Corrupt, and E - Encounter. Unfortunately, as is systemic racism deeply embedded in Canada and the United States, so is corruption in India. There are solutions, but those solutions need tough love, and a will to change things for the better. This movie justifiably states that the courts and the law are available for a few affluent individuals; that people in power are above the law; and a non-existent media. Just my two cents.\n",

A lot of things were missing, Arshad Warsi did pretty well, but playing Jack Black's part is not even gonna be on his level. Just another typical bolly movie leaving u with a very minimal laughter. I wouldn't say it was terrible, but it was a mediocre performance. If u like Hollywood movies, then skip this and watch Saving Silverman instead, trust me you will be peeing ur self from laughter.\n",

            "In general, the movie is about a seemingly happily married couple (but yet there are hints of a hidden secret) who's life is interrupted when an ex lover contacts the husband and decides to take him to Goa to visit their son about whom the husband was not aware of until recently. Confusing? Neither of them has seen the son and the ex-girlfriend has just released herself a mental institution after 12 years.Some DVD versions have an incorrect synopsis in the back of the cover. It was originally a misleading preview written by one of the worst movie critics Trash Adarsh on his website Indiafm. The movie actually is completely different from what he states. Ria wasn't schizophrenic. She had borderline personality disorder with bipolar symptoms. If you're wondering which movie the director shamelessly ripped-off, then that would be 'Forever Lulu'. Shashi Ranjan proves to be a pathetic director for ruthlessly plagiarizing almost every frame of 'Forever Lulu'. 'Dobara' is slightly slow-paced during the first hour. In the second half, the screenplay loses focus by introducing a sudden twist. It's also weird that Raveena's character all of a sudden does not need any medication for her chronic condition. Such flaws are amateurish and could have easily been avoided. 'Dobara' would have been a more interesting flick had it only stayed focused on the three main characters. The strength of the movie is the superb acting by the women. Both Raveena Tandon and Mahima Chaudhry gave outstanding performances. The chemistry and display of ambivalence between them is amazing. Jackie Shroff is boring at times otherwise he is okay at best. He's a miscast and a too old to be paired opposite Mahima and Raveena in a role like this. The songs are likable and appropriately fitted into the film as it provides a break from the slow pace. I hope at least those weren't ripped off.Overall, Mahima Chaudhry and Raveena Tandon's performances deserve to be acknowledged but Shashi Ranjan gets no positive praise from me because he is nothing but a hack.\n",

            "The 1991 flick marked the debut of Karishma Kapoor the granddaughter of the late Raj Kapoor.But this was a wrong movie to launch her.The movie was a semi hit but Karishma was criticized.She wore hot pants,Bikinis,Ugly eyes and to forget bad hair.She was only 16 then and her mother igned this for her.Karishma was the first woman in the Kapoor family to debut in the Bollywood the second was Kareena in Refugee in 2000.The hero is unknown and long forgotten.The directer Murali Mohan Rao film was lackluster.Anyway it took 5 years for Karishma to become a star.She worked with David Dawan in hits like Raja Babu,Coolie no 1,Saajan chale Sasural,Judwaa,Hero no 1,Biwi No 1,Haseena Man Jayenge and Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge.Anyway they were not her hits at all.She became a star with Raja Hindustani.And the rest i have to say is she became popular.She accomplished a lot in Dil To Pagal Hai,Fiza,Zubeidaa and Shakti.Her last movie to date is Suneel Darshans \"Mere Jeevan Saathi\"where she essayed a negative role.The movie became a Disaster and after that she left.As a woman she is Beautiful,Stunning and Gorgeous.Her acting is lousy in movies and not to forget childish acting\n",

Rekha also puts in a fine performance, as does the rest of the cast. Interestingly, almost everyone in this movie is either a villain or is out to make a quick buck... very different from the average movie which typically has one or two villains. 'Ghazab' is heartrending at times, but also exciting, fun and very amusing. The young couple who come in to pretend to be Ajay's mother and brother are hilarious. Ajay himself is both an extremely irritating and annoying; and very funny character - great comic timing. The story is good, the direction is fantastic and Dharmendra... whoa!!

            "Wow. Whenever I find myself watching allegedly show stopping choreography in new Bollywood films which style themselves as fantasies, this sense of total boredom always creeps in at the sheer unimaginative nature of the dance routines. They're ubiquitous of course. Everyone prances about like their fresh from the Brian Rogers Dance Connection on Seaside Special, same kicks, same cutaways, the lot.And then I saw Navrang on satellite. Wow. This is a truly fantastical film. It looks genuinely unearthly. The plot: 19th Century sage/poet/artistic type Divakar (Mahipal, looking uncannily like William L Petersen circa Manhunter)has lost his muse. This is a time of British Imperial rule (booo), but there's no overt agenda here. Its a simple story via which Divakar starts to be tormented by his artists' block. Which is where Sandhya comes in. In a dual role of his beloved and his muse she performs some gob smacking classically inspired pieces. There's this scene where she's performing a kathak (?) style routine, balancing about 10 water pots on her head, she even bends down whilst balancing them on her head (no strings). There's fantasy set pieces that are simply beautiful too, notably the piece where she's in the temple, and it morphs into a whole white-out room full of giant temple bells, each with a dancer on the ringer, swaying to the music. This is up there with the glorious surreal set designs of some of the Hollywood musicals of the 30's, and the Powwll & Pressburger film \"The Red Shoes\" in terms of real skill on display. they make it all look so simple too.\n",

            "Kucch Love Jaissa is a woman oriented film where a middle aged home keeper ( Shefaali Shah as Madhu Saxena ) longs for a change and space in her daily monotonous life. Her's is an upper middle class family consisting of a decent and understanding husband ( Sumeet Raghavan,an ad agency executive ) and two adorable school going kids.What else can a spouse/ mother long for ?. She enjoys all goodies of life.Now the first twist comes. For some unexplained reasons  ( perhaps she has to manage the daily chores by her self or /and ,having been neglected in the decision making sphere ) she  ( after seeing off her kids to school and the husband to office) leaves her home for an unannounced outing ,a kind of an escapade. The immediate she does is to buy   a brand new car on her husband's credit card.To kill time she window shops  at a multiplex and there after walks into a restaurant for a bite.It's here that the second twist comes.  She meets a mysterious character ( Rahul Bose as Raghav).Who is he ?His mannerisms ,the rugged looks and  the way of eating food puzzles her.Any way,tele pathy makes her believe in this stranger.As directed, she moves along  with this  stranger in her car to places never visited earlier.Here the movie becomes a roadie in a metro. The third twist comes in the climax. The reality of the stranger is revealed  ( he turns out to be an outlaw on the run ) . Also,the day being her birthday,makes her return home. The pluses  of KLJ - Shefaali Shah is outstanding in her full fledged role as the lady in the  pink on the move ( the pink dress suits her to the T ).She has a towering screen presence.Young girls entering films have a lot to learn from the acting abilities of Shefaali Didi/ auntie. Rahul Bose conveys a lot with his mono -syllables way of conversation.The casting   is apt.Performances are good. Barnali Ray Shukla ,is a writer/ director with a promise.Shefali Shah ,the mother,is assured that her school going daughter would not get a-strayed in a relationship with a boy ( surprisingly the daughter is well versed with sensitive issues of  sex and love at her tender age ). The one sided conversations on the cell add to the narrative. The minuses of KLJ -The characterization of Rahul Bose is sketchy and unclear.Is Shefaali Shah so naive as to accompany a stranger throughout the day unmindful of her kids coming back from school? Film after film it's being noticed that the new breed of singers are unable to hold their breath in the ending notes.Music directors must make a note of this.Neetu Chandra,otherwise a good actress,continues to be type cast as the gangster's mole film after film.Om Puri is wasted in a parental role.Makrand Deshpande hardly gets noticed in his cameo of the telephone booth owner. All in all,KLJ is a different kind of a film that could be enjoyed by the middle age viewers\n",

            "Continuing his struggle to make a major breakthrough as an actor- producer (and director too), Ganesh Acharya comes up with another below average, inspired project HEY BRO directed by Ajay Chandhok that fails to make any sort of impact on the viewers be it story, execution, music or performances.In fact the films raises a valid question that who actually approves a decent amount of money to be spent on such LOUD products served as comedies to torture the helpless viewers becoming a constant, unavoidable feature of our Hindi film industry. Moreover its really surprising to see the film made on an ages old concept of separated twin brothers (not resembling each other), inspired from the English flick TWINS (1988) which was also seen in HUMSE BADHKAR KAUN released in 1998.The amateurish writing rarely offers any good funny scenes in this 113 minutes film and the songs too range from poor to average including the most publicized \"Birju\" featuring cameos of Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh and Prabhu Deva. Adding to the uninteresting proceedings even Govinda (in a scene) and Mahie Gill (in an item song) fail to deliver anything engaging along with the other key performers playing their respective characters.In short this seems to be made with a vision still hanging somewhere in the 90s that doesn't work at all despite the help offered by many big names of the industry so generously.\n",

            "Raj Khosla's romantic 'adventurous' thriller 'Solva Saal' is an entertaining 'masala' flick starring the hit duo: Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman. It's got pretty much all the ingredients that make a Hindi film entertaining except that there are some moments that derail from the main plot. Most of the film takes place in one night. I don't see what relevance the title has to the film. Dev and Waheeda's strong chemistry stands out and both act very well. Waheeda is stubborn and lovely while Dev is cool, sophisticated and charming. Their scenes together make the movie worth the while. The songs are beautiful. In spite of its flaws, Khosla does a decent job and keeps the film moving. Perhaps some editing would have helped mend the uneven pace.''Solva Saal' is a fun watch.\n",

            "Hukumat was released in the year 1987 and was the first film that brought dharmendra and director Anil Sharma together.The duo went on to perform several successful films together such as Elan-e-Jung,Tahalka, Farishtay and most recently Apne.Dharmendra proved to be the priceless jewel for anil sharma as all of their films together were resounding Successes.Before the release of Hukumat,dharmendra was brimming from an unsuccessful spell at the time based on box-office collections.Despite starring in critically-acclaimed and extremely entertaining movies like Ghulami, Sitamgar, Sultanat, surprisingly hits kept eluding dharmendra which was quite unusual as he was still one of the top-rated and bankable stars, even at 50 plus.But then came the year 1987,where dharmendra achieved a remarkable feat.he showed what it takes to be able to bounce back from adversity.8 of his films that released that year where outstanding successes and he was the only artist that boasted of the highest amounts of outright hit cementing his status as a Box-office Legend.He was the Stand-out star of that year.The younger stars(Anil,jackie,Sunny, Govinda)could not even boast of 2 Hits to their credits,whereas Dharmendra gave 4 Super-hits (Hukumat,Aag hi Aag,Loha and Insaaniyat ke Dushman).Mithun at the time, had only Watan Ke rakhwale which incidentally featured none other than dharmendra(in a dynamic appearance) who was critical to the film's success.Even the Big B could not deliver a single hit that year.Hukumat went on to become the biggest hit of 1987 and even made twice the amount that the much hyped Mr India made.it was the first ever hit for director Anil Sharma.The film was celebrated at the 2003 Zee cine awards hosted by Anil Kappoor as one of the greatest hits of Indian cinema.The film is a winner all the way,it had great songs, powerful Dialogue delivery,excellent cinematography, and most importantly Dharmendra.This will surely rank as one of his best films ever.His mannerisms, anger, charisma, Machoism, Emotions,powerful delivery and ingenuity are all conveyed excellently in a full blend.His pairing with Rati is the icing on the cake.It was well received by the Indian audience.They are so convincing and fantastic together.The Brief duet picturised on them was exceptional.Sadashiv is a one-man treat and he is truly one of India's greatest villain.Watch this one for Dharmendra, Hindi cinema's Dynamic Maestro.\n",

            "Mujrim is an unauthorised remake of Scarface, but as a film, it is really quite good. Actually it's much better than one would imagine. It's not a scene-by-scene copy but rather takes major plot elements, which is not that bad. The film tells the story of Shankar, who spent years in prison since childhood for having killed his uncle, who tried to sell Shankar's mother for alcohol. Once released, he attempts to get his life the right path, but never gets the right opportunity, and given his poverty and his mother's state, gives up and becomes the right hand of an underworld don.Mujrim is a mainstream Hindi film in many ways, but it is very well adapted into its Indian setting. The film explores issues of poverty, crime, religion and faith, and it does so rather effectively through the character of Shankar, his headstrong and devoted mother, and his transition from the slums to becoming the head of the organisation where he started merely as an assistant. Some of the scenes are quite tough viewing, and as the film proceeds, we see our hero trapped in his own web of crime and misdemeanors.The is stereotypical in many ways, but it also emphasises values of friendship, respect for elders, loyalty, provides commentary on social stigma and shows the destructive repercussions of the world of crime. Its romantic portions are quite good. The characters are quite well written, particularly that of Yashoda, who never wavers from her faith and the strength of her convictions. Anu Malik's music is very good. The title track is quite sad and very situationally relevant within the film as it comes after the film's most harrowing pictures of poverty. \"Naiyo Jeena Tere Bina\" is beautiful both melodically and visually.Mithun Chakraborty, one of India's most talented and prolific actors, does a fantastic job as Shankar. His performance is both moving and believable. Madhuri Dixit, as his young leading lady, is gorgeous and absolutely charming. Her transformation throughout the film is done really well. Shakti Kapoor gets a serious role for once and does it well, the same is true of Sharat Saxena who is excellent as Sonia's father and Shankar's kind boss. Amrish Puri is brilliant as the main villain. Pallavi Joshi as Shankar's sister is very good, and Suresh Oberoi is okay as the police officer.The most brilliant performance in the film is undoubtedly and unsurprisingly that of Nutan. As Yashoda, she is unaffected by the film's faults and comes across as a very real woman with her realistic acting and natural presence. Her character's perseverance and steadfast determination to keep her faith and never lose her moral integrity is never hard to believe. Due credit goes to her - Nutan shines in this film, creating the perfect epitome of Indian simplicity and honesty. Her expressions are as always highly impressive. This is one of the last performances of one of the greatest actresses to have graced the Indian screen.Mujrim is a good film, much better than expected, and great entertainment all in all. The ending is excellent, and it's quite sad that some good films never gained notice mainly because they were released at a time when most other products were not up to the mark. This one is worth a watch, not for everyone, but fans of Mithun Chakraborty and his many films during the time should definitely give it a try.\n",

Even the songs are a pleasure to listen to.This movie was released in that phase of Indian Cinema when this genre was not as popular.

            "Movie : Ranbanka (U/A)Rating : 4/5Action genre is, I feel, the best genre, as there is hardly any dull moment and it's enjoyable to the core. Besides, if it attempts something different, then it's even better. Same happens with the Manish Paul starrer RANBANKA, which is not only a great film, but it also sets new opportunities for him. People were thinking that he fits only in comedy. I haven't seen his previous film MICKEY VIRUS till date but after watching RANBANKA, the respect for Manish Paul as an actor, and rather an action hero, has increased in my eyes and heart.RANBANKA has, to be honest, a simple storyline, but it doesn't mean it isn't good. The story and screenplay is truly crisp, wonderful and delightful. There's hardly a single dull moment. I had read a number of critic reviews, among which one compared it to the Varun Dhawan starrer BADLAPUR, which too was a good action film with a revenge theme. The reviews said that RANBANKA was no BADLAPUR, but I don't feel so. If you compare both, then in terms of storyline, you might find BADLAPUR a little better, but if you judge both films in terms of action and entertainment, then for sure RANBANKA packs quite a punch.The biggest thing I need to praise is the lead man : Manish Paul, the comic actor who has stepped out of his comfort zone, and has successfully delivered a powerful role as an angry man. If you don't believe, just watch the movie, and especially the fight scenes and of course, in the climax : you will be blown away for sure. I feel like continuing to praise him, as this kind of look and role suits him. It's just a beginning, I would like to see him in more action films, with such a rugged rebel like look. Pooja Thakur's role is more of a damsel but she plays well. Another major praise for Ravi Kishan, this seasoned actor makes you go wow and lol at sometimes. The other cast also does its respective parts well.Coming to the action, I would say I was rather \"blown away\" after seeing such excellent fights. Plus, thanks to the visual team, as well as Manish Paul, once again. The best fight is in the climax. You need to see it to believe it. The editing is a major plus point, as the editor seems to have done complete justice with the subject, and has cut the film with a crisp duration of 1 hour and 38 minutes. The dialogues are also worth praise. The cinematography of the film, along with beautiful locations and good visual effects also deserve special mention.However, on the flip side, I feel the music, especially the item song, could have easily avoided. Although item songs are common in such films, and that the film is not much long, yet it could gave been avoided. Still, the film is a good entertainer for all ages, and you need not to doubt such a powerful script and a super crisp screenplay. Kudos to director Aryeman for visualising something like this. I would surely buy its DVD once it releases. This film deserves to be in my video library.On the whole, RANBANKA is a solid action film, that is likely to work among action loving audiences, along with fans of Manish Paul, who would surely love him. You can of course watch this film. I am willing to watch it again. As I said previously, RANBANKA and BADLAPUR can't be compared, so don't keep in mind as if you are watching a BADLAPUR. Watch it not as a second BADLAPUR, but as the first RANBANKA. Strongly Recommended!\n",

            "Sanjay Dutt is a fabulous actor and not only his hits movies but his average and flops movies saw him in different types of roles. His performance from low budget to mainstream films have always been top notch. His cop films particularly were brilliant and this is one of his cop movies from the late 80s. This was also one of the few films where Dutt acts as the son of legendary actor Dilip Kumar. However, Bachchan's Shakti had a better demonstration of father vs son. Here the same thing is shown yet the clash between father and son seems forced. The main focus is on the villains and their activities and how Sanju swears to stop all their activities after one of his good friends die from the enemies. But, Dilip Kumar(his father in the movie) stops him in the nick of time and this leads into the father and son conflict. Sanju leaves his home and promises to come back after achieveing something and at the end he does come back. The movie is narrated well and even though it has the regular forced comedy and romance, the movie keeps you engaged. The action scenes are a delight, however there are a few cheesy stunts. Sanjay Dutt has done a brilliant job thought Dilip Kumar has done a better job and similar to Vidhaata, Sanju stays in the shadow of Dilip. However in my opinion, I like Sanju's angry young man type role and personally, I think he has done a brilliant job. Nutan is good, Madhuri Dixit is average and her only good film from the time was Tezaab. Direction by Sachine Bhomwick is good, can't believe the same guy wrote the script of the crap Akshay Kumar movie from 1994. On the whole, Kanoon Apna Apna is one of those cop films which had typical elements yet a damn good story with some excellent performances.\n",

            "Udhaar Ki Zindagi is a Hindi melodrama of its sort. It's a nice, albeit typical episode of a girl named Sita who comes from the US to India to visit her paternal grandfather, who has not been in contact with his son since the latter's marriage, which he disapproved of. Sita is determined to win her grandpa's heart and she ultimately does, but there the real conflict actually begins. The grandfather definitively wants to see his son but Sita does not find the courage to tell her aging grandparents that their son was actually killed in a car accident with his wife, as they would not be able to resist such shocking news. Udhaar Ki Zindagi is not a particularly convincing movie, it is flawed and overly sentimental, but it has its pluses too, the best thing about it being Kajol's presence. She is moving and convincing as the intensely tormented yet vivacious and strong Sita. Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee form a good screen couple like they used to do in their prime. Chatterjee still has a graceful screen presence. The film's music is okay, but one song that is particularly touching is \"Thodi Hansi\". The film's ending is bittersweet. Lovers of Hindi cinema and its melodramatic nature would certainly enjoy watching Udhaar Ki Zindagi, and I recommend it to Kajol fans mostly. I'm sure they will be interested to see the lady, who is regarded today as one of Hindi cinema's best actresses, in one of her first roles, which may not be particularly memorable but is played sincerely enough to be seen.\n",

A weekend party of intense emotions and high expectations leads to explosive bangs but with the sensitivity of people desperate to hold on to hope still preserved. A pleasant surprise. It dares to examine areas not talked about so as to preserve the tastes of the majority of people. A spotlight on emerging India and what it means to be at home in both worlds. Plus the hero and heroine make a very photogenic couple. It does sometimes have bumpy rides where it looks like the story is about to fall apart but it manages to pull itself together. Initially, I was watching it in Hindi until I realised that it was actually a dubbed movie. Everyone is actually speaking English with the occasional Hindi thrown in.\n",

            "Having left the cinema just after ten minutes of watching \"De Taali,\" which I must say I did not enjoy at all as it just didn't make any sense to me, I decided to watch this romantic comedy oldie from 1973 and it took me back to the times when as child I went to Bombay with my parents and had the opportunity to watch it for the first time in a cinema and feel the experience of watching it with an audience who would not hesitate to get up and dance to some good tunes as well as laugh out loudly to some jokes and funny scenes as well as get involved in fight scenes by showing their emotions. Of course in those days there were no multiplexes either and for a movie to be considered a \"hit\" it would have run successfully for over three weeks and over several weeks for it to be considered as a \"silver jubilee hit.\" A spoilt rich girl who lives with her uncle and aunt in the Himalayan town Simla, hires a man who she doesn't even know never mind having met before, in order to get her family inheritance which has been handed over to her uncle, who is ailing. The man informs her that he is from a poor family and that he will only do this for money. But she informs him that soon after they get married, she will divorce him and she will ensure that he receives his money. But soon events take a twist and she finds herself falling in love.Starring the late Sanjeev Kumar, Leena Chandvarkar (now Leena Ganguly, widow of the late Kishore Kumar), Nirupa Roy, Nazima, Manmohan and Krishnakant. This is directed by Raja Nawathe and is written by Krishan Chander and G.R. Kamath and is based on the novel by Satyendra Sharat, entitled \"Sayamber.\" Leena Chandwarkar just looked gorgeous and played her part very well as did the late Sanjeev Kumar. The songs, though just a few, were good and worth listening to as well. The comedy side of this movie  well what can I say? Except that the cast just made it look simple and effective. One particular song that still sticks in my mind is \"O Manchali Kaha Chali,\" sung by the late Kishore Kumar and the other being by the nightingale of India, Lata Manageshkar and the music by Laxmikant Pyarelal.Conclusion: If you enjoy old movies and in particular a romantic comedy, then this is the one to watch.\n",

            "Finished watching this one an hour back. And it was a pleasant surprise. Very realistic and hard hitting movie. The kind of movies that you get to see only in Sundance.I generally don't do reviews, but after watching this movie, I happened to come across a review in a large news paper. That review was very unfair review. Movie lovers should go and watch the movie and make your own opinion. Those big news papers run their own agenda- praising a movie so realistic and de-glamorized may have been difficult for them.First half is all about strong character buildup, 2nd half is crisp and takes the viewer on roller coaster ride. Music of the film is excellent with Jagjit Singh song Mrigtrishna placed perfectly at the right spot. Back background score is dark, and melts into the poignant scenes. Dialogues are meaningful researched and well thought, although i found something funny about the dialog \"To become a man, you have to learn two things, how to shoot a gun and how to use a condom\". Its funny in Hindi. A twisted Narrative keeps you engrossed. Censor Board went a step ahead by allowing the film to go ahead. There are some scenes, that need a strong heart. But, you know those are real because you hear about such events in news papers. Two surprising twists in the story keeps the viewers hooked. All in all its hard hitting, rustic film which viewers get to see rarely by Indian Filmmakers. Voice of Jagjit Singh singing the Song Mrigtrishna - his last song before he died, will make you miss him.\n",

            "The great showman of Bollywood Raj Kapoor had made a classic movie - Aawara (1951) containing an interesting and meaningful discussion about Nature vs. Nurture issue and the conclusion drawn was that nurture is more important in shaping the personality of an individual than nature or the jeans in his / her blood. I am in complete agreement with this conclusion. A child is like a lump of clay which is shaped by his / her nurture and the associated environment only in which he / she grows up. The role of his /her genes, if any, is minimal only.However around two and a half decades post Aawara, Raj Kapoor's elder son Randhir Kapoor directed a movie in which this argument was contradicted and it was established that jeans play a far greater role in shaping an individual than the fostering and environment. Well, I find it difficult to agree with that assertion. But I appreciate that the movie made by Randhir Kapoor under the prestigious banner of his father is definitely an entertaining movie which was a box office hit also. It's Dharam Karam (1975).Dharam Karam is the story of Shankar (Premnaath) who is a hoodlum and, therefore, better known as Shankar Daada. He is not at all happy with this form of his life and he wants his offspring to become a law-abiding, decent and honourable individual. He believes that it's possible only by his nurturing in a suitable environment and not his home and the milieu he is in. Hence when his wife gives birth to a baby boy, he switches him with a simultaneously born kid who is the child of a renowned artist Ashok (Raj Kapoor). Now Shankar's son Ranjeet (Narendranaath) grows up in Ashok's home and Ashok's son Dharam (Randhir Kapoor) grows up in a slum.Now as per the vision of the script-writer (Prayaagraaj) and the director (Randhir Kapoor himself), genes prove to be stronger than fostering and environment. Thereby despite growing up in a defective environment, Dharam does not become a baddie and despite growing up in a desirable environment, i.e., Ashok's home, Ranjeet takes the wrong path. Destiny brings all the characters of this story together and Shankar realizes his mistake in the climax when the children come to know who their real fathers are.Dharam Karam is a damn interesting movie. The narrative maintains its momentum from the very beginning to the very finish. If this movie is watched for sheer entertainment only, it's fine. However the thought propagated by it is dangerous. I don't know how Raj Kapoor allowed his son to make a movie turning his all time great classic Aawara upside down. A child arriving on the Earth has no control over the surroundings in which he is born. And hence blaming the genes in his blood for his taking the wrong path in life, is a sheer injustice to him. In fact, it's the quality of the nurture, the environment and the milieu which makes all the difference in development of his personality.Technically the movie is superior and lives up to the repute of the R.K. banner which is known as the first family of Bollywood. The screenplay is formula-based but able to maintain the curiosity of the spectator throughout. Writer Prayaagraaj has written the dialogs also which are not great. Considering the mood of the movie and the script, better dialogs should have been written.Randhir Kapoor was a good actor (at least in my opinion) but he was a better director who knew his job well. He has directed only three movies in his directorial career - 1. Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971), 2. Dharam Karam (1975) and 3. Henna (1991). And everyone of them has turned out to be a good movie. He has directed this movie also quite proficiently and extracted good performances from all the lead actors including himself as well as his legendary father. Rekha being his love interest in the movie didn't have much to do though.R.D. Burman's music is admirable. It contains two gems in the voice of Mukesh - 1. Ek Din Bik Jaayega Maati Ke Mol (this classic song elaborates a great philosophy of life), 2. Tere Humsafar Geet Hain Tere (sung by Mukesh with Asha Bhosle and Kishore Kumar). Other songs are average.I recommend Dharam Karam to all the entertainment-seekers but with my reservation about the theme of the movie. A seed may be good but if it does not get proper soil, water, manure and care; it cannot grow up into a stout tree. So much talent is wasted in India because the talented kids do not get the requisite nurture and desirable environment. They are the unfortunate buds which are not able to bloom into fragrant flowers and wither out before time.\n",

            "Following the footsteps of many stars of Bollywood, Vinod Khanna also decided to bring his next generation in Bollywood through a movie produced by him. His elder son - Rahul joined Bollywood on his own through offbeat cinema. But for his younger son - Akshaye, Vinod Khanna made a movie. This movie being the launchpad of Akshaye is Himalay Putra (1997). Barely 22 years old Akshaye had already been signed by J.P. Dutta for his ambitious project - Border (1997) but finally Himalay Putra proved to be his first release.Himalay Putra (the son of the Himalayas) starts with the love story of Suraj (Vinod Khanna) and Seema (Hema Malini) and the immortal wall of disparity of status standing between themselves and their union. Seema being the daughter of a rich businessman and Suraj being a police inspector with a modest income, are destined to face the objection of Seema's father (Amrish Puri) to their marriage. Amrish creates misunderstanding in Seema's heart for Suraj and she starts looking upon him as a greedy person who discarded her love for the sake of money. But the problem is that she has already got pregnant through him and after the demise of her father, she moves to the region of the Himalayas, giving birth to Abhay (Akshaye Khanna).Abhay grows up misunderstanding his father by learning her mother's version of the past events. He is a devotee of Lord Shiva and Seema, instead of telling him (and the world) about his father, prefers to call him as Himalay Putra (the son of the Himalayas). He falls in love with Esha (Anjala Zaveri) who is the daughter of their neighbour - Major Mathur (Satish Shah) but love is less important for him. What is more important for him is to locate his father and settle scores with him for his mother's sorrows.And then one day, he comes across him. Suraj has now become the Assistant Commissioner of Police and is on trail of a gang of smugglers headed by Rana (Danny Dengjongpa). He saves the life of Suraj and both come on good terms accordingly. When Abhay brings Suraj to his home and introduces him to his mother, both of his parents are stunned to see each other after a long time gap of two decades. However they prefer not to disclose their relationship to Abhay. But as the destiny has it, the activities of the smugglers' gang create such a situation that Abhay comes to know that Suraj only is his father. The movie ends with the removal of misunderstanding in the hearts of Seema and Abhay about Suraj and the happy union of all.The USP of this formula-studded regular potboiler is nothing else but the debutant hero - Akshaye Khanna. Akshaye is such a natural actor that he impressed the audience like anything in his very first screen appearance. Despite his tender years, he throws maturity from his looks in this movie and performed really well. He is able to conquer the hearts of the young females with his dashing personality and shows his mettle in handling action, comedy and sentiments with equal ease. This is the first movie of Anjala Zaveri too and she has filled the quota of the romantic female lead. However it's to be acknowledged that she is beautiful and the fresh pair looks quite charming.Seasoned actors Vinod Khanna and Hema Malini have left no stone unturned in creating a fall of sentiments on the screen. The script-writer has given them ample screen time too and they have taken the emotional quotient of this movie to desirable heights. Danny Dengjongpa is perfect as the traditional villain. Satish Shah has effectively presented good (and healthy) comedy through the jolly character of the ex-major of the Indian services.Director Pankaj Paarashar has handled the sentimental aspect of the story very well and therefore, the emotion-packed family drama is damn impressive. It's the crime-linked part of the story which is a letdown. The movie keeps the interest of the viewer alive throughout and does not bore. The romance between the very young pair of Akshaye and Anjala has also been presented in a good way. Clean comedy of Satish Shah provides relief moments whereas the intense drama of father, mother and son forms the major part of the movie.Anu Malik's music is good. Na Woh Inkaar Karti Hai No Woh Ikraar Karti Hai (sung by Udit Naarayan and Alka Yagnik) and penned by Nida Faazli) is the best song. Vinod Rathod's solo - I am a bachelor is also nice. Alka and Udit have also given their voices for Kaaga Sab Tan Khaaiyo (the initial lines of the lyric of Dev Kohli has been taken from the classic devotional song written by Baba Farid) which is also impressive and conveys the true love in the hearts of Seema and Suraj for each other despite their separation. Bam Bam Bhole, a devotional song for Lord Shiva, is also praiseworthy.Dharam Gulati's cinematography is very good. The beauty of the Himalayan region has virtually come alive on the screen.Farhan Akhtar is the assistant director of this movie. Perhaps he developed a good tuning with Akshaye during the making of this movie and that's why he was able to draw the best out of him in his own debut directorial venture - Dil Chaahta Hai (2001).Summing up, this confident debut of today's birthday boy Akshaye Khanna (born on 28.03.1975) is a decent one time watch. Though it was a box office flop (because the filmmaker could not maintain a proper balance in the script that came on the screen); containing good romance, good comedy, good songs and the prince charming Akshaye Khanna; this movie is recommended by me as an entertaining flick which will appeal more to the audience of emotional movies.\n",

            "This movie is definitely different from your typical Bollywood movies. For one, it doesnt have any songs. This movie is about a Police Inspector who unwillingly kills some disillusioned individuals in an encounter. The main story picks up after that. It is about the inspector's struggle to find information about the killed guys. Naseer as usual is a versatile actor. He plays the part of the Parsi-inspector in such an excellent fashion that you wonder why such movies are not made frequently but then when you hear that this movie did not do well in India, you understand why..(not enough mass appeal). I recommend this movie for anyone who doesnt mind watching a different movie which touches upon an important subject.\n",

            "Jabbar Patel has predominantly depicted political issues on the screen (with success too), but in UMBARTHA he doesn't only do that. While he has handled the issue of how the rehabilitation centres meant for desolate women are \"actually\" run (sex racket, money minting), he has also portrayed the sensitivities of a woman as a wife, a mother, as a member of her family, as a qualified social worker and as a head of the one of the many rehabilitation centres.The protagonist (Smita Patil) has excelled in portraying her character to perfection. Also the support cast, as is the case with almost all the Jabbar movies, has done a good job. Hrudaynath Mangeshkar has beautifully woven the lyrics of Vasant Bapat, Suresh Bhatt and Narendra Sharma into his music. Songs are used brilliantly to portray emotions - 'Chaand maatala..' has subtle undercurrents of the same-sex relationship between the two women of the rehabilitation centre, Smita Patil recollects the beautiful moments with her husband through 'Sunya sunya maifilit..', and equally good is the prayer song 'Gagan tejomay..', voices being rendered by Lata Mangeshkar and Ravindra Sathe.All in all, definitely a message-driven movie. A sure trigger to the thought process!\n",

Despite the film's low box office response, I like Teesra Kaun? a lot. I feel it was an entertaining film with a strong climax. This thriller has a good concept and as said before an edge of the seat end.Performance Wise: Mithun Chakraborty plays himself the Superstar. He plays to the gallery. Chunkey Pandey is good. Jaaved Jaffery's character is well written and well played to. Somy Ali is a never-ending beauty. She looks alluring and does a excellent job. Amol Palekar is superb. Sadashiv Amarpurkar shines. Tinu Anand and Avatar Gill are perfect. Satish Shah and Rakesh Bedi go slightly over the top. Ritupurna looks cute.All n all 'Teesra Kaun?' is a decent entertainer. For 1994 a Thumbs Up!\n",

            "Director Mr. Shailesh Verma fails to return the lost glory of this game. He is so desperate to make this film extraordinary that he has stuffed it with unnecessary shots, jerky expressions and unwanted sub plots. He has written the film too, so he has to be blamed. Major drawback of this film is that you didn't get any excitement while watching the game on screen. This is mainly due to bad camera angles and wrong and repetitive taking. Points are being increased in game but you won't be able to get why? Film based on sports need special shot division to make the soul alive but here makers thought that only keeping the game in script will make it interesting. Even, writing wise you feel that Kabaddi is forcefully incorporated. They don't have to explore or justify this game much so they kept a love angle which becomes triangle at a point. Complete film is in bits and pieces. Make up is also bad. They think that ageing only makes hair grey but skin texture remains same. Clothes do not go well with the characters economical status. Most of the time they look very fresh as if they are being used first time. Production value is very low. They had budget to create a Mela but required gathering was missing. You can feel the scarcity of crowd even in stadium scenes. Climax is good but again it losses it charm due to length. I am giving one more point only due to climax. Scenes are sometimes undercooked sometime overcooked. Performance wise, Annu Kapoor is a fine actor and he did impressive work in his limited scope. Main lead Nishan as Vijay look endearing and never goes overboard. Surprisingly #NitinJadhav as Khaleefa, the short guy in team is very good. He did well in comedy scenes as well in emotional one. Rest cast are just OK. Music is OK. Title track is good and supports the film well by pacing it up.\n",

It certainly gives it all with a vary of illustrious style which kinda remained me of the movie \"Flexing with Monty\". The direction and story both very good and I'll be looking forward to a Sudipto Chattopadhyay film for sure. A fine cast assembled. Lillete Dubey (Mary) one of the best performances in the movie. Maradona Rebello (Jerry) had to fill quite the shoes when portraying such a confound protagonist and does a commendable job doing so, the same could be said for his child counterpart, thanks to great make-up i suppose. Bipasha Basu the perfect peach to pick as the neurotic fantasy of Jerry. Amit Purohit and Sanjeeda Sheikh both were very truthful to their roles. Others add a good presences to the environment of it all. At the end of it all. This is one of those movies which isn't for anyone who get's baffled with convoluted plots or characters but for those who enjoy such a compendium would mostly love it. May be one day Pankh could be referred to as a cult classic.For those who are new to such a visual language, should just watch it with an open mind and for what it is. Don't make assumptions halfway through or you will be saying something like \"Did Bipasha Basu walk on the set straight out of a fashion show or something\".\n",

The chemistry between Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea, however, really elevate the movie's appeal. Bipasha's psychological state and what she has to go through are quite emotional. Her acting, in my opinion, is quite superb through the whole movie and in the final sequence. Although Bipasha's constant need for attention was annoying at times, I could see why it was necessary for the movie's plot of separated lovers. Dino Morea kept his emotional inside but when he was desperately in need of Bipasha he showed it. The dance sequences seem out of place and unnecessarily tacked on.

            "As a common viewer, I am always eager to watch debut films of newcomers to encourage them rightly, along with a greed to see something fresh or path breaking as a pleasant surprise. Now considering this very point, KARLE PYAAR KARLE surely had an edge over the others, since it was not only introducing two new actors playing the lead pair but was also directed by a debutant and was even providing the major break to a whole group of first timers both in the technical and acting department, showcasing a great vision of the producers.However I sincerely wish the vision was also supported by a good script and execution, as the film simply gives you nothing to praise in particular, apart from the honest efforts made by the newcomers, heavily relying on their first time director Rajesh Pandey. In fact such is the uninteresting progression of the film (featuring many weird or amateur scenes) that it straight away raises a question, that how the hugely experienced Suneel Darshan failed to judge all these mistakes watching its rushes and then didn't try to make some fair rectifications in time, even when it was the launching pad for his son, Shiv Darshan.The film fails to make any kind of impact from its first frame to the last and keeps walking on the same old, overused rotten formula of a love story without following any fresh approach or script. But what actually teases you the most is the inclusion of many strange sequences thrown in just in the beginning of the film itself, which readily spoil the mood and force you to check the names responsible for these silly segments right away. For instance, it opens with an amateur 'Roadies' inspired competition scene and then has a Police station act taken straight out of a Umar Sharif's comedy play from Pakistan. Next we see a College, wherein a young student is shamelessly dressed in an extremely vulgar costume, she further gives a sexy lap dance to the hero on the campus itself and there also exists a Fight Club in the college premises only where students can beat each other brutally without any kind of interference from the authorities. Later in the second half, again we have a weird kind of sequence with a black African and further the lead pair can also be seen dancing & kissing half naked in the waterfall, even after 110 minutes of the film just before the climax.In short, the writers try too hard to add enough twists & turns in the storyline which could be something if only its main plot was handled more sensitively. The film completely fails to make any kind of connect with the viewers because even though it is supposed to be a love story, one never finds any warmth, tenderness or passionate love in its more than two hours of duration to be precise. The DOP desperately tries to give it a grand look and so does the action director in the second half of the film, in vain. The soundtrack also doesn't have any great love songs which ideally need to be one of the major highlights of a love story introducing two new faces.Debutant Shiv Darshan's hard work is easily visible in the action and song sequences, but he still has a long road to travel in terms of dialogue delivery, emotions and dramatic scenes. Hasleen Kaur has a pretty face, but she mostly remains tensed in the film, which never allows her beauty to charm the viewers, as desired. All the other first timers in the supporting cast are just OK with no particular stand out act to be written about. And the director remains the first person to be blamed for such weak & carelessly made project, despite having a known producer and a strong setup to provide him all the required support.To sum it all, KARLE PYAAR KARLE is a kind of film which can easily cause depression to numerous deserving strugglers roaming in the city of dreams in search of their first break. Because after seeing these kinds of films only one begins to think that, 'Why was I also not born in a known filmy family?' or \"May be luck, background & financial factor plays a more important role in today's film world, in comparison to talent, hard work & passion!\"\n",

            "If you are a young man (even when you are not so young) and in a rainy night, you happen to see an extremely beautiful girl in a drenched condition, what will be the reaction on you ? Quite naturally, you will get romantic. And if you are an eligible bachelor, you may experience a storm in your heart which is sure to be much bigger than the storm being faced by you in the outer world that night.Barsaat Ki Raat (rainy night) is the story based upon such a rainy night only in which the hero, Bharat Bhooshan happens to see the heroine, Madhubala in a drenched state with her dress sticking to her body. Madhubala was so beautiful that she used to be referred to as the Venus of the Indian screen. Well, such an extra-ordinary beauty and that too in the drenched state in the rainy night, needless to say that heavens fell for the heart of our young hero. The story starts from this rainy stormy night of Hyderabad (coincidentally I am also at Hyderabad and it's raining too) and moves to Lucknow. The hero, Aman is a Qawwaal as well as a Shaayar (Urdu poet) and as was natural in that time; young, charming and emotional ladies used to fall for the touching poetry. So that sudden meeting under a shed in that rainy night changed the life of both the young Shaayar, Aman and the charming damsel, Shabnam who is the daughter of the police commissioner (K.N. Singh). The hiatus in the statuses becomes the insurmountable wall between the love-birds. Aman moves to Lucknow and keeps on participating in the Mushaayaras (gatherings of Urdu poets with the recitation of Urdu poetry). A lady Qawwaal, Shama (Shyama) has already fallen for him. So there's a love-triangle in the story. Finally, the story heads to Ajmer Shareef for its climax in which Aman defeats a renowned Qawwaal in a Qawwaali contest (Muqaabala-E-Qawwaali) and gets his sweetheart.This movie is based on the unique genre of music and poetry, Qawwaali which is not an easy one to perform for even the seasoned and expert singers. In this movie, the hero is not only an Urdu poet and singer, he is portrayed as an expert in creating extempore poetry for his Qawwaalis while the contest or the Muqaabla is in progress. The lyricist of this movies' songs, the great Shaayar Sahir Ludhiyanvi and the music director, Roshan both have done an outstanding job in creating memorable Qawwaalis (and normal songs too) for the story of the movie. Seasoned singers like Manna Dey, Rafi, Batish, Shankar-Shambhu, Balbir, Lata, Asha, Suman Kalyanpur, Sudha Malhotra, Kamal Barot have given their voices for the Qawwaalis and the songs. In fact, it's the extra-ordinary music of this movie which has made it immortal.All the songs are real gems. It boasts of classic Qawwaalis like Na To Kaarvaan Ki Talash Hai (which includes Ye Ishq Ishq Hai Ishq Ishq), Jee Chaahta Hai Choom Loon, Nigaah-E-Naaz Ke Maaron Ka Haal Kya Hoga etc. In addition to them, memorable songs like - Zindagi Bhar Nahin Bhoolegi Woh Barsaat Ki Raat, Garjat Barsat Saawan Aayo Re, Maine Shaayad Tumhen Pehle Bhi Kahin Dekha Hai, Mujhe Mil Gaya Bahaana Teri Deed Ka, Maayus To Hoon Vaade Se Tere etc. are all a grand treat for the genuine music lovers. Listening to these songs take the music-lover to a different enchanting world, where he / she loses the sense of the outer world and just lost in the in the melody and the Shaayari drenched with sentiments.The movie is otherwise also very interesting. Director P.L. Santoshi has ably directed this unusual story. Curiosity has been maintained well for the viewer. Art direction and cinematography are A class. The Muslim environment in the cities of Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer in the fifties has been exasperated in an admirable manner. Production value is high. Editing is also good.Performances are quite good. Bharat Bhoosan was a specialist in the roles of artists (Shaayar, poet, singer, painter etc.) and he has done well in this movie too. The Indian Venus, Madhubala is a treat to watch. She has performed well too. K.N. Singh as the stern police commissioner, Shyama as Shama, Ratna (playing her younger sister, Shabaab) and all others have supported the main cast quite proficiently. Ratna's performances as Shabaab deserves special mention.This black and white movie is an evergreen classic and the only movie based on timeless Qawwaalis. Such movies are hard to find in today's times. So watch it and get nostalgic once again.\n",

            "The finest Hindi Film I have ever seen, which inspires people of all ages even today, though the film is produced with essentially children in mind. Its songs are particularly touching and elevating. They remind people of all ages and teach the young the history and beauty of India, its monuments, valour and sacrifices made by Indians through generations, the reverence India holds for her sacred rivers, and describes Gandhiji, through moving, melodious, and absorbing lyrics, and music, while on a journey on a train and through travels around India. The film highlights the basic cultural ethos of India, in which the young pay respects to their teachers and elders and love for others, while the teacher becomes a beackon of hope, and everlasting friendships. It teaches children to be brave in the face of hardships, and brings out the rejuvenating effect of Indian music, to motivate children towards patriotism and noble acts towards each other. A really fine movie to see by the whole family, and excellent aid for display in schools. It should become part of school curriculum in India, in all schools.\n",

            "I went into this expecting a bad movie, you could say I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.Now I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.If you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch it to see if it is as bad as the guy on the IMDb said it was. This movie should only be shown to criminals in jail as further punishment for their crimes.\n",

            "It is poetic justice that, among all his alleged sins, Sanjay Gandhi finds himself behind bars for a case that has aroused the least public interest. Sanjay, along with Indira Gandhi's former information and broadcasting (I&B) minister V.C. Shukla, is facing trial for allegedly destroying the prints of a Hindi feature film Kissa Kursi Ka (KKK), produced by Janata Party mp, Amrit Nahata. Most people are under the mistaken impression that Sanjay's alleged destruction of the KKK prints is a relatively minor offence. However, if convicted, both Sanjay and Shukla are liable to a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. In KKK, the main political party had a \"people's car\" as its election symbol-an obvious take-off on Sanjay's dubious Maruti car project. KKK also lampooned his prominent supporters like Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari, Indira Gandhi's private secretary R.K. Dhawan, and the Emergency femme fatal Rukhsana Sulktana of Turkman Gate fame. KKK was sent to a seven-member revising committee by the Censor Board and further on to the Central Government by the committee. The I&B ministry sent Nahata a show cause notice which listed a total of 51 objections to his film. Nahata subsequently claimed that the objections were 'frivolous' and 'absurd' and on July 11, 1975 submitted a reply to the objections claiming that the characters in KKK were \"imaginary and do not refer to any political party or persons\". However, the fate of Nahata's film had been sealed at a secret coordination committee meeting held on July 7 chaired by Shukla. The prosecution has alleged that during the meeting, Shukla ordered that the film, including the original negatives, be seized. http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20061218/stories.html The film's ban signalled the beginning of the end of Sanjay Gandhi's reign.The Shabana Azmi starrer was India's first political spoof and its title-Kissa Kursi Ka (KKK)-has become part of the political lexicon. With dialogues like \"Sir, give this young man the licence to manufacture small cars because he learnt it in his mother's womb\", it took on the most powerful man of India then, Sanjay Gandhi. In the film, the main political party had a 'people's car' as its election symbol, an obvious take-off on Sanjay's Maruti car project. Obviously Indira Gandhi's errant son, then leading an unbridled youth brigade, known as Sanjay Gandhi's storm-troopers, was not amused. The film's negative, all the prints and the master-print were lifted from CBFC office, brought to the Maruti factory in Gurgaon and burned. The film, however, gave a powerful handle to the Jayaprakash Narayan-led movement and later to the Janata Party in destroying the Indira Gandhiled Congress in the 1977 Lok Sabha polls. The Shah Commission, set up to examine the Emergency excesses, held Sanjay guilty for burning the prints. As the Supreme Court denied him bail, Sanjay had to spend a month in Tihar Jail. V.C Shukla, I&B minister in Indira Gandhi's cabinet, also faced trial for allegedly destroying the prints of KKK and was jailed for two years. The verdict was overturned later. Though very few could see the film directed by Amrit Nahata, its title became immortal. During the anti-Emergency campaign, Nahata, a former Congress MP from Rajasthan, had been catapulted to stardom. He made the film again in 1978 with a new cast. Despite the controversy and massive publicity, the new movie proved to be a disaster. Even his commercially-oriented decision to replace Azmi with busty calendar girl Katy Mirza could not save the film.In a letter to the then I&B minister L.K. Advani, Nahata demanded Rs 1 crore as compensation claiming that \"were KKK released even now, it would have broken all box office records\".Prior to KKK, Nahata had made a devotional movie Sant Gyaneshwar in 1965 and a crime thriller Raton Ka Raja in 1967. He died on April 26, 2001, aged 74. He did not stand for Parliament or make a film again.\n",

            "Rebecca is a classic mystery penned by Daphne du Maurier in 1938, which was adapted for celluloid by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940. The lady in the title role is already dead in the story but she, through her memories, the references to her in people's talks and her belongings left behind, continues to haunt the life of the new wife of her husband. It's a great psychological mystery whose climax was changed in the movie by the director, Alfred Hitchcock to suit the mentality of the American audience those days.The great singer-musician of Indian cinema, Hemant Kumar adapted this story for a Hindi movie - Kohra (mist) in 1964, taking Biswajeet in the male lead, i.e., as the dead woman's husband and Waheeda Rehman in the central role of the hero's wife. Interestingly, despite the story revolving around the memories of the dead lady (called Poonam in the movie), the director has not shown her face despite several flash backs. He has allowed the audience to see either her body starting from the neck (in the front pose) or see herself from the back side. And that's the reason, I don't know which actress played this character who is the soul of the story.In this Indianized version of Rebecca, widower Raja Amit Kumar Singh (Biswajeet) marries Rajeshwari (Waheeda Rehman) who enters his mansion with a lot of hope for her joyful future only to be stunned by the high-handed attitude of Daai Maa (Lalita Pawar) who looks upon her derogatorily and always compares her with Poonam, the deceased wife of her husband. By misguiding her to wear the attires of Poonam and imitating her mannerisms, Daai Maa brings about a rift in her relationship with her husband too. But one fine morning, the dead body of Poonam is found and Raja Amit Kumar Singh is arrested under the charge of her murder. Gradually the inner secrets of Poonam's life come to the fore. The ultimate truth is revealed in the climax taking place in the court-room.Director Biren Naag has quite skilfully adapted the classic story of Rebecca for this Indianized story and changed the climax once again (firstly it was changed by Alfred Hitchcock in the Hollywood movie - Rebecca) which suits the taste of the Indian audience. The drama takes some time to pick-up but it is quite speedy in the later part and keeps the audience spellbound.Gorgeous and talented Waheeda Rehman is the main attraction of this black and white movie. She impresses in all kinds of scenes - romantic, emotional and painful. Biswajeet is okay in the male lead. The supporting cast has done its part well. However the best performer is definitely Lalita Pawar in the role of Daai Maa (a role akin to the role of Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca). It is definitely one of her best performances. I will be highly grateful if somebody can tell me the name of the actress who played the role of Poonam (or Rebecca if we refer to the original story) because her face is never revealed in the movie.Music is, in fact, the biggest strength of this classic suspense-thriller. Producer of this movie, Hemant Kumar has composed as well as sung the songs which include gems like - Ye Nayan Dare Dare and Raah Bani Khud Manzil. The movie contains Lata's classic songs like - Jhoom Jhoom Dhalti Raat and O Beqaraar Dil as well. Asha-Mahendra Kapoor duet - Kaahe Bajaai Tune is also in this movie. The beautiful lyrics have been dropped by the pen of Kaifi Aazmi.Cinematography, art-direction, editing and production value aspects of this black and white movie are all up to the mark. The movie proves to be a memorable experience for the viewer after it is over.Those who have not read (or seen) Rebecca, should not miss this classic Bollywood mystery. However, those who have read the novel or seen the Hollywood movie, will also find it quite engrossing and entertaining. And it's a very big treat for the fans of Waheeda.\n",

Meenakshi is a talented actress and this role doesn't demand much of her, she does well. Reena Roy does a decent job as well . This movie was a comeback for Reena Roy after three years, she had put on weight but shows her talent. Yet, her character wasn't all that convincing. For example her aunt who keeps trying to get her way keeps trying to brainwash Reena Roy and plant a seed of doubt about Govinda and Meenkashi. Reena Roy ignores but then starts to believe in her aunt because she was hurt when she suggests to Govinda about money for the temple and he suggest it better off going to the children's education.It needed a better reason for the aunt to start her mind games with Reena Roy. The woman who plays Reena Roy's aunt is o.k. It would have been better off Aruna Irani, Lalit Powar or Shashikala doing this role.Overall, not a bad family movie. I like it and would suggests it being watched on a weekend when you have nothing better to do.\n",

            "There is a good message lying somewhere underneath this comedy drama that went without noticed in the cinemas.An aspiring writer (Pathak) moves out of his house due to frustration from his constantly nagging and gloriously miscast wife (Godse) and ends up in the arms of a hot call girl (Sen). The message that the film tries to convey is about the publishing industry, which is heavily characterized by pulp and porn fiction rather than pure literature. And our protagonist is out here to change that. The terrible cast performance, even from cinema thespians like Saurabh Shukla and Pathak, wreaks havoc with the whole film. Godse, however, wins the competition of being the worst actor.There are jokes here and there if you notice, but most of the narration, which is told in a non-linear fashion, is plain monotonous with random songs. I am often enthralled by the sheer craftiness of low- budget films, but in here the inferior production setup comes out like a sore thumb and manages to sabotage the whole broth, which is under-cooked in the first place.BOTTOM LINE: Other than Pathak's interesting character, Chaudhary's Kaagaz Ke Fools is a below average show. Can skip.GRADE: D-Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n",

            "Yash Chopra during the 70s made films like Deewaar,Trishul and in between he made romantic films like Kabhie Kabhie which was a big hit, Doosra Aadmi was his production directed by Ramesh Talwar. The film had a different theme(for Hindi films),it is based on the Hollywood movie - Goodbye Again (1961) which is a celluloid adaptation of Francois Sagan's bestselling novel - 'Aimez-vous Brahms ?' The film has a concept which was not accepted that time of a lady falling for a younger guy because he resembles her previous love. The film starts with routine love story and then transforms into a mature one and is well handled, no doubt, we also have comedy in between by Deven Verma. It ends on a predictable note though but perhaps the director thought it's smart considering the theme being bold.Direction is good Music by Rajesh Roshan was superb, Chal Kahin Door is a superb song sung by Kishore,Lata and Rafi, rest songs by Kishore and Lata are superb too.Rishi Kapoor is superb in his role, Neetu Singh is admirable too in her role, both were dating that time and it shows in their chemistry. Shashi who is real life uncle of Rishi suits the role and impresses in a cameo, Raakhee is superb in her role too Parikshit Sahni is good, Satyen Kapoo is as always good, Deven verma entertainsYears later in 2001 there was a movie Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya which had Govinda and his nephew Vinay Anand in a remake of this film which too bombed.\n",

            "Juhi Chawla, a talented actress in her own right, is the sole protagonist in this stereotypical and melodramatic fare. This is one of several terrible, thankless roles she got to play around that time - the self-sacrificing, demure, purer-than-the-driven-snow kind of girl. Her father hates her because he lost his wife who died at Juhi's childbirth and genuinely believes she is the sole reason behind every trouble that befell his family. We, the audience, realise right from the beginning what her father fails to understand - that her presence actually brought luck to the family. This motif in the film shows an amusingly distorted and prejudiced mindset through which the film rejects one superstition by invariably reinforcing another.I know, it's just a film, a fairytale-like story, but it's not just a film actually because it genuinely reflects an incredibly enraging mentality where everything is put on the slim shoulders of our heroine be it good or bad, and it is characteristic of so many films of the time. Interestingly, had it been taken seriously, it could have been a fascinating commentary on, say, the treatment of women in view of superstitious beliefs in conservative societies like the one depicted in the movie. The concept actually reminds one of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's classic Anupama, except it's much more melodramatic, much less credible and smart, and generally not kind to the lead character or the viewers.

            "Rajesh Khanna was a romantic hero and hence most of the movies made by riding on his popularity were scripted as romantic movies. Whatever might have been the story idea, the screenplay gave a lot of emphasis to romance between Rajesh Khann and his heroine. Mehboob Ki Mehndi (the henna applied to the hands of a lady which is meant for her lover) is one such movie only.The story of Mehboob Ki Mehndi has a Muslim milieu containing Muslim characters. The plot is based on the character of an erstwhile Nawaab(Muslim ruler of an erstwhile princely state in India) but now impoverished Anwar Kamaal(Pradeep Kumar) who wants to settle an old score with Nawaab Safdarjung(Inftekhaar). He approaches the house of Safdarjung in order to kill him and his son Yusuf(Rajesh Khanna) but is not able to do so and waiting for a suitable opportunity to do so in future, he accepts to serve in his household under the fake name of Khairuddin. However gradually the good behaviour and respect rendered to him by Yusuf makes his killing job difficult with the passage of time. On the other hand, Yusuf falls in love with Shabaana(Leena Chandavarkar) who is the tutor of his nephew. Love blossoms in the heart of Shabaana too and their courtship heads towards the desired destination of wedding. However there is a secret about Shabaana not known to Yusuf and his family that she is the daughter of a courtesan with nothing known about her father. However a strange emotional bond gets developed between aged Khairuddin and orphan Shabaana. In the climax, the secrets buried in the past of Shabaana as well as those pertaining to the identity of Khairuddin no longer remain the secrets once a killing takes place and everything is set right after an interesting courtroom drama. As said earlier, Rajesh Khanna starrers during that period focused on romance more than anything else. Following that tradition, Mehboob Ki Mehndi also focuses on romance only which, like all the hit movies of Rajesh Khanna, is ably supported by melodious songs. The romance is bound to be dignified as the characters of the movie are Muslim characters and the milieu is traditional Muslim milieu soaked in the famous Muslim culture (Tehzeeb). It's delicate and touching as well.The movie, written by Anjana Rawail and directed by Harnaam Singh Rawail, is very interesting right from the opening scene to the culminating scene. The sentimental and social parts of the plot have been beautifully amalgamated with the romantic part. Except the desirable interruption of melodious songs and undesirable interruption of the prolonged comedy track (which was perhaps a necessary evil for Hindi movies in those times), the narrative flows very well and heads towards its conclusion which is though a forgone one(considering that it's formula-based regular Bollywood movie) but the curiosity of the audience as to how it will be arrived at, is kept alive throughout.Technically the movie is sound. The art director and the dress designer have kept the Muslim background of the story in mind while doing their respective jobs. And they alongwith the cinematographer, have done very well. Most of the scenes are very beautiful and eye-soothing. Background score and editing are also okay. The only irksome thing is the lengthy comedy track which, if done away with, would have made the movie crispier and better.Laxmikant Pyarelaal's music with the lyrics of Anand Bakshi is a big highlight of the movie. Which Indian cine music lover has not heard Lata Mangeshkar's classic number - Jaane Kyun Log Mohabbat Kiya Karte Hain ? Alongwith that the album of Mehboob Ki Mehndi contains melodious songs like Ye Jo Chilman Hai Dushman Hai Hamaari, Mere Deewaanepan Ki Bhi Sada Nahin, Pasand Aa Gayi Hai Ek Kaafir Haseena, Itna To Yaad Hai Mujhe Ki Unse Mulaqaat Hui, Apna Hai Tu Begaana Nahin and of course, the title track in the enchanting voices of Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Hemlata.Rajesh Khanna is at his romantic best in the movie. He is present here with all the gimmick and mannerism he was famous for. Beautiful Leena Chandavarkar has created good on screen chemistry with him and performed the emotional aspect of her assigned role also very well. Seasoned actor Pradeep Kumar is the best actor in this movie. All others are also well in place.This interesting movie has a repeat value and can be seen by multiple times by the lovers of romantic flicks.\n",

            "This film is really really bad. But there is one thing that made it look better than it would have and it is Rekha. Not that it's her best or one of her best performances, but there's something very amusing about the fun she apparently has in making this stupid film and on the other hand the seriousness with which she takes her character.37 year-old Rekha plays in this film a young teacher who gets married to a policeman played by the ever-annoying Rajnikanth. Soon enough she is raped in front of her tied husband and her husband is killed when he tries to defend her. This is followed by her decision to become a policewoman herself. All of a sudden, this fragile woman becomes a fighter who breathes fire and is able to wrestle anyone, just like a typical Bollywood hero.Rekha's character had that transformation from a shy woman to a brave, strong madame who seeks revenge, which is similar to her character in the great Khoon Bhari Maang. But while the latter is a great, much more engaging and intense thriller, this one is a cheap, unrealistic film with unbelievably terrible dialogues, dreadful acting (except Rekha of course) and action scenes which are just pure fantasy geared to kids.Only in Bollywood can we see a film classified as drama which is actually science fiction. It's however such a fun watching Rekha fighting, it was so laughable that a woman can fight over 40 men and remain complete, without a pimple.Rajnikanth is a terrible actor (can he be called an actor? I don't know) and I was so happy that one hour into the film his character died. It was a great relief and I consider it one of the high-points of this film. From then on the film centers on Rekha, who tries to do the best of what she is given. That's what makes her a great actor. She delivers her dialogues in a great and convincing way. Alok Nath, a great character actor, is weak and unimpressive.There is also something very depressing about the main idea of the film: the law is dumb. No matter what you do, how much you try to prove someone's innocence or someone's fault, the innocent will turn out guilty and the criminal -- innocent. Every politician is corrupted, every policeman prefers money to honesty. I can't understand why certain filmmakers try to portray the law in such a way.Don't watch this film unless you are a big Rekha fan. (4/10 - only for Rekha).\n",

The movie has been missing for years, but thanks to good old Grapevine, it has now surfaced in its 1928 feature film cutdown version. Although this feature now runs only 60 minutes, I feel sure this glimpse will more than satisfy all Tarzan addicts. Alas, however, it will never be regarded as a long-lost \"classic\" again. Elmo Lincoln's performance as Tarzan is so bad and so off-centre, it has to be seen to be believed. Admittedly, he is hampered by a really weird, mind-boggling costume (which has been somewhat retouched for the poster so that it doesn't look half as ridiculous). His performance is best described as indifferent. Directors Robert F. Hill and Scott Sidney don't seem to be giving him any dramatic direction at all. In fact, it's a mystery what Hill and Sidney were doing. The other players are less clownish than Elmo Lincoln, but no-one would describe their contributions as good or even adequate. The camera-work is - to say the least - primitive. It doesn't budge one inch. Admittedly, the original tints - mostly green - have been preserved, but even this spectacle wears thin after 20 minutes or so. In all, \"Adventures of Tarzan\" is no long-lost masterpiece after all. It was just long-lost. I'm sure many disappointed viewers will feel it should have stayed that way!\n",

Quite naturally, he will leave no stone unturned in defending her in the court and get her exonerated. And that's the story of this black and white suspense-thriller starring Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman which was released in 1962.Baat Ek Raat Ki (the tale of a night) starts quite interestingly with the murder of a stage actor, Ranjan (Chandrashekhar) at the residence of Neela (Waheeda Rehman) in the darkness of the night. Before the titles start, it is shown that just after the sound of the gunshot, someone comes out of the house and while running in the dark, he collides with a blind beggar. Anyway, Neela who is a renowned stage actress, is arrested for the murder and she confesses it too. But when she being in police custody, tries to commit suicide, our hero, Rajesh (Dev Anand) arrives on the scene and saves her life. While registering his statement in this regard in the police station the next morning, Rajesh who is a criminal lawyer, happens to meet Neela's wailing mother and through her comes to know of Neela's turning into a renowned stage actress from an ordinary girl, dancing in public to earn a living for herself and her family members.He gets Neela released from the police custody on his responsibility under the pretext of the doctor's advice (to improve her mental condition) but actually for digging out the whole background of the murder from the horse's mouth itself and thus helping the police in preparing a solid case against her in the court. However he falls in love with the extremely beautiful damsel. Then starts his bid to prove her innocence and get her exonerated and finally he succeeds in exposing the real murderer.Director Shankar Mukherjee has directed this movie ably and presented a good mix of romance, emotions and drama in this murder mystery. Despite its flaws, it provides a nice entertainment to the viewer. Though the viewer can guess who the murderer is, still his curiosity is not diluted and that's the success of the screenplay writer and the director. The final court-room scene in which both the murderer as well as Dev Anand are in disguise, is highly interesting. Though normally disguises in Indian movies are so poor that the audience can easily identify the character behind the disguise, yet this movie is an exception in this regard.Technically and cinematographically this B &W movie is all right. However editing is not up to the mark. Perhaps the length of the movie has been decided to follow the relevant norm in that period, else it could have been trimmed very easily by at least 15-20 minutes.I consider Waheeda Rehman as one of the greatest actresses of the Indian silver screen. And in this movie too, she has portrayed the loneliness and stuffiness of the girl going from rags to riches, with a high degree of proficiency. She is in double role too (playing Neela's younger sister). Though she's said to be very close to Guru Dutt in personal and professional life, in my opinion, her best on-screen chemistry was with Dev Anand, the stylish, dashing and mannerismic Indian Gregory Pack. He has also done satisfactorily. The supporting cast is OK. Johnny Walker has done good comedy.S.D. Burman has done admirable music in the movie with the lyrics being written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The best song is inarguably - Na Tum Hamen Jaano Na Hum Tumhen Jaanein sung separately by Hemant Kumar and Suman Kalyanpur. Other songs - Akela Hoon Main Iss Duniya Mein Koi Saathi Hai To Mera Saaya (Rafi), Jo Hain Deewane Pyar Ke (Rafi-Asha), Jo Ijaazat Ho To Ek Baat Kahoon (Rafi-Asha), Sheeshe Ka Ho Ya Patthar Ka Dil (Rafi-Lata), Arre Kisne Chilman Se Mara (Manna Dey) etc. are also quite good to listen.Baat Ek Raat Ki is not an excellent movie. However it is definitely a nice timepass. Whether you are a mystery fan or fond of a social drama or like romantic musicals, Baat Ek Raat Ki will live up to your expectation.\n",

            "This movie has some evergreen songs namely \"Sau saal pehle\", \"Jiya O Jiya\", \"Teri zulfon se\", \" Uff Yuma.\" Also it made a superstar of its young heroine Asha Parekh, who remained one of the top actresses of the 60s throughout. She is very believable as the lovely Nisha. Also Dev Anand and she made a great on screen couple. By the time this movie was being made, a lot of mannerisms were already being associated with Dev Anand. However, in this movie they look natural. His portrayal of Sunder is fantastic, amusement at her indignation that he calls her \"Gaowali\" (villager), love at her child like innocence and suppressed rage at her unexpected betrayal. Wish they did more movies together other than just Mahal.\n",

            "Paresh Rawal starrer release of this year - Oh My God has drawn a lot of praise. Based on his own Gujarati play, this movie attacks on the exploitation of people's religious sentiments by the high profile 'contractors of religion' spread in all the nooks and corners of India. Started with the question whether God exists or not, it ended with emergence of faith in God in the heart of the protagonist. I liked this movie very much just like its other admirers but found weaknesses also in the script and its treatment. Anyway, this movie reminded me of a three and a half decades old Hindi movie which was made on the same theme albeit its script was entirely different from that of OMG. It's Yehi Hai Zindagi (1977).Yehi Hai Zindagi (this only is life) is the story of Anand (Sanjeev Kumar) who is an atheist but the husband of a religious lady - Gaayatri (Seema Deo). He has two sons - Madhu (Romesh Sharma) and Govind (Aadil) and a daughter - Kamla (Tamanna). In the given situation of his life, he is able to afford only a very modest lower middle class living for himself and his family. His disbelief in God regularly leads to his arguments with his wife. One day he decides to grow in the line of business and takes money out of the sacred money accumulated and kept for religious purposes only by by his religious wife, i.e., Gaayatri. Gaayatri prohibits him from taking God's money but he does not listen and promises to return this 'loan' taken from God in due course of time. With the help of that money, he keeps on going forward in the line of business and progresses by leaps and bound due to his hard work and dedication towards his mission (to become rich). And finally, the day comes when he is no longer a modestly living ordinary person and has become very rich now. Meantime his elder son gets married to the daughter (Neeta Mehta) of his business partner (Utpal Dutt) and apparently everything seems to be perfectly placed in his life. However gradually he is able to see that the landscape of his life is not as greenish as he perceives it. There are many wrong things which have been out of his knowledge. Since the day he had taken 'God's money' as a 'loan' for his business endeavours, Lord Krishna (Vikram Gokhle) has been visiting him quite regularly (visible to him only and to none else). Lord Krishna does not try to force him to believe in the power of God but keeps on reminding him that money isn't everything in the world and he should take proper care of his own life as well as his family also simultaneously with his business work. Anand realizes this lesson after losing a lot in his life including his peace of mind and then he bows before the Supreme Power.The script of this movie is entirely different from that of OMG but the basic theme is more or less the same. However I keep this movie a notch above OMG because the it raises the question which I have raised on several occasions in my own life since the very childhood - What's more important - having faith in God and worshipping Him or having faith in ethics and following them ? Mahatma Gandhi asserted - Satya Hee Eeshwar Hai (Truth only is God) and I firmly believe in that only. The hero of Yehi Hai Zindagi is an atheist and does not believe in God or His power but he is a truthful person who just gets lost in the race of making money, ignoring his life as well as his family members and finally suffers due to that. In OMG, whatever the protagonist asserts in the court and outside the court is quite true and all of his arguments are valid but he is not shown in the movie to make an honest living. He tells lies to his customers and always tries to exploit their devotion and religious beliefs to own monetary advantage. Hence in my view, he cannot blame the Almighty for everything that happened to him when he himself was not honest in his dealings. He files a suit against God in the court because the insurance company refuses to pay him the insured sum due to the loss being through an act of God but it is also shown that despite being an experienced businessman, he had not bothered to read the terms and conditions of the policy before taking it. Then who's fault is it - God's or his own ? The way Paresh Rawal is an outstanding actor, the same way (late) Sanjeev Kumar was an extra-ordinary actor The story revolves around him (and Lord Krishna) only and all others are in supporting roles. Vikram Gokhle as Lord Krishna has also performed wonderfully and the on-screen chemistry of these two is no less than that of Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar in OMG. The complete supporting cast has done justice to the assigned roles.Since Oh My God has earned a lot of success and critical acclaim, I suggest the viewers who liked it, to watch Yehi Hai Zindagi also and contrast these two movies. I put my question again - what's more important - faith in Him or faith in ethics and noble values of life ?\n",

            "1993 flick 'Phool Aur Angaar' is one of the finest films to come out of Bollywood. An awesome film. The script is great, the performances are top-notch and amazing songs, make this film a power-packed entertainer. The film was a Blockbuster at the box office, and It deserved to be. Songs: Chori Chori Dil Tera and Hum Teri Mahobbat Mein are amazing. Mujhko Peena Hai and the title are track are also great. One of Anu Malik's finest works as a music director.Performances: Mithun Chakraborty is a Legendary actor, my all-time favorite actor, His performance here is fantastic. He plays the teacher naturally, but leaves you speechless as the cold-blooded killer. Shantipriya looks very beautiful and does a decent job. Prem Chopra excels, especially when he delivers his line 'Natwar Naam Hai Mera, Pyar Se Log Mujhe NAUGHTY' Khete Hain. Gulshan Grover is excellent. Arjun causes hatred. Monish Bhel, Asrani, Raza Murad and others are good. Late actors Lakshmikant and the actor who plays the conniving cop are good.'Phool Aur Angaar' is a memorable watch. Two Big Thumbs Up!\n",

            "-it is notoriously tough to adapt a great book into a fabulous script but for once this is fluidly established by a gifted script writer and embellished with a truly dignified performance by the female lead-Hema Malini who plays a widow who after her husband's gruesome murder is obliged to marry his younger brother according to the religious tradition.the sensitive story is subtly executed with intelligence rather then melodrama and the supporting cast is just as good ,yet the soul of the movie lies in the pragmatic ,bereaving widow who has to take a tough decision and that is where the strength of the story lies as she is torn between the past and future but has to act to save her children's present ,a classic book made into a sensitive drama that will haunt you for a long time after it has ended ,the songs are kept to a minimal and there are no clichés as in mainstream Bollywood movies ,i am sure the Rajinder Singh Bedi will be very pleased with this marvellous adaptation which does full justice to his literary classic.this is a movie for people with a taste for the unusual and deserves a special distinction by all criterion .a culturally correct setting enhances it's authenticity as it portrays rural India with painstaking details and the art direction and cinematography capture the picturesque fields as fluidly as the subtle expressions on the faces of its ensemble cast .a must see for the connoisseurs .ultimately it is a tribute to the matriarchal spirit of the great Indian womanhood and a triumph for the female -oriented intelligent cinema ,Rishi Kapoor brings a passive frustration to the role of the younger man who has to accept the older woman as his wife ,but the transformation is subtle and the quiet acceptance by the children of their father's role by their uncle is very tasteful yet truly heart-rending at times ,but this is a movie which shows the ugly side of life which describes the truth of compromises and the facts are rather bitter ,which might explain the failure of this classic commercially in India . the controversial nature of the religious tradition might be blamed but the fact it is widely practised for the pragmatic side of the convenience to preserve the familial structure cannot be denied . Poonam Dhillon played the tragic girl who has to give up her first love as he is now bound to a woman she had adored secretly as a mother figure ,the complexities here are phenomenal but the director is gifted indeed and he is able to make great cinema out of great literature . it is sad that this movie missed out on tax exemption as well as national awards as no other work of art is more deserving of those rewards then this gem cultural representation which is almost revolutionary in concept and execution .\n",

            "Kab ? Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan ? (1970) is a suspense-thriller as suggested by the title (When ? Why ? And Where ?) which stars Dharmendra and Babita in lead roles with Pran playing the villain of the story. It is an entertaining movie and worth a watch by all standards. The producer-director of this movie - Arjun Hingorani had a strange fancy regarding the titles of the movies made by him. He always used three 'K's in the title concerned. Hence the title here also contains three 'K's, considering the mystery-filled plot, the title is apt though.The movie opens with the killing of a rich man (Murad) in an accident staged by his adversaries. Then starts the world tour of Asha (Babita), the daughter of the victim. She happens to come across Anand (Dharmendra) during her sea-journey and they fall in love (quite naturally). When she is back home, attempts start on her life too. Apparently, it's her greedy uncle (Pran) only who is masterminding everything because he wants to usurp all the wealth of hers by eliminating her. Being unaware of her uncle's evil designs but quite aware of his licentious nature, Asha happens to kill him one night when he tries to molest her close friend Lata (Ashoo). On one hand, Anand is investigating the death of her father in his capacity of a C.I.D. officer, on the other she herself becomes a murderess who now has to get rid of the dead body of her uncle in her bid to escape the law. After many interesting incidents and twists in the story, the mystery gets unravelled.Kab ? Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan is a movie which contains the romantic encounter of the lead pair in the initial reels but soon gets on its crime and suspense-filled track. The main twist in the story arrives at the interval point and the narrative in the post interval session is so fast that it never loosens its grip on the spectator at any point of time. The result is - the spectator keeps on watching holding his breath and making guesses about the mystery and the further development of the story. The movie has been written as well as directed very well.There are ample doses of romance blended with comedy in the movie but finally, it's the suspense aspect that takes it over. Firstly, it appears to be a flat crime-thriller with a well-identified villain (Pran) and his well-identified villainous activities. However gradually the story advances in such a way that an aura of mystery prevails on the screen and consequentially on the minds of the viewers. The movie does not bore at any place and it has been made by using all the regular Bollywood formulae whose mix appears to be almost right. There may be viewers who are able to guess the solution of the mystery correctly. They are bound to feel entertained by this flick all the same.Performances are admirable. Dashing hero Dharmendra, gorgeous heroine Babita (I always find her much prettier than her daughters who are high profile heroines of today) and the stylish evergreen villain Pran are all very impressive in their respective roles. Pran's unique style of smoking (leaving rings of smoke from his mouth) was something that nobody could imitate. His performance in the final part of the movie is simply awesome. Debutante Ashoo as the heroine's buddy, Helen as the villain's accomplice, Shetty as a rowdy on the ship, Hiralaal as a mysterious lunatic etc. are well in place. Asit Sen and Dhuman have done good comedy.Kalyanji-Anandji's music is not great but not bad either. The title track (Ho Gaye Tere Ho Gaye) is the best from the album. The music directors themselves alongwith the hero (Dharmendra) are the presenters of this movie.Technically this colour movie is up to the mark. The sequences involving the ship, the sea and the natural beauty are quite impressive. This mystery is a little bit scary too. Action and thrills are good. Length of the movie is also optimum.All in all, Kab ? Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan ? is an interesting suspense movie which the mystery fans can enjoy like anything. Courtesy the heart-tickling romance, the audience of romantic movies is also sure to like it.\n",

            "BHRAM REVIEW :-OTT platforms haven't seen horror genre in recent time because the genre is not suitable for underage audience. ZEE5 enters into Horror genre with psychological thriller flavour to gift audience something different in not so popular genre. Bhram is haunting, horrifying and chilling experience from the first frame till the last. It also has some logical medical issues as an explanation to the spiritual things and that makes it so realistic.Bhram is an interesting tale of an interesting character Alisha Khanna played by Kalki Koechlin. A car accident turns Alisha Khanna's life upside down. The bestselling romance writer moves to Shimla to her sister's place in order to start over. Bhumika Chawla plays Ankita Paul (a sister of Alisha) who is living with her husband Peter Paul (Sanjay Suri). Peter has a friend named Pradeep (Eijaz Khan) who is impressed by Alisha's beauty and writing. However, Alisha starts getting visions of a girl. At first, she dismisses it as hallucinations due to her psychological disorder. However, she finds out that the girl had died 20 years ago. On the pretext of writing a book, she starts investigating into the matter and finds striking evidence which otherwise could never be found. Things point to certain prominent people of the place, but then they end up dying one by one. Alisha doesn't know that she has put her own life in danger. How far will one woman go to give justice to a dead girl? The answer lies in that incident which happened 20 years ago.

Bhumika Chawla, Sanjay Suri, Eijaz Khan, Satydeep Mishra are also brilliant. Costumes of every character are very talky, especially in terrifying scenes in dark light.Bhram is set and mostly shot in Shimla and the locations are eye pleasing. Cinematography of Vidhushi Tiwari is top notch. Background Music leaves you with jitters and it is so scary that it forces you to jump from your place. Screenplay is engaging because the story keep unfolding the backdrops and new twists. Director Sangeeth Savan tries something different from his regular flow and succeeds. He bounds the gripping story with proper execution and get everything right in important scenes.Overall, Bhram has haunting story powered by excellent performances by every actor. Locations, background music and frightening scenes takes it one step higher. It keeps you hooked from the start and never loses that grip untill you're blown away at the end.

            "Hindi cinema, especially from the 1970s up to the early 2000s, is known to have adopted a very unrestrained and melodramatic approach to storytelling. Sometimes, given a competent director, it was controlled very well within the parameters of given story, sometimes it was absolutely unwatchable. Basically it depended on how well a filmmaker appreciated the intelligence of the viewer. The need to mark every crucial moment with either a strong background score or exaggerated signs/expressions (or both) to the average viewer so as to let them know that a crucial moment is taking place, was a true example of how poor filmmakers trained audiences to think a certain way instead of letting them interpret the situation on their own.But then, there are other films, those melodramas made by filmmakers whose heart is in the right place. Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki is one such film. It is a most emotional story, and director Raj Khosla still makes the handling very stagy, yet it is portrayed with poignancy and soul that even those of us who are a little cynical about the sentimentality of such films might somehow be engaged. The film didn't have the same effect on me as films like, say, Mamta (1966), but it works. This is not to say it is a masterwork. It is, to my estimation, a most traditional mainstream film which is not spectacular but quite watchable and entertaining, and at points even involving and moving. The story and the dialogue work within this context, although the first half is much stronger.The film's moral stand is distorted in many ways throughout the story; sacrifice is a recurring motif: the man marrying a woman he doesn't love to conform to familial norms, the mistress sacrificing her own life to leave the man solely to his legal wife (it's preposterous, I know, she could have just left, but it's a movie you know), the wife raising up the illegitimate child, then the child, now grown, taking the blame for his brother's acts. It's almost a melodramatic comedy of sacrifices which hardly ring true, but the film works despite these moral misdemeanors. Beautifully shot, and intentionally sentimental, it is intended for Hindi movie buffs. The beautiful music culminates in the wonderful title track in Lata Mangeshkar's divine voice.Straight to the point, the film's prime asset is obviously Nutan, who gives this otherwise overly melodramatic fare its realistic energy with her naturalism and ability to be as unaffected as only an actor of her talent and calibre can be. Nutan shines in a fiery, transparent performance, and she is exactly the kind of actor who always respected her audiences. Asha Parekh is also very good as the mistress, although these parts of self-righteous courtesans are a bit off for me. Vijay Anand makes a nice appearance in the first half, but it is Vinod Khanna, an actor of great presence and style, who owns the show in a weaker second half and improves its low efficacy. Main Tulsi Tere Aangan, despite the shortcomings, is an unusually watchable fare.\n",

            "27 Down is as beautiful, truthful and evocative as the trains of the Indian railways which serve as its almost constant backdrop. And it induces the same yearning, for that forgotten taste of tea in a earthen cup, a little stale, a little metallic, a little too sweet and just a little bit dusty. But the reasons why 27 Down, a debut film by Awtar Krishna Kaul, a young man of 28 , made 44 years ago has survived as a classic of Indian cinema, lie beyond the overwhelming nostalgia of trains.Sanjay (M. K. Raina) was born on a train. For his birthplace, he mentions two places, much to the exasperation of the interviewer who is about to give him a job in the railways after Sanjays father has pulled a few strings. Sanjay is slightly adamant about it, the train was at an unknowable point in the vast labyrinth of railway tracks that span the country. This is his very minor rebellion against his father, who was a train driver and now wants his son to have a secure but dull job in the railways. He has very practical reasons for pushing his son in that direction, including perks like free coal that railway employees get to fire their mud ovens with at home.The young director about whom very little information is available online, must be reflecting on his career path in some way through this film, being an art film director in the late 60s must have been a far more radical career choice than it is today. Even now if one speaks to the teachers in two of India's leading state run film schools you hear of how a large section of students have revolted at home and sought a kind of refuge at the film school in the promise of a career as an artist.In an early scene in the film we see him as a child admiring a nude sculpture of Aphrodite and then we see him in a reputed art school in Bombay, a young man, away from his family. His father writes letters to him, offering him practical advice which we see Sanjay not heed, his mother has passed away and his father makes a big deal of acting protective. Somehow the director never foregrounds the artist in Sanjay, he is perhaps wary of making the film autobiographical ( Google does not know much about Avatar Kaul yet, but I shall find out one day and post an addendum to this review). When his father asks him to join the railways, Sanjay offers only half hearted resistance. He refers to his art education as \" I want to complete my studies\" to which his father says \" You can do that along with your job too!\". Sanjay is afraid to speak more clearly about his education, varnishing it as \"studies\". It is this strange tone of being unsure that defines the overall tone of the film for me.This attitude of meek capitulation is most telling in his marriage to a village girl of his fathers choice. Sanjay is having a serious affair with a girl, Shalini (a de-glamourised Rakhee), who he has met on a train. Orphaned early, Shalini now works in Bombay as a clerk to support her grandfather and siblings who live in another city. Now think of Satyajit Rays Mahanagar made in 1962 which portrays a housewife working to support her family and the shame that her husband experiences. Shalini is doing the same but Avatar Krishna Kaul is gently putting our middle class morality in the dock, in a style that is equidistant from Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwick Ghakat and the formalist Mani Kaul.27 Down is a singular voice in Indian cinema, not fully formed, hesitant to make its point but marshalling the power of the cinematic image to its advantage with a lot of passion, restraint and wonder. Along with his cameraman AK Bir, who was all of 22 years old and heavily influenced by Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers, they hold the hidden camera on crowded railway platforms and on moving trains and capture high contrast black and white images that evoke the romance of railways and the drudgery of travelling in a third class compartment, all at once.There are also hints of Jiri Manzels 1968 masterpiece Closely Watched Trains, and the moment I finished watching 27 Down, I told myself – \"This is our Closely Watched Trains\". In a way 27 Down too is a film about the confusion of youth in a socio economic climate in limbo, and the loss of innocence when confronted with the forces of world. We see Sanjay wilt under pressure from his father, lying in a stupor on sleeper trains. When he senses that the train is passing over a bridge we hear him philosophise incoherently. The numerous bridges connect nothingness with nothingness and the train for him is running in a maddening never-ending loop. 27 Down refers to the train route – \"Bombay to Varanasi\", the holiest city for Hindus. Even though Sanjay takes that train he returns from Varanasi in spiritual despair .This is a remarkably open film, a moving feast of images and moods, which will draw in viewers in its embrace. This was the only film that Awtar Krishna Kaul made and it adds up to much more than what many achieved in a lifetime.\n",

            "Bhrashtachar review :The legendary Ramesh Sippy is one of my favorite directors and so naturally, I have seen his entire filmography from Andaz (1971) right to Shimla Mirchi (2020).Bhrashtachar, featuring Rekha, Mithunda and Rajinikanth, was actually beginning of Ramesh Sippy's downfall and all films he made after this were critical and commercial failure. The story with its multiple characters is more suited for TV series which Manohar Shyam Joshi was famous for. He had written the super successful Buniyaad for Ramesh Sippy. But the lethargic plot about corruption didnt quite fit in to the film format. Laxmikant Pyarelal's music was another downer and Bhrashtachar was filled with unnecessary songs.Rekha and Mithun da performed earnestly as ever but again there was no chemistry between them at script level. Anupam Kher's Purshottam was almost an extension of his Arjun (1985) character. Shilpa Shirodkar and Abhinav Chaturvedi (Nanne from Buniyaad) were wasted. Not many know that Aamir Khan was approached for Abhinav's role but he refused.Rajini Sir appeared in a cameo as Abdul Sattar, a benevolent don who flicks a cigarette even in a courtroom. When the judge reprimands him, Rajini corrects him that he hasnt lighted the cigarette yet. Lol.More than anything, Bhrashtachar became infamous for a cringy rape scene picturised on debutant Shilpa Shirodkar who played a blind girl abducted and brutally raped by politician Anupam Kher. Picturised with multiple mirrors, the elaborate scene left little to imagination and it was second such shocking scene after Zeenat Aman's Insaf Ka Tarazu (1980).Overall, an underwhelming film from Ramesh Sippy though his direction was as competent as before. Watch the scene where Anupam Kher shoots his crony Sudhir Pandey as he falls on a swing and you will understand my point!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni\n",

            "2001 or Do Hazaar Ek (two thousand and one) starts with the murder of a callgirl - Julie (Upasna Singh) and this murder is followed by many other murders which are of advocates (Navneet Nishaan and Sarat Saxena), businessmen (Gulshan Grover and Suresh Oberoi) and a minister (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) also. A unique number - 2001 is found as written near every dead body. The cops investigating these crimes include Commissioner of Police - Malik (Mohan Joshi), inspector Sunil (Jackie Shroff) and inspector Rajat (Rajat Bedi). Sunil is mature whereas Rajat is capricious but they have to adjust with the polar different natures and approaches of each other because their boss has instructed them to work together on this case. Rajat falls in love with a petty criminal girl - Billu (Tabu) amidst carrying out his assignment. Sunil is happily married to Roshni (Dimple Kapadia). Gradually Sunil and Rajat get adjusted to each other and work in harmony to unearth the mystery behind these murders as well as the number - 2001 which the killer has written near the corpse of every victim.This movie has been directed by Raj N. Sippy who had once presented quality movies like Inkaar (1977), Satte Pe Satta (1982) and Satyamev Jayate (1987). However this movie highlighted that his time was over. He could have presented a gripping murder mystery but he faltered big time. Instead of concentrating on the mystery, he devoted his resources (the most important resource being the duration of the movie) to the masala meant for the regular movie buffs viz. sex, comedy, romance, songs and action. In fact, more than the director, the action director seems to have worked hard because the action-sequences are too many and quite prolonged. Plus we have the rom-com involving the debutant hero (Rajat Bedi) and the seasoned heroine (Tabu) which also has got ample footage. The mystery behind the (several) murders have been neglected amidst all these whereas it only should have got prominence because of being the part and parcel of the basic story.Still, the movie is not a complete disappointment for the typical Bollywood movie viewers who enjoy action, romance, comedy and songs. If you take interest in the mystery aspect, you will get bored because the flow of the mystery based narrative is blocked quite frequently (every now and then) by songs, comic scenes, romantic scenes and action-sequences. However if you enjoy all the time tested formulae used by the Bollywood filmmakers, then you may like the stuff coming on the screen. Putting it frank and straight, the screenplay could have been written in a much better way and could have been presented on the screen in a much better way as well. The movie is not a disaster all the same.Performances are all okay. Jackie Shroff and Dimple Kapadia have done satisfactorily. Tabu has, seemingly for a change, done a different type of role but she amuses the audience by her interactions with her hero - Rajat Bedi as well as her maternal uncle (Deven Varma). The baddies as well as the supporting case have done whatever might have been told to do by the director. But the actor who truly stands out is Rajat Bedi. Mainly this movie runs on his stout shoulders only. Other than the breathtaking action scenes, he has performed very well in romantic, comic and sentimental scenes too. Unfortunately he had to debut through this flawed movie, else he could have carved a niche for himself in Bollywood.Anand Raj Anand's music is forgettable. However, the movie boasts of technical excellence. The art director and the cinematographer have performed their parts proficiently. Editing is also OK. I have already admired the action director who has infused life into this actions studded movie. It's the action and thrill part of the movie which has made its viewing on the big screen as very delightful for the action lovers.I recommend this murder mystery which is more an action-thriller to the audience of action movies and suspense-thriller as a one time watch. The audience of romance and comedy also can give it a dekko because actually this is a mix-masala. The only word of caution is that it should not watched with a high degree of expectation, else you will feel letdown.My rating - 2.5 stars.\n",

            "Sen's 1976 film 'Mrigayaa' is a classy film. Honestly, Mithun Chakraborty is the life of this film. I mean this was the his first film and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor. Wow! His performance here, despite being his debut, leaves you stunned. Performance Wise:: I cant help myself but to praise Mithun's performance. I've been his biggest fan, and I am proud to know that India has a talent like Mithun. On the whole, 'Mrigayaa' is a classy watch. Mithun's performance alone, is enough to keep you gripped. Two Thumbs Up!\n",

            "I watched 'Lal Patthar' because earlier on I had watched a show on which Hema Malini stated that of all her performances, her own favourite performance of hers was the one in Lal Patthar. That struck me as a bit odd since it was the first time I heard this title and after checking out it turned out to be one of her very first film roles. It was also said that Malini's role in the film was negative. This further motivated me to watch it at any cost, which I ultimately did. And what can I say? This film is visually stunning but its story, though fairly good, does not really stand out. It is of course watchable and that's due to the presence of the actors, particularly that of Hema, but that is as far as it goes.Raaj Kumar stars as Kumar Bahadur, a prince who has vowed not to marry or drink because of a curse that runs in his family. One day while hunting for a tiger, he meets a kidnapped girl, Saudamini (Hema). He eventually takes her to live with him without marrying her. He renames her as Madhuri, but several attempts to transform her into an educated and well-mannered lady fail as she is lazy and unrefined and lacks willingness to change. Several years later, he meets another young and beautiful woman named Sumita (Raakhee), who he ultimately decides to marry, much to the displeasure of Madhuri who is unhappy to see another woman entering the household she has been in charge of for so long.Don't know who said Malini's character in the film was negative, but all those who say this are simply wrong. Her character is not negative at all, only that it has some grey and negative shades which all of us actually have. Throughout the film it's easy to identify with her acts and understand her anger. She does get to be manipulative and mean, but never despicably vicious. At times we can even see some of the features her subsequent famous roles would have, like Geeta from 'Seeta Aur Geeta' and Basanti from 'Sholay'. One particular scene which reminds us of her extraordinary comic talent is the English lesson scene, which is hilarious. Malini is quite clearly the main reason to watch this film, and her role is definitely a very well-written one. She is amazingly beautiful throughout the film (to the extent of looking like a doll), her eyes are expressive, and her line delivery is good. But calling it her best performance would be simply unfair, as she's been so much better in so many films since then. I'm still surprised she herself considers this her best work. The other lady, Raakhee, is also extremely beautiful, but she has hardly a role to speak of. Raaj Kumar is effective as the confused prince. Lal Patthar is nowhere a bad film, but there is not much to expect from it. Watch it if you are interested to see Hema Malini's personal favourite out of her own performances, or if you are into Hindi fairy tales.\n",

Interesting take on the lower middle class teen's of India. With one of the most unusual ending, leaves you wanting for more. This one's certainly worth a watch. Its been almost a decade since this film was made, don't understand a reason for it to be banned. The controversial parts of the movies are really mellowed down. If the censor board still finds something wrong with it, i would say they must be watching a different film altogether.\n",

            "For the most of first half this movie there was Dharmendra and Padmini in the spotlight and that was all fun and romance and light moments. But the second half totally belongs to Meena Kumari who is just terrific in every scene.Kaajal is based on Gulshan Nanda's novel 'Maadhvi' and the story is somewhat complex. Madhavi(Meena Kumari) and his brother Kaushal(Sailesh Kumar) lives with Ranimaa(Dugra Khote) and Rajesh(Dharmendra) is her only son. Rajesh is fond of Kaushal and Madhavi. He meets Bhanu(Padmini) and falls in love with her. Both gets married. Kaushal then dies in an accident and Rajesh thinks he is guilty. However Bhanu is not comfortable with Madhavi and is jealous of her. Madhavi runs off from home and tries to end her life but is saved by Moti(Raj Kumar). He marries her. But the drama gets twisty.There is layers in every character. And the second half of the movie is not an easy watch. There is lots of emotions involved and relationships being tested.Director Ram Maheshwari has done a terrific job. This was his first film and he manages to pull it off with command. The execution and adaptation of novel to movie is good. Though there are some weak points. He manages to show characters with conviction.The movie is completely based on Madhavi's life and the drawback I find in the movie was the in the first hour of the movie there was not much of her character being shown. The first half was filled with all fun and romance and light moments and its actually the second half when the story develops and it's disturbing to some extent.You feel for Madhavi while watching the movie and Meena Kumari has done complete justice to her character. The pain and the sufferings is completely visible and it's hard to see Meena Kumari in this movie, you will only notice Madhavi. She is completely in the character and gives a memorable performance.Dharmendra's is also terrific as Rajesh. He is also suffereing because all of the drama going on and his jealous wife and he is aware of the suffereing of Madhavi.Raj Kumar is superb as a drunk husband with negative character. He manages to pull off his character with such ease.The whole movie is just about relationship and the misunderstandings and sufferings.Music of the movie is another strong point and every song of the movie is a classic.All in all this is story telling at its best and more than story telling, its the performance that will impress you, especially the character of Madhavai played by Meena Kumari.\n",

            "The movie is simply amazing. The concept, the characterisations, the script, the screenplay, the performances, the dialogues, the comedy, rd burman's fabulous music -- everything, every aspect of this movie is simply outstanding. This movie made by Jyotin Goel is criminally underrated -- probably because it was made in the 1980s when there was hardly any publicity as is the case these days. Still the movie was a success and deserved every bit of it. The plot -- inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's classic North by Northwest, albeit with many changes to suit Indian tastes -- involves a happy-go-lucky man Ashok Saxena (Sanjay Dutt) whose life turns topsy turvy when the gang of villains (led by Amrish Puri) assume him to be a CID agent. He's also accused of murder and the police is after him -- with a Rs 10,000 reward on his head. While on the run he bumps into an aspiring model, Sonia Srivastav (Meenakshi Sheshadri, and the two fall in love. But life isn't as rosy, and his girl, not as innocent as she seems. The suspense element comes as a surprise and the climax is nailbiting. Dutt is in excellent form and this movie was a perfect follow up to Naam. Meenakshi was charmingly effective. Watching her perform one can't help but wonder how could Bollywood waste such a talented actress. The crackling chemistry between the lead pair poses yet another question. Why didn't they do some more films together? But that very reason makes Inaam Dus Hazaar an affair to remember. A movie that can be watched when one wants to lift of his/her spirits. One last word: two of RD's compositions in this film \"Chand Koi Hoga Tumsa Kahaan\" and \"Jaane Bhi Do Yaar\" are real gems. Again criminally underrated. Overall a good masala entertainer and certainly one of Sanjay Dutt's best movies.\n",

            "'Gauri: The Unborn' is one messy flick. What drew me to watch this film was Rituparna Sengupta and Atul Kulkarni. The two seasoned actors are known for their very good acting and films. However, they are at their most inconsistent here. Both actors overact in many scenes and are just alright in a few, though Rituparna has her moments. Anupam Kher is alright and the child actors are pretty bad (blame the director for this). The screenplay does not impress at all nor does the script convince. The execution is very poor. There are silly 'jump' sequence wannabes that are supposed to be scary, many plot holes and unnecessary scenes. The songs are unnecessary and forgettable.Special effects look tacky. Cinematography is okay. Obviously, this is an anti-abortion film but the subject is handled in the most immature way and clearly the writer feels very strongly against abortion. I'm not against the film because I support abortion but I would have preferred to watch a film that shows both sides of an issue. However, there's just a lot more wrong with this film.\n",

The movie is directed by Rajiv S Ruia.The genre of the movie is Horror but the movie lacks everything and off course Horror.The movie starts with two foolish person entering in a cave and coming out with something and one of them dies, now why did they went into the cave from where did they got this info is something which you have to guess. The story then gets a time a time leap of two years and we can see the main female lead singing and some goons tries to chase her and one of them is killed by a ghost, in the very next scene the male lead enters who is an entrepreneur and had just launched his mobile phones in India sees the female lead and falls in love and start following her leaving all his important work, eventually he succeeds in impressing the girl and the torture starts which is termed as a movie.There are many loopholes in the movie such as how can the male lead finds the shell so easily that too without any maps or direction and that too without any diving gears. In one of the scene it's shown that the sister of the female lead is crying and roaming in the corridor of an hostel looking place and no one is hearing it, maybe the ghost have made all the people deaf. Thirdly the movie is shot in Mauritius but everyone is Indian even the goons in the start of the movie are Indian. The police inspector who is investing murder case appears and disappears at will.m, and the best part is the climax which is cliche and very much predictable.Overall the movie is boring and doesn't makes any impact. The acting is bad so as the direction and screenplay. Music is also bad and doesn't leave any impact. Mauritius is a beautiful country but the director had failed to make use of such a beautiful place.Overall a bad and boring movie but a predictable climax.\n",

The story telling is so seamless and realistic that you don't even doubt the authenticity even for a second. The greatness of Shyam Benegal is bulging out of every frame of the movie. He shows how can you take a very common social issue and make it into an unforgettable movie. How can you take a story which seems ordinary if verbally narrated and make it into a movie with incredible depth.All the casts are outstanding in their performance.

            "Despite a promising cast, Sarhad Paar is certainly not a masterpiece. Sanjay Dutt is one of my favourite actors and obviously there's little wrong with the way he is playing his character Ranjit... but to put it bluntly, it's not the kind of role he needs to put much effort in, and so he visibly didn't. The roles of Pammi and Simran, on the other hand, are too limited in scope to allow Tabu and Mahima Chaudhry to show off their skills: they mostly seem to be there to add colour, beautiful smiles and heart-breaking tears to the story.Sarhad Paar is definitely not a piece of crap. Agreed, the characters are cardboard, and I found it hard to identify with any of them. The scenario is neither particularly strong nor particularly consistent, but I've seen much, much worse. Especially in the second half one might expect more, some big events, a bit of good action, or at least some psychological development within the various characters. But instead, the story flows on, quietly, without any major surprises. That, I believe, is the biggest problem of this movie: it simply fails to catch. Even Ranjit's tragedy is shown with so many shortcuts and in an such an uninteresting way that it fails to evoke empathy. Thus, we are witnessing the chain of events from a safe distance, without ever caring much.The movie has a few assets as well. The music, written by Anand Raj Anand, is absolutely gorgeous. Besides, the film is beautiful visually, offering lots of wonderful pictures from Punjab that give a great impression of the atmosphere in that region. Fans of Sanju will be delighted to see their idol as a Sikh.All in all, this movie is neither good nor bad. It's worth giving it a shot, though, but don't expect too much of it. Personally, although I don't find it a dull movie, I don't think I will return to it soon.\n",

However, it's nothing more than a sorry-ass piece of garbage. I cannot understand why the aforementioned talented women didn't throw the script at the director's face, let alone do the movie. Money couldn't have been the reason as this bad joke of a movie looks very tacky. 'Hello Darling' relies on cheap jokes, sleaziness and the tried and tested formula used in B-grade films. There is practically no story as it can't seem to make up its mind on what it wants to say. While the otherwise talented cast (mentioned above) have been wasted here, non-actors like Celina Jaitley, Chunky Pandey and some unknowns only make 'Hello Darling' cheaper with their cringe-inducing 'acting'. Javed Jaffrey goes over the top as the overly flirtatious boss. This is among the worst of 2010.\n",

This film is a masterpiece, not only from the point of view of direction, performances and cinematography, but also because of the wideness of its plot and its capacity to capture and present the reality, in its natural wholeness. From the pitiable condition of a young widow to that of the agrarian workers, from the process of making of bonded labours to the theft of animals, and from the dynamics of caste politics in villages to the genocide of poor dalits,the film speaks on everything and captures the true nature of feudal oppression, which is responsible for all this. Its power lies in the simplicity with which it addresses all such issues and conveys a dissenting voice against these. In the end, it tries to provide and answer when the wife of a bonded labour of local landlord resorts to the last alternative left to her.For those interested in socially committed cinema( and not for those believing in art gracia art, or the lovers of entertainment), Damul(meaning hanging)will always remain an all time favourite.\n",

            "During the fifties, a youth with an ordinary personality started his career in Hindi movies and during the sixties, he went on become one of the most popular heroes of Bollywood with several jubilee hits to his credit. The commercial success of his movies reached such a point that he was fondly being called as Jubilee Kumar in the Indian cine-circles. His name was Rajendra Kumar (or Rajinder Kumar).When Rajendra Kumar was climbing the stairs of stardom, one more youth who had to drive trucks to make a living, got a break in Bollywood. He was so handsome that any girl could fall for his charms. The late sixties and the seventies saw his popularity graph going high and high only. His masculine persona brought him the tag of He-Man. His name was Dharmendra (or Dharminder).Director Mohan Kumar had a habit of keeping the names of his movies starting with the English letter 'A'. He made several movies with their names starting as such and cast Rajendra Kumar as hero in some of them (viz. Aas Ka Panchhi, Aman, Anjaana, Aap Aaye Bahaar Aai etc.) and Dharmendra in some other ones (viz. Anpadh, Aapki Parchhaiyaan etc.). However he made one such movie in which both these immensely popular Punjabi heroes were cast together and the most interesting thing about this movie is that Rajendra Kumar is the hero of this movie whereas Dharmendra is in a negative role. This unique movie is Aai Milan Ki Bela (1964).Aai Milan Ki Bela (the hour of uniting with the beloved has come) is the story of a poor but honest and committed youth Shyam (Rajendra Kumar) who gets a job in the estate of Mr. Chaudhary (Nazir Husain). He falls in love with the daughter of Mr. Chaudhary - Barkha (Saira Baanu). Shyam's joy knows no bounds once his childhood buddy Ranjeet (Dharmendra) returns from abroad and starts living there itself. These two close friends share everything because they do not see any difference between them. But ! But the love of opposite sex is not something that can be shared. And so the love of Barkha becomes the bone of contention between these two intimate friends who consider themselves as two bodies having a common soul. Since Barkha already loves Shyam, it's Ranjeet who has to be the loser. And then the friendship no longer remains the friendship. The humiliation of losing Barkha's love and a passion to get her, turns Ranjeet into a villain. He seeks the help of a baddie Madanlaal (Madan Puri) and traps Shyam under the false charge of making a woman named as Rupa (Shashikala) pregnant. Barkha starts misunderstanding Shyam and gets estranged from him. When Shyam comes to know that Ranjeet is the person behind his troubles, the spirit of friendship for Ranjeet in his heart also evaporates and thus the friends turn into sworn enemies. However all's well that ends well. Finally Shyam's mother's telling him a secret sets the things right.A girl can become a bone of contention between male friends and friendship can turn into enmity in no time, is something that we have seen in many movies. Gunday (2014) is the latest example. However by seeing Aai Milan Ki Bela, we come to know that the stuff is old, indeed very old. If you seek my opinion, though I believe in the spirit of true love, I advise my male friends never to run after a bus or a girl. You miss one, you are sure to get the next one which must be on the way to you. Anyway.Aai Milan Ki Bela is very interesting with little boredom in the narrative. The movie has been made long by the comedy track of Munshi Sridhar (Sunder) which is completely superfluous for the movie. However it generates quite a few laughs and it's in sync with the style of filmmaking as prevailing in Bollywood those days. The main track of tussle between Shyam and Ranjeet on account of Barkha is very interesting. The scene of the night when Ranjeet suddenly comes to know of the love blossoming between Shyam and Barkha and then its (adverse) impact on him has become very impressive with Dharmendra displaying a brilliant underplay of inner feelings of Ranjeet.All the three main protagonists have done exceedingly well. Romantic hero Rajendra Kumar and beauty queen Saira Baanu always made a perfect on-screen pair. Very lovely, very lovely indeed. Dashing Dharmendra seems to be miscast in the negative role (the first one for him and the only one done by him in his stint as a young hero), nevertheless he has done very well. Putting it straight, he is not a villain in the pure and traditional sense in this movie. His role can be termed as one with gray shades. The supporting cast too has fitted the bill.This colour movie is a visual treat with beautiful locations used for the story set in a milieu studded with natural beauty (i.e., the estate where the principal characters of this story live). All the technical aspects of the movie are well in place.Shankar Jaikishan have composed very good music for the movie with the help of the mesmerizing voices of Lata and Rafi and the touching lyrics penned by Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. The title track, Tumhen Aur Kya Doon Main Dil Ke Sivaay, Main Pyar Ka Deewana, O Sanam Tere Ho Gaye Hum etc. all the songs are a treat for the ears of any music lover.Summing up, Aai Milan Ki Bela is a highly entertaining movie which I recommend wholeheartedly to not only the fans of Rajendra Kumar, Saira Baanu and Dharmendra but to all the movie buffs in general. This movie does not disappoint anybody who watches it and that's why it was a box office hit also.\n",

            "I saw this film at Mumbai Film Festival, was pleasantly surprised since I had complete low expectations about this film. Films about complexity of relationships don't come much smoother than Manu Warrier's debut feature film Coffee Bloom. With a sundry of characters, Warrier's film is as fresh as a cup of coffee. It is warm, strong and unsweetened.Dev Anand is a man with sombre expressions. In his free time, he listens to spiritual audio recordings and reads the Amar Chitra Katha comic books. Dev's life takes a drastic turn when his mother dies. He returns to the coffee estate at Coorg, once owned by his family that he had sold off against his mother's wishes. There, amidst the lush coffee plantation, Dev comes face-to-face with the reality and the ghost of his past relationships.People say sometimes we need to get lost, to find ourselves. No matter how cryptic it might sound, it's true. It is interesting to watch Dev's self-discovery. His behavior is eccentric yet endearing. Warrier brilliantly scripted the character of his protagonist. At times you will hate the character of Dev, but still empathize with his situation.The versatile actor Arjun Mathur gives an unparalleled performance as Dev. The actor once again proved his acting prowess. The lighthearted puns of Srinivas (played by Mohan Kapoor) adds on to the perkiness of the film. Both the female characters, Anika (played by Sugandha Garg) and Shondha (played by Ishwari Bose) are intricately weaved into the film.Manu Warrier uses drama to explore human behavior, morality and relationships. And yes, he made a perfect a brew.Coffee Bloom may not be everyone's cup of coffee. But once in a while, there comes a film which refreshes our mind and soul. Coffee Bloom is one of them. It takes us deep into the tangled emotions of its characters, one sip at a time. And, in the end we are left with a refreshing afterglow. Just like the morning cup of coffee.\n",

            "WAW, that was the era's formula indeed; a romance, melodrama, some comedy with some action, blended all with songs. You may veto, saying that that the forever Indian formula for entertainment. Well, it is to some extend. Though, this round, it's done in such a lovable way, that makes it so entertaining and so Indian.We have big and adorable stars, which do their roles easily and effectively. (Amitabh Bachchan) is the king of coolness, who convinces me doing anything. Back then, he used to be the poor young man, today he just the opposite all along, maybe because - out of the pictures - he certainly moved to higher social degree. (Hema Malini) has the looks of everybody's sister, some glamour to be a kid, a woman, a happy soul, a sad victim all in one, and a talent for acting, and doing comedy; namely she's a capable actress and star. And (Pran), or dear (Pran), he's one of the most perfect number 2 guys of all times, being the greatest sidekick (Bachchan) had between Zanjeer (1973) and Nastik (1983), before becoming (Bachchan)'s dad or uncle. He's maybe the top scene stealer who (Bachchan), or else, ever worked with, being a magnetic star whatever the secondary role he does.I won't forget the invisible stars (Kishore Kumar) and (Lata Mangeshkar), the legendary playback singers. They did an amazing job as usual. I fell in love with songs like (Hum Bolega To Bologe Ki Bolta Hai) or (Rangmanch Yeh Duniya Sari). They were original Indian songs; original in terms of lyrics, music and performance. Maybe I love them because I'm Egyptian, and the eastern music aren't strange for me, but sure I respect them because nowadays most of the Indian cinema's songs aren't that original; instead, they're deformedly western, and expressing something between far-off Indian and off-the-wall Americanized!In 1974, it was ordinary, if not necessary, to see the evil man as a western, or western-like, guy. So that's why (Ramesh Deo), the playboy smuggler, was redheaded, wearing flashy suits and sunglasses. It was the so patriotic vision at the time, where \"not-Indian\" was mostly considered \"bad\". There is even a song, (Baby Ho Gayi Hai Jawan), to satirize the hippie culture as something not only foreign, but connected with what's degenerate and sinister, assuring the movie's conservative and decorous nature. However, on the other hand, the movie has an evil \"Indians\" in the story as well, and I mean the drunken rapist stepfather (Satyendra Kapoor), or the local smugglers. Thus a sense of objectiveness and balance is found.The shortcomings are few: while the character of (Pran) as a chivalrous criminal was catchy, his line digressed redundantly with fabricated action scene in a boat. I hate making laughs out of a stuttering man. I didn't like part of the lighting at the number of (Yeh Time Time Ki Baat). And the last battle suffered from some naivety; throwing a gun at a huge thug doesn't harm him badly as we saw!For a western viewer, matters like mixing melodrama with songs can be somewhat unfamiliar, if not forced. But hey, com'on, we're talking about the east of the world, and its own way of making entertaining cinema. It's basically based on that society, its status and needs. Look closer: a girl who undergoes social injustice; due to being imprisoned once, and having a murderer mother (status), goes to star in a musical theater with funny numbers as a solution (needs), the viciousness of smugglers and kidnappers (status) is fought and defeated eventually by the good guys (needs), and despite poorness, demeaning social look, alcoholic stepfather and evil rival (status), love can overstep all the obstacles, triumphing at last (the ultimate need!). It's not a dish; it's more like a meal with satisfying portions of romance, melodrama, action, comedy, and music; so the hungry audience gets more than full.Don't find it odd, it's in every cinema, the \"way\" is what differs, and that's merely the east's way. For example, the Egyptian cinema used to make the same kind of stories, with the same formula, back in the 1940s and 1950s, with only 2 differences; being shot in black and white, and performed by Egyptian stars. In fact, we have a movie named (Ishhadoo Ya Nas) or (Be Witnesses, People), produced in 1953, starring (Shadia) and (Mohseen Sarhan), of which (Kasauti) resembles greatly, concerning the main characters, drama, and formula, even the matter of the heroine being wronged by a family crises, having a criminal father not mother, tending to be a theater singer for overstepping her problem. The thing is, the Egyptian cinema's history isn't discovered internationally yet!So, this is the way the east was dreaming. Now, I long for these simple, goodhearted, and - why not - naive dreams. Because after a while in Bollywood, the sex and violence increased, the leads became suddenly rich brats, and the music and dance converted to American. It's not how the Indian cinema keeps up with what's happening, or expresses a new generation; it's frankly how it sloughs off the Indian reality, people and legacy; as if (Heera), the character played by (Ramesh Deo), came to be Bollywood's head movie-maker! In a word, (Kasauti) is entertaining and Indian, and - to a considerable extent - entertaining due to being Indian.\n",

            "A film worth seeing despite being very violent and plain insane from beginning to end, but it has something authentic to it. When Nana Patekar is the chieftain of one of two villages in a feud, you know that you're in for a rough time, desperation and pain awaits you (not unlike Shakti - The Power, but without a shrieking Karisma). Will anyone you care for in this movie survive? You won't know until you've seen it all the way to the bitter end. This is not for the faint of heart.We can't give away too much of the story. Only so much: A bride and a groom who are each from the other of the two villages happen study in the city, but are being married, both against their will and both without knowing each other, not even having seen each other once (because that is not how it is done here.) The wedding night ends in a massacre and from there on the couple is torn in this fight. How they finally get to know each other, and love, and whether they will ever get to live together is all going to be revealed in this film.It's violent, it's got action, guns and sticks and axes, but at least the violence is related to the plot and not so out of context as in so many other Bollywood flicks that have fighting scenes. And we also get to see a lot of rural Indian life, culture and beauty, and the director manages to let that shine through even all that madness.What I liked is that all people were portrayed as humans, no one was just a bad daemon. Even Nana Patekar was not just the tyrant that he was in Shakti, but was given a little more soul, even a romantic dance. But don't expect the personalities as in Swades, these are not modern politically-correct individualist free-thinkers, but villagers, who follow their leaders and follow the tradition and take their place at the food-chain. They are all completely consumed by this life and know little of the rest of the world. This picture is delivered quite authentic, and without any commentary. There is not a single sermon, none of the characters, not even the two young protagonists rise above their culture, they are just the way they are for better or for worse.This is a very remarkable film. Absolutely worth seeing. But not for the faint of heart.\n",

Saif, Sunil, and Sonali have some good big-budget films ready for release to erase this film's memory and Deepti is tasting success in the South.

            "Expectations: Dance based films have been one of a favorite genre of our Hindi cinema right from the silent era. One can never forget some great films like 'Kalpana', 'Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje', 'Sargam', 'Nache Mayuri', 'Amrapali' and a few more which were based on classical dancing. 'Disco Dancer' successfully introduced the modern dancing in our Hindi films and we witnessed some great films under this sub genre in the form of 'Taal', 'Dil To Pagal Hain', 'ABCD' and many more. Thanks to the reality based television shows like 'Boogie Woogie', 'Jhakal Dikhla Jaa', 'Nach Baliye', 'Dance India Dance' and few more the modern dancing has attained a great fan following. Thus, in order to capitalize over this fad, actor-director Saahil Prem comes up with his latest film 'M.A.D: Mad About Dance', which is based on the modern day international style of dancing. So let's find out whether 'M.A.D: Mad About Dance' will manage to give us another dance based entertainer, film on the lines of 'ABCD' or might be among those films which along with the lack of star value, lacks highly over its content also.Story: 'M.A.D: Mad About Dance' is story of Aarav (Saahil Prem), who goes to a small town of Sheffield in UK in order to learn the dance from his idol Caeser (Mark Monero). His friends help him in finding Ceaser, but Aarav fails to impress Ceaser through his dancing skills. This gives rise to an internal competition between Aarav and Ceaser's main lead dancer Henry (Jon Jo). Aarav and his friends start forming their own group and plans to participate against Ceaser and his group and what happens next is what the entire film is all about.Screenplay & Technicalities: The story has lots of similarities with 'ABCD' and is narrated in a super slow manner, which after a while starts to test your patience level. The writers indulge lots of unwanted tracks and melodrama which dilutes the impact of the dancing scenes. The middle portion just keeps dragging on a never ending note till the final twenty to thirty minutes of the film. It's only in that part where you will enjoy the competition dance followed by the finale dances and the end credits. The drama is very weak and the film has many unwanted tracks along with weak screenplay consisting of back to back over the top type of scenes. The dances too, in most of the parts of the film were non-engaging and lacked the entertainment factor. There are more than dozen loopholes and weak moments due to which your entire interest in the film is lost and if you can survive these, you will witness some brilliant international and national dancing in the finale portions.Music & Direction: Music in such films has to be essential. Sadly in the case of this film, it fails to create any mark among its viewers.Saahil Prem comes up with a story idea which is almost similar to 'ABCD', but packaged in an international and youth manner. He also opts out for an outdated pattern of narration, which are super slow and even boring at times. Though, he saves the best for the last which is totally entertaining.Performances: Saahil Prem looks good and dances well in the finale portions. He is weak in the dramatic portions and lacks the energy level in his character. Amrit Maghera hams to the fullest. Salah Benlemqawanssa is brilliant in his dances, once he enters the film you won't be able to take out your eyes from him. Akhilesh Unnitan, Abhishek Saha, Raashul Tandon lend good support. Jon Jo and Mark Monero are the worst among all others.Final Verdict: There is a fantastic dumb for everyone who loves to watch some good dance, but only in the last twenty to thirty minutes. In order to witness this, you will have to sit through this never ending film till the finale portions. In short, this dance based film is on the lines of slow dancing, where every step seems same and repetitive, but grabs its momentum only towards the end of the dance.\n",

            "Best film with Jeetendra-Jayaprada-Sridevi trio. They rock. A very beautiful and touching film. Jayapradha scores above the rest for acting and dances; Sridevi performs well for some parts. Jayaprada and Sridevi are sisters; they look like real. They love the same man (Jeetnedra) and before he realizes the love shared between them; Jayapradha confesses her love. Exceptionsl twist of sacrifice and love between sisters. The soundrack to this film is beautiful and combies the sounds beautifully. All the songs are great to lisne; the most famous being Tohfs..Tohfa..picturised beautifully on Jayaprada and Jeetendra. A classic scene is when Sridevi comes home after marrying Shakti Kapoor and the showdown follows with sister Jayaprada. Another highlight is the love confessions scene between sisters. A shame that they don't make interesting films like these anymore...\n",

            "Sunil Shetty was one of the most unfortunate actors in the 90s. Despite getting hits and superhits in the first portion of his career, things didn't work out quite well. Starting from the 1994 flop Hum Hain Bemisaal, Sunil Shetty gave flops and only flops until the semi hit Rakshak followed by superhit Krishna and the average grosser Sapoot. 1996 was mainly known as his comeback as these hit films I've listed proved to revive Shetty. Sadly, even 1996 wasn't a completely decent year for Sunil Shetty. Films like Shastra flopped and this film Ek Tha Raja was a complete disaster.Ek Tha Raja was Shetty's first release in 1996, the film didn't help Shetty's career much and Saif Ali Khan called it one of his worst films ever in the UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH PREITY ZINTA show. The film is about the Dogra family which consists of Lalchand Dogra, Parvati Dogra, and 3 sons Jay, Sunny, and Raj. Due to certain barriers and problems, the family separates. Now after many years, Lalchand is released from prison and he wants to bring this family back togehter. The main problem is that none of his sons remember him and all of them are against him as well as each other.The movie is nothing but a typical cringeworthy Bollywood movie. The movie and the handling of the film is equally bad, the way the story movies, the pace is irritating. Some of the scenes are horribly edited, poor editing is one of the major minus points of the movie. Even for a 90s movie, it should have scenes that make sense, just because your movie is from a period where Indian cinema wasn't developed doesn't mean you make craps. In the 90s, many bad movies released but this makes those bad movies look good. This and Bombay Ka Babu are equally bad, both of them did nothing but injustice to Saif's career.Performances are nothing to shout about, none of the performances are even worth 20 seconds of clapping. You could clap for 5 seconds for Shetty's typical cop act as he does an alright job. However, his shouting and anger expressions are irritating. Man he was a bad performer in some of his movies. Saif Ali Khan doesn't do anything great, he gives a been there done that feel and does his same bland girly comedy and cheesy dancing just like he did in the average but better film Tu Chor Main Sipahi with Akshay Kumar. Aditya Pancholi is a damn good actor but this film did nothing but bring his career down. The film has him walking around, speaking typical one liners which get extremely annoying after 2-3 scenes. Kader Khan is getting extremely typecast. The other villains have nothing good to do except ham even in the scenes when they get beaten up by the heros. Neelam, and some of the other heroines have nothing but same old age crap romantic dialogs to deliver. None of them do good even in the scenes that are meant to be funny.Direction by Dayal Nihaalini is a total disappointment. For being the brother of veteran filmmaker Govind Nihaalini, he totally brings a bad name to the family. He never quite gave good films, with the exception of some of his earlier films, this film and Insaaf: the Final Justice with Akshay Kumar are nothing but horrible craps. Both of these films met with nothing but disaster status at the box office.On the whole, Ek Tha Raja is one of those nonsensical craps that not only did bad business at the box office, but is remembered for being one of the worst craps for even the biggest action star Sunil Shetty.\n",

The plot is overlaid with bad guys, lots of twists and turns (done with the utmost of corn), and the requisite boy-mom, street boy, boy-girl, revenge and reunion scripts that are so Bollywood. There is nothing redeeming about this movie, but you'll find yourself dressing like him at Halloween, or plopping in the DVD for a party anyway.

Mirza Ghalib, unarguably the best Poet of Urdu Language has been portrayed remarkably in this show. None other than Naseeruddin Shah could have played this role. His persona and dialog delivery along with outstanding facial expressions made him look like the real life Mirza Ghalib. Music by Jagjit Singh simply can never again be made. It's one of those few things that are produced and never be replicated by anyone. Kaifi Azmi and Gulzar did ravine deep research before going ahead with the series. Most actors were stage actors including Rajendra Gupta, Shafi Inaamdar and others. Tanvi Azmi did well in her cameo and so did Neena Gupta. Every single Ghazal sung by Jagjit Singh simply takes you back to the Delhi of 1800s. Naseeruddin Shah himself notes that Ghalib's role is the number achievement of his acting career. Finally an official 2 DVD Set is out of this show. Quality is about 8.5/10 I would highly recommend people to purchase it. I have done quite a bit of research on Mirza Ghalib, visited his Haveli in Old Delhi this summer and count this show as an all time favorite of mine.10 STARS!!!!!!*********\n",

            "This movie is a rare gem in Hindi Cinema by Saeed Akhtar Mirza. Although it doesn't seem to have a coherent plot, it still keeps you hooked on till the end. It has a very distinct visual style keeping your senses engaged all the time.The opening sequence is one the most memorable from what I have seen. The craftsmen in a village are shown engaged in creating intricately designed carpets. The scene beautifully shifts from the village to a posh handicraft shop in a prominent Bombay locality where these carpets are kept for sale. We hear the tourists going gaga over the wares of the shop - and a sale is made. The journey from the producer to the consumer is complete.Arvind Desai is the young and suave owner of this business that he has taken over from his father. He clearly is rich, seemingly well educated and is dating his secretary-Alice from work. His staff at the store, Mahesh who is his cousin and Gopal, lack respect for Arvind specially since he is rarely seen at work.Arvind doesn't seem to like his work and is seen for most of the time loitering around Mumbai in his car. Mumbai itself is an important character in the movie and gets a lot of screen-time. The sights and sounds of Mumbai in the late 70's is nicely captured in the movie. Although Arvind is uninterested in his fathers business he is not clear with what he exactly wants his in life.The turbulence in his mind increases as the movie progresses. He is unable to see his cousin Mahesh start his own racket by selling goods at lower prices to customers. The profits dwindle and he is unable to take the pressure from his dominating father. He doesn't take his own decisions and is still controlled by his father as can be seen from the fact that he doesn't fire Mahesh even if he wants to. Arvind also breaks up with Alice over a silly argument, questioning whether he really loved her in the first place. Later he is forced into an arranged marriage which he accepts.Unable to take control over his life and make proper decisions, he gets disoriented. As well put by his Marxist friend, there is quite a disconnect in terms of his thinking and his actions. Even though Arvind seems to have the right thoughts and ideals he doesn't ever act on them. Examples of this are seen throughout the film.The film ends in the most enigmatic way staying true to the title. Arvind's ways continue to baffle. But in the end that could be said about most men- even though we seem rational, we continue to make confounding and irrational choices. Arvind never really comes of age in the movie, and maybe will never be able to make the transition. Do watch the movie as it will linger in your mind for days.\n",

This movie is a typical movie that flopped despite Devgan's performance. This movie is only good with the parts Devgan has to act his skills out. The rest is just some unknown hero and heroine doing bad acting and making even the sad scenes look fake. But, Ajay even in his bad movies stands out completely. Direction is not handled well but scenes are edited well. Its not bad in terms of editing, its bad in terms of screenplay. A 3 hour long movie with action only in the last 20-30 minutes of the film.

Many of my friends at that time were already Hindi movie fans and persuaded me to watch. They told me about good songs, handsome heroes and beautiful heroines. Finally when Pyar Ka Mausam was screened in my hometown, I decided to go to the cinema. That was really the turning point for me. I was glued to the screen, enjoyed the songs by Mohd. Rafi and Lata, and was fascinated with the handsome Shashi Kapoor and beautiful Asha Parekh. They are my favourite stars until now. Since then I never missed Hindi films that came to town, especially if the films had Shashi and Asha in it, or either one of them. Old Hindi movies are sold in VCD's in Malaysia and of course Pyar Ka Mausam is in my collection. I will always cherish this film and remember it in my heart.

A poor widow Maaya (Nirupa Roy) kills a rapist to save her honour but then leaves her little son in a temple so that his life is not spoiled on account of her misfortune. Destiny makes such a move that Maaya happens to work as a maid in the house of the same gentleman - Lala Jugal Kishore (Nazir Hussain) who picks the boy-child from the temple and then fosters him as his own son. Maaya recognizes his son but keeps silent because she feels that her son's welfare lies in her silence in this regard only.Maaya's son grows up as Jai (Dharmendra) and falls in love with Aarti (Aasha Paarekh). After heavy doses of romance and comedy being administered to the audience, the story gets twisted when Jai is caught for the murder of a cabaret dancer. His fostering family disowns him but his biological mother, i.e., Maaya stands by him revealing to him this fact that he's her son only. How Jai is able to prove his innocence, how the real murderer is exposed and how the expected happy ending to the story is brought about is shown in the final reels of the movie.The director has not allowed the audience to yawn even for a moment throughout the duration of the movie. There are enough relief moments in the narrative. The romance of the hero and the heroine itself starts after some hilarious incidents. Then the comedy track of Saadhuraam Sood (Rajendra Naath) and Sangeeta (Laxmi Chhaya) is also quite humorous. Thus the narrator soaks the audience amply in laughs and romance before the serious business begins.Dashing Dharmendra and pretty Aasha Paarekh always made a lovely on-screen pair. Aaya Saawan Jhoom Ke is one more example of their great on-screen chemistry which is able to turn any heart as romantic. The character of Dharmendra is the backbone of the whole story and this natural actor seldom let any role down in his entire career. All others have also done their respective bits with perfection.This colour movie is a treat to watch. The art director and the cinematographer have filled the frames of this movie with beautiful colours. All the technical aspects are in order. The movie is too long but considering the absence of boredom, the length is not felt. The music composed by Laxmikant Pyarelaal with the help of Anand Bakshi's lyrics is another big asset of this well made movie. The title track, Saathiya Nahin Jaana Ki Jee Na Lage, Kisi Ne Kaha Hai Mere Dosto, Yeh Shama To Jali Roshni Ke Liye etc. are precious gems from the treasure of Hindi film music. The music lovers still listen to these and cherish that aura that used to exist then.Summing up, Aaya Saawan Jhoom Ke is a complete entertainer with all the formulae mixed optimally to present a spicy and delicious product to the consumers, i.e., the Indian cine-lovers. Watch it any day, any time and get yourself drenched in the showers of entertainment.\n",

            "The Gold Medal (1984) is one of those unfortunate movies which take an extra-ordinary time in getting completed (this way or that way) and / or released. Mostly such movies which get completed at a crawling pace or released years later than they were made, render a feeling of staleness to the audience who rejects them outright irrespective of their entertainment value. Sometimes such movies suffer from continuity jerks too (because of dates problem of the principal characters) and that also go against them. Please don't get confused by the title of the movie because the gold medal here does not refer to the gold medal won by anybody in some contest or examination. Here it refers to the identification symbol of the members of a criminal gang. All trusted members of that gang are given gold medals (containing the logo of the gang) by their boss. Our hero could arrange a gold medal for him only in the climax but gets exposed before the gangleader before he could get it and then the action-packed ending scenes take place to bring an end to the story.The Gold Medal starts with the killing of an honest, sincere and dedicated trade union leader (Dharmendra) who has been taking on the management of a factory for the cause of the workers. The owner of the factory (K.N. Singh) is not only a greedy and corrupt industrialist but also a traitor who arranges fracases, riots and unrest in Indian for enemy countries as well as corrupt fellows like him and gets handsomely paid for every such misdeed. His criminal gang is involved in smuggling activities too. After masterminding the killing of the union leader, he tries to buy the integrity of the second most significant union leader (Shatrughan Sinha) but fails. However he has many other ways to handle this another honest man which he applies on him.On the other hand, the case of catching the murderers of the union leaders as well as eliminating this dangerous anti-national gang is handed over by the head of the Indian intelligence wing (David) to the hero (Jeetendra) and the heroine (Raakhee). The original clue to start the investigation is a gold medal found with the dead body of a member of this gang. How our hero and the heroine reach the core of this gang and eliminate it, forms the remaining part of the story.The Gold Medal is an entertaining crime-thriller made in the style of the seventies. But the problem is the same as mentioned by me in the beginning of this review. The movie got released in 1984 but just by passing through certain scenes of it, it becomes evident to the viewer that its making must have started at least a decade prior to that. The youthfulness visible on the faces of Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Shatrughan Sinha and Raakhee explains the long journey of its making and release in the fraction of a moment. The sets, the presentation style, the actors, the action sequences, the songs and dances; just everything evidences that it is a movie of the early seventies and not the eighties. Hence it appears that the audience of the eighties could not accept it.Besides, the movie suffers from continuity jerks and unbalance too. The footage got by the heroine, i.e., Raakhee is very less which is perhaps due to the producer's failure in getting the sufficient number of her dates. Ditto for Shatrughan Sinha. Thankfully, this is not the case with the hero of this movie, i.e., Jeetendra who has carried this movie on his shoulders in his famous jumping jack style with his changing looks (due to the passage of time as the movie got delayed in its completion). In the beginning reels, K.N. Singh is shown as the main villain but the post-interval session shows Premnaath as the main villain who runs the gang from behind the curtain. Still one more villain is there who is termed as the supremo of the gang whose identity is revealed in the ending scene only which fails to convince the viewer because there has been no such indication towards him in the earlier part of the movie. The happenings of the story contain very less relevant to justify the title of the movie.All the same, The Gold Medal is an entertaining crime-thriller. The seasoned director has handled the story well despite the obvious limitations and he has been able to present a regular potboiler for the audience liking such movies. Songs and dances have been inserted at different places as per the norm of that period. The movie contains all the regular Bollywood formulae but the less footage for the heroine has diluted the romance element in the story presented on the screen.Shankar Jaikishan have composed forgettable songsc for the movie (it must be Shankar alone because Jaikishan had passed away in 1971). Still the opening song (Aazaadi Aayi Bhi To Kya) which has been picturized on Dharmendra and others is impressive. All the actors have performed routinely. However Jeetendra should be admired for getting this movie completed and ensuring that it becomes at least an above average entertainer. Dharmendra is only in the opening sequence of the song - Aazaadi Aayi Bhi To Kya and then the killing of himself and he is perhaps the most impressive performer.On the box office, The Gold Medal sank without a trace. Stale movies have to meet this fate only. I recommend The Gold Medal to those movie buffs who enjoy watching crime-thrillers made in the style of the seventies. It won't disappoint them if seen with a low expectation.\n",

            "Anmol is a very good movie with big actors.Manisha's performance really touches the heart and you feel with her in every second of the movie. Rishi Kapoor is of course brilliant of course. Not only the actors, but also the storyline is great. There was no scene where i felt bored. So it's a good entertaining movie. There are many sad scenes in the movie, so melancholy lovers will love it. And there are also some scenes where you can't stop laughing. Also the songs are big hits, with voices of Lata and Kumar Sanu. For example the songs Ayegi Woh Ayegi and Dil Lagane Ki are unforgettable songs. So people, what do you want more than this?!?!! I really can recommend it and hope you will like it, too.\n",

This precociousness lands him in a soup when he is unable to explain as to why he robbed a bank and a killed a person.This is a stylish movie that is very watchable with a caveat.The violence is decidedly G rated.

            "Making the things disappear from the sight of the onlookers (or someone's possession) is called an art of magic which the professional magicians demonstrate in their shows. In Indian lingo, this is called - Haath Ki Safaai (the craft of the hand). But some petty criminals use the same term for their act of pickpocketing too, boasting this skill of theirs with pride and considering it no less than any other art. In the movie - Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya (2012), the sister of the hero keeps this 'art' of hers in high esteem and later it is known that she demonstrates it every now and then because she wanted to be a professional magician but couldn't. The moral of the story is that youths pick up the wrong path when they do not get any right path to channelize their skills and energy. Hence it is important that the society provides opportunities to them to utilize their talent and vigor in the right direction.Haath Ki Safaai (1974) is a run-of-the-mill Bollywood movie based on the 'lost and found' formula in which two brothers are separated in their childhood and cross paths in their youth. The title of the movie has been kept after this craft of the hand (Haath Ki Safaai) professionally adopted by the younger one of them. The movie is a very entertaining one.The person demonstrating his Haath Ki Safaai in this movie and is proud of this art of himself is Raju (Randhir Kapoor) who was separated from his brother Shankar (Vinod Khanna) in childhood. Both these brothers have grown up in criminalized environment and criminals' company and therefore, become criminals themselves. Raju has become a pickpocket whereas Shankar becomes a gangster. Destiny makes them cross paths time and again and they start disliking each other (without knowing that they are actually brothers). Shankar is happily married to Roma (Simi Grewal) who wants her husband to leave the path of crime and finally, he agrees for that. However the crime world is not a place so easy to quit.Raju comes across a runaway rich girl - Kaamini (Hema Malini) who is escaping from his uncle who is forcing her to marry Ranjeet (Ranjeet) against her will. Gradually Raju and Kaamini fall in love. But it's Kaamini only which again becomes a bone of contention between Raju and Shankar. After a lot of drama and action, the brothers finally identify each other and the reunion of all the four lead characters takes place with the arrest of the baddies.The USP of this potboiler is the character of Randhir Kapoor alongwith his heart-winning performance. He makes the audience laugh time and again with his perfect comic timing. The memorable comedy song - Peene Waalon Ko Peene Ka Bahaana Chaahiye is a showcase of his comic talent. His demonstration of his pickpocketing art not only justifies the movie's title but also entertains the viewers very much.Writers Salim-Jaaved and director Prakash Mehra have done their best in making a thoroughly engrossing movie. The screenplay studded with the frequent encounters of the two male leads is taut and does not allow any boredom to creep in. Action, thrill, romance and sentiments are there in the movie in optimal quantum but it's the comedy which overpowers everything and adds immense value to this apparently ordinary movie.In addition to Randhir Kapoor, the other main characters also have done pretty well. Vinod Khanna won the Filmfare best actor award for his role in this movie. However I admire Simi Grewal very much who was always a natural performer irrespective of the role assigned to her. Hema Malini had started her career a few years back as the heroine of Raj Kapoor but in this movie she is quite at ease while playing the heroine of Raj Kapoor's son, i.e., Randhir Kapoor.Kalyanji Anandji have composed good music for the lyrics of Gulshan Bawra. Peene Waalon Ko Peene Ka Bahaana Chaahiye (Kishore-Lata) is the most popular song of the album which proves to be no less than a mini laughter show for the audience. But the other songs - Vaada Karle Saajna Tere Bin Main Na Rahoon Mere Bin Tu Na Rahe Hoke Juda, Tumko Mohabbat Ho Gai Hai Humse, Tu Kya Jaane Wafa O Bewafa, Oopar Waale Teri Duniya Mein Kabhi Zeb Kisi Ki Na Khaali Rahe etc. are also quite good.Technical aspects are all in order. Production value is decent. The movie is not unduly long.Randhir Kapoor had not allowed himself to be shadowed by his legendary father (Raj Kapoor) and carved a niche for himself in cine-world through his natural talent and sincere efforts. Haath Ki Safaai is one of his memorable movies which the typical Bollywood movie buffs will like for sure.\n",

I have had the opportunity to teach MBAs in New York Polytechnic and Rutgers, and can certify that this was a very real depiction of a Wall Street tycoon. Nothing over the top, calm, poised, confident. He genuinely plays the piano, and rendered the song with such elan and intensity it seemed he was a concert pianist.The movie had a relaxed but confident forward motion. I gave it a 9 because the heroine's dresses were over the top. Otherwise this was a 10.And I appreciated the director's not inserting cheesy villains or extending the story just because it had to be of a certain length. Its a pretty confident move to have both new leads, but this was a casting coup.Watch it with a glass of wine in your hand, and prepare to be transported.\n",

If you are looking for a break from the hectic life, watching this movie is exactly what you should be doing. It is a very balanced film having an apt mix of fun and emotions. The friendship between the four friends has been shown very nicely. The aura created through the scenes involving these friends is really fun- filled. It is a good movie and surely would cater to the tastes of both young and old. For the old, it is the best way to relive their good old times and, for the young, it is not just a source of entertainment but it also very aptly explains the situation that most of the youth is facing in today's time. The title Love Shagun and the tagline \"Dil Ki Ya Maa Ki\" very rightly describes the plot of the film. In my view, everyone should go and watch this film at least once.\n",

            "80s was the decade of silly and unoriginal films, though most of them dominated at the box office, some sank without a trace. Mad films came and some got good results while others fell flat. Even multistarrers like Khatron Ke Khiladi did good at the box office for being an entertainer. The truth is that film was fun to watch, but so typical and the action is hilarious, no realism. Ajay Kashyap was a director of the 80s and no he is not a good director. His direction was nothing close to perfection, he always heavily depended on the script(which is the worst part). This is mainly because his movies had stories that would make you cringe and turn off the television. Not sure about all of Kashyap's films but most of them were with Sanjay Dutt(who was very raw in most of his 80s films). Do Quadi released at the late 80s(pretty much 1989) when this decade was ending and Big B too was going through a bad phase with several disasters at the box office. Do Quadi was a flop at the box office, it is a typical movie with the same ingredients from most bollywood films from 80s and 90s decade. 2 robbers(arch enemies) work for the same mob boss, but the bosses son dislikes both the robbers and gets them in prison for an honest cop's murder. Both find out they work for the same man and escape from the prison van. The most hilarious and unintentionally funny scenes include Govinda and Sanju running chained to each other from the van. After many misunderstandings, both became friends(rivalry ends), and both avenge the honest cop and kill the villains. The story is nothing great, it is typical. Though it is better than most Kashyap films and definitely better than Kashyap's delayed film Do Matewale which bombed at the box office. The movie is extremely clichéd, there are many questions definitely puzzle one's mind. Why did their rivalry end like that, sudden friendship is odd and clichéd. Why does the son of the mob boss hate them so much, they do the jobs properly. In fact, why does Manu and Kanu hate each other so much, the background information is lacking. There is no valid reason for so much hatred. The action sequences are average, some of them are made by some of them are hilarious. Plus, the prison van escape scene is stupidity at its height. Songs are all fillers, nothing special. Heroines are there mainly for the songs and some romantic boring dialogs which all typical Bollywood movies need. Sanju and Govinda have good chemistry together and their dialogs are one of the things to check out. Though Sanju is raw, his acting has improved from some of his worst movies after his debut Rocky and super hit multistarrer Vidhaata. On the whole, Do Quadi is one of those films which flopped at the box office, though it flopped, compared to other Kashyap films, it is actually decent. Even for being such a mad clichéd film, it is good compared to craps Kashyap made like Mere Haque and Do Matewale.\n",

Also it's full of humour with all the five city thugs(who usually played villains)adjusting to the village life n' customs creating some hilarious situations.All in all one of the best Curry Western's ever made and it predates Sholay!\n",

Unfortunately the movie had nothing fresh or novel to offer. Neither a different insight in to the institution of marriage was presented. This movie does not hold against movies like 'Anuranan' or even 'Life Partner'. All actors performed well. But with a lame script there was no substance in the plot. There was a lot of potential to progress the plot towards slapstick situations. Mandira Bedi gets the opportunity to act in another movie, but she is wasted.

            "Pratikaar review :Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit was a always superhit pair starting from Tezaab (1988) right upto the recent Total Dhamaal (2019). However, Pratikaar, an Independence day weekend release of 1991, couldn't succeed at the box office despite the two stars in the lead. Remade from its namesake Bengali movie, the film revolves around Kapoor who avenges the humiliation of his mother Rakhee and gangrape of his sister Amita Nangia by three goons played by Mahesh Anand, Tej Sapru and Manek Irani (better known as Billa!!).Surprisingly, the movie is memorable today for Mahesh Anand's oft repeated punchline \"Hum Roop nagar ke cheeteh hain. Shikaar par hi jeete hain\". This dialogue was a smash hit amongst the shaitaan type school kiddos of our time.In one of his later interviews, Anil Kapoor admitted signing the film to fund his home production Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1993). Madhuri too came on board for director T. Rama Rao whom she wanted to work with. Special mention of Mohsin Khan and Sonu Walia who were largely left out from the movie publicity and promotions and even their roles were slashed in the final edit.Pratikaar took a decent opening at Badal Bijlee Cinema where I saw it but crashed from Monday onwards to emerge a massive flop at the box office. Today, not many people would remember the movie name but just say the dialogue \"Hum Roop nagar ke cheeteh hai...\" and it will be an instant connect!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "All the music lovers who are fond of listening to old Hindi songs, must have listened to a classic romantic song sung by Lata Mangeshkar - 'Aapki Nazron Ne Samjha Pyar Ke Kaabil Mujhe, Dil Ki Ae Dhadkan Thahar Ja, Mil Gayi Manzil Mujhe'. This song is from the movie - Anpadh (1962) starring Maala Sinha, Dharmendra, Balraaj Saahni and Bindu in lead roles.Anpadh (illiterate) is the story of Laajwanti (Maala Sinha) who is the sister of a rich landlord Chaudhary Shambhunaath (Balraaj Saahni). The excess affection that she got in her parental house resulted in her remaining illiterate and lacking knowledge of household work also. She gets married to Deepak (Dharmendra) who is a very loving husband. However her not knowing the household chores does not go well with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. She suffers taunts in this regard but her husband's love compensates for them.However the sudden demise of Deepak in a mishap brings utter misfortune for Laajwanti. Her mother-in-law expels her from the house when she is pregnant. Right now her brother also cannot support her because he has been sentenced to imprisonment because of committing a murder due to a property dispute. Helpless Laajwanti finds it very difficult to survive in the cruel world especially because she is illiterate and not trained for any job to earn a living.But as there are wicked ones in this world, kind ones too. Once Laajwanti comes across good-hearted people after going through many troubles, her life starts recovering. She gives birth to a daughter and fosters her. She herself learns how to read and write as well as the work of stitching clothes and thereby makes a living. Her daughter grows up as Kiran (Bindu). Now comes the final twist in the tale when in order to save her daughter's honour from a rapist, Laajwanti commits a murder and on the murder spot itself, she meets her lost elder brother Chaudhary Shambhunaath after a gap of several years. The movie ends after an interesting courtroom drama.Anpadh was made during the early sixties when female education was not stressed in the Indian society. Even the girls of wealthy and high profile families were not getting sufficient education and getting them married in respectable families upon their getting adult was only considered as fulfillment of duty towards them by their parents / guardians. And this situation continued long after that. Hence this movie is to be seen, felt and experienced in the context of the period of its making. Then only it can be enjoyed.Anpadh is a highly entertaining movie with regular twists in the narrative keeping the spectator glued to the screen. The demise of the hero before the interval point is disappointing but it was required for the script. This family and social drama is woman-centric and the heroine remains at the nucleus of the complete narrative right from the very start to the very finish.More than the romantic angle of the hero and the heroine, it's the brother-sister angle between two lead characters which has got more footage and importance. The affectionate brother does not care for his sister's education due to remaining under an impression that his wealth won't allow any such situation that his sister needs to work somewhere to earn a living. But times change. And he realizes his mistake much later when destiny has ruined everything for his delicately fostered (in the parental house) sister. The sister misses her brother very much especially in her time of crisis. This emotional angle is able to touch the hearts of all the loving brothers and sisters.The taunting mother-in-law and sister-in-law have always been a fond stuff for the Bollywood filmmakers and mostly they are over the top with the poor daughter-in-law standing like a lamb before them. However the audience of such family dramas is used to seeing such things.This black and white movie is technically OK. Music composed by Madan Mohan is the highlight of this movie. In addition to Aapki Nazron Ne Samjha, songs like Woh Dekho Jala Ghar Kisi Ka, Hai Isi Mein Pyar Ki Aabroo, Jiya Le Gayo Ji Mora Saanwariya, Rang Birangi Raakhi Le Ke Aayi Behna etc. are also real gems from the treasure of Hindi cine music. All these songs are considered among Lata's best renditions. Raja Mehndi Ali Khan has penned the beautiful lyrics which boast of high literary value.It's Maala Sinha's movie by all means and right from a young unmarried girl to the aged mother of a grown up daughter, she has excelled in her performance. Very young Dharmendra has got a low footage role but he has done his part well. Seasoned actor Balraaj Saahni has delivered his best whereas it's a pleasant surprise to see the renowned screen cabaret dancer of the seventies - Bindu (who is very young in this movie) to see in a decent role. The classical song - Jiya Le Gayo Ji Mora Saanwariya (based on Raag Yaman) has been filmed on her only.The issue of women education has got more and more prominence in later decades and today everybody understands its importance may he / she belong to the lower strata of the society or the middle one or the upper one. This way, Anpadh was ahead of its time and delivered a very pertinent message to the old fashioned Indian society as early as in 1962. I recommend this decent entertainer with a high music appeal and a significant message to all the Hindi movie buffs.\n",

It was released in 1971, and I'm reviewing it in 2020 and to my amazement all the characters in the films are relatable and mirror images of our society.It is a simpleton tale of a struggling writer who challenges the perception of a richmen about poverty and low castes. It comprised of limited characters, but magnificently explored throughout the film. To me, all the dialogues were Ironic and all actors delivered brilliantly especially Dharmendra, Pran, Mehmood, and Ashok Kumar.If I talk about acting then everyone justified their roles. Dharmendra was mature and realistic, he has some powerful dialogues which can still lit the crisis of our society. Pran was deadliest, meanest man ever. Mehmood has varied emotions and he delivered it perfectly. Hema Malini was an array of beauty, she acted well in most parts of the film. To me, Ashok Kumar was the surprise package. This is the first time I watched him perform, he has blown me away with his natural acting.Music is classy, Anand Bakhsi lyrics have powerful meanings. \"Duniya O Duniya\" and \"Naya Zamaana Aayega\" will be added to my playlist.\"Naya Zamaana\" is a classical cinema, the kind of story which is a story of millions of people who are hopeful for a better time to live in this world.

Unfortunate part is that movies are getting repeated and outdone and the essence of the flavor is dying. Besharam tries hard to entertain you but falls flat on the face.Besharam tells the story of a car thief who had to steal back the car he sold to a gang-lord after he falls in love with a girl whose car he stole. From the critically and commercial acclaimed director of Dabangg, much was expected from Abhinav Kashyap but the lousy direction , insensible screenplay and terrible story gives you a headache which you never asked especially from star like Ranbir Kapoor. There is no plot here and frequent insertion of songs just spoils the entire mood of the film. Music is a complete letdown. Art direction and cinematography is decent. Ranbir Kapoor disappoints big time. For the first time in his career , he does not do justice to his role. The new-comer Pallavi Sharda is wasted. The chemistry between her and Ranbir Kapoor is terrible which is very much required in this kind of film. The only saving grace are comic relief by Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor who are good but not great. Overall, Besharam is loud, lousy and unconvincing.

I hav noticed in majority bollywood films that the male n female leads cannot act. How come they r made actors i cannot fathom. It looks like these so called actors finance their own films. These male n female actors from bollywood r jus paying attention to looks, muscular body n dancing. These r not the requirements to b a good actor. Apart from the guy from Dangal (he is the best actor in bollywood), i haven't come across a decent actor. Maybe i need to watch more bollywood movies. Terrible actors, awful film n pathetic direction.\n",

            "It takes something to make such a movie... great direction, I would say. There are periods of silence, there are talks and the talks actually take the time they would have taken in real life. The story is simple. A simple family of three, middleclass, the wife saving money to get a house of their own, and this saving is at times on the cost of little pleasures and conveniences in life. In the meantime the husband finds another girl who comes as a perfect soulmate. They start sharing a close relationship, a closeness that one ever achieves in reality, a closeness where both share the same emotional, psychological and philosophical grounds. And then comes the obvious... a dilemma for the husband, distance between him and his wife growing and an unclear status for the other female. And then he decides to tell his wife and leave her...A must see for all the people who believe relationships go beyond spending time together. Its a real slow movie, and rather than focussing on what happens, the idea is to involve oneself in feeling the moments that make a relationship grow.\n",

            "That's Rishi Kapoor's role in this film, which is not a very good film but still entertaining to an extent. The story revolves around what happens when his character Amrit is mistaken for a wealthy man named Mr. Sinha's son in-law. Sinha opposed to his daughter Juhi's marriage to a man named Vijay, and she left home. Years later, when Juhi already had a son, Sinha started missing his daughter and asked her to come back. On her way to visit her father, Juhi's husband is killed in a train accident, and Juhi disappears. The little kid is found alive and Amrit is brought to Sinha's house, mistaken for Vijay. From then on begins a chain of lies, and Amrit cannot reveal his true identity because it could kill Sinha. At that time he falls for Juhi's younger sister Reshmi. But some time later, Juhi is returned home, and she is diagnosed with temporary amnesia. That's the basic story of the movie, and it is an okay 80s fare, which would be enjoyed by lovers of Hindi cinema only. The dialogues, the proceedings and almost everything else in the movie wavers between good and bad. The only thing that is consistent in it is the music. R.D Burman creates another brilliant soundtrack which gives the film a certain charm the script did not manage to give. Songs like \"Jeevan Ke Din\" and \"Kahin Na Jaa\" are classics. Rishi Kapoor is quite good in his leading role. Tina Munim is lovely and hot. Pran is good as usual, so is Amjad Khan, and Sarika is wonderful as Juhi. Bade Dilwala is an average movie but it has its moments, and the music is, as said, excellent.\n",

            "There is one, and only one cardinal mistake that Meerabai Not Out commits - it trivializes the national passion. Someone had a smart sounding idea of exploiting cricket as a plot device for a love story with the depth of half a soap episode. Mandira Bedi, after her sacrilegious cricket exploits on the small screen now does it on the silver screen as Meera Achrekar, the cricket fanatic who has a huge crush on Anil Kumble and is about to marry a doctor. But will cricket be the 'significant other'? That question almost wrecks a relationship, that going by the flow of the script, looked flimsy to begin with. And for those eagerly waiting to see Kumble's cameo don't even bother (Jumbo says to Meera at one point 'You look like Mandira Bedi!' - Did the writer lose his sense of humor there or his mind? Hard to tell!). Mercifully, unlike one of those drab days of test cricket on a dead subcontinent pitch, Meerabai Not Out is a short umcomedy, love story, sports movie, dramawhatever! And there are about 180 seconds worth watching. Pity, like stray deliveries from Anil Kumble, they are few and very far between.\n",

            "Seventies was an era of unemployment crisis was so palpable and corruption and favors of politicians rules in job interviews. All those hopeless lost generation of jobless educated youth took solace as socialist rebel. They just smoke, do whatever is available and kill their time.Written & Directed by K Balachander, the film portrays the life of a bunch of three jobless bachelors living strugglers' life in Delhi. The film is woven with satirical humor and captures delicately the everyday reality of that era. Watch fake lunch scene full of overacting. Some of the dialogues penned by none other than Gulzar are really so ironic and striking one to the scenes depicting reality. For example every time a man tries to post his application/postal order into the postbox, he heard sarcastic laughter sound inside the postbox. In another scene all three guys were sitting on road pavement with hunger in stomach and struggling for money and above them we see the huge signboard saying 'Have you paid your Income Tax?' Wow what a contrast!!! These are just few examples, there are many such brilliant sarcasm running throughout the film.Where most of the Directors often highlighted either the melodrama or light comedy while dealing with such a subject, K Balachander had kept the spirit of both of them alive in right proportions and that's make the film a fine sensible and sensitive watch. Perhaps he would have made some more such films in Hindi!!! Kamal Hasan has done a few films in Hindi and this one is hardly remembered by anyone but as a jobless struggler poet and hater of hypocrisy, he once again gave his well nuanced performance here. Perhaps a few people of today's generation know about Marathi actor Nilu Phule who almost did the negative roles of street gambler, drunkard in so many films. Watch him here in one of his fine act of good for nothing scornful father and I bet any other actor can do justice to it. Actress Anita Raj ruled in 80's B graders revenge flicks but here she too is so natural and average. The only unfortunate parts of the film are its last half an hour which is quite stereotype and dragging one and the other is music. LP failed to score the magic of memorable melodies they composed in Balachander-Kamal's blockbuster hit 'Ek Duje Ke Liye'.Recommended to all sensible cinelovers.\n",

And this is a story of one such lover, Karanvir Bohra (Dhruv), who takes his obsession way too far, and all too soon.Set in a hill station, this film's plot traces the journey of Dhruv, a simple bookstore and café owner, who falls in love with a renowned novelist Ananya Tripathi (Priya Banerjee). But soon after, things go downhill.Dhruv's impulsive actions set the mood of the story. The film is a drama with suspense and thrills, but it is predictable, hence, failing to keep you on the edge of the seat.Karanvir Bohra is effective and plays his part convincingly.Overall, 'Hume Tumse Pyaar Kitna' is a few decades too late, as it reminds you of the era when Bollywood romanticised tales of creepily obsessive lovers.The climax, too, falls flat and the film offers nothing that you have not seen before in this genre.Boy meets girl, he falls madly in love with her. He stalks her, harasses her and does everything and anything he possibly can to complete his love story.Apart from a few thrills, the film gives you nothing new to get entertained.\n",

            "This film is about an accidental separation of a young couple. The general portrayal of the story is fine, but the film is marred by several problems of credibility and overblown emotions. How can Rajesh Khanna's and Shabana's son be so mature at 14, fighting with other guys like a superman (my least favourite scene in the film shortly before the end of the film), romancing a young girl and singing a song with her (the voice of the singer who sings for him is way ahead of the boy's age).There are scenes which are realistic and charming, but there are such which are overdone and unconvincing. The character of Urmila Bhatt is an extremely irritating one, and she is plastic with her cliché dialogues and victimising attitude.Otherwise the film is nice. Rajesh Khanna and Shabana Azmi act well and some of their scenes together are pure magic. Azmi in particular is interesting; considering the fact that she is known for her realistic films, it's a pleasant paradox watching her in an unrestrained melodramatic mainstream film (she did many such films, but it's still engaging).The music is good, the cinematography is fine, the locations and the urban settings are well chosen.Watch it, but be prepared to get mixed feelings about it.\n",

Other actors like Paintal & Shakti Kapoor have done well in their respective roles.Dialogs of this film are good.

            "Before watching CHARGESHEET and then daringly going for reviewing it, one has to keep in mind that this is not a film from an ordinary man of our Indian Film Industry. In fact this is a film from one of the most dashing personalities of his times for whom girls used to go for unbelievable extremes in those golden days of his youth. A creative person who has been associated with more than one films which are all now considered among the Best Movies made in Indian Cinema till date including GUIDE, JEWEL THIEF, HARE RAMA HARE KRISHNA, TERE MERE SAPNE & many more.The man, popularly known as DEV ANAND, is now enjoying his life, doing all the things he loves in a wonder age of 88. It's nothing other than a miracle that a person is conceiving, writing, producing, directing and even acting in his own film at the age of 88. Honestly speaking I haven't seen anyone doing such kind of work at this age, in my own life ever. And for that I simply salute DEV ANAND saab for his undying working spirit and his true love for cinema.But talking about the movie CHARGESHEET, which can be vaguely termed as an attempted murder mystery, I would like to describe it in a different way. Considering the fact that it is a result of an 88 years old veteran, ideally the film cannot, should not and need not be reviewed in the usual manner from any angle. But lets understand this statement in the following manner.We all have our beloved old age elders in our houses, dealing with the harsh realities of life wherein their physical faculties are on a continuous decline. We all immensely love them and try to comfort them through every possible means to the best of our abilities. But this old age brings along its own complexities, which in one way can also be considered beautiful as it's a stage where a person again tends to move back in his childhood and becomes a child. Many a times, very old people do certain things or indulge in certain activities which are simply beyond any logic, just like an innocent child's act. They often seem to be in a different world altogether expressing their thoughts through some strange unexplainable poetry or writings which are both insightful and weird at the same time.But we never mind any of their such childish activities at all because deep inside, we know that its not their own fault, as that's actually the old age which is playing its games at the back of their mind. So, knowing the truth, we even love them more in that particular period and try to keep them happy most of the times fulfilling their every little wish like a child.Relating the above fact with the subject here, I would like to say that though it might sound as a bitter reality to many but if truth be said, DEV ANAND's all movies in the recent years are just like a result of some strange imagination of a child-like old man with a powerful spirit of keep on working. An old child of 88 who simply refuses to sit at home playing with his grand children and instead decides to go on making numerous, un-noticeable, extremely weak films, quite similar to the doodles done by children in their school books when they get bored in their daily classes.So even when his latest film CHARGESHEET gave me a real tough time in the theater with everything proving way below the minimum levels of a normal film-making style, still, I refused to move out of the theater just for the sake of this Spirited Old Man called DEV ANAND.For me, his current and all his recent movies are nothing more than a Loving Old Man's ROUGH DOODLES written on the white screen through the medium of a camera, which literally remain meaningless if taken as a film experience. But even then, I truly did not mind seeing it, since it was the outcome of all that hard work done by a creative personality heroically making movies at the age of 88.No, as a true reviewer, I cannot recommend my readers to go for this movie in the theaters in any case, but as a creative person myself I would like to end this write-up with an honest wish that \"If in case I am granted a long life reaching the age of 88, I would readily like to spend all those years working on the projects I love, exactly like DEV ANAND Saab is doing at this moment and I would simply love to die on one of my working days.\"My respect, towards the unbelievable, undying spirit of this man called DEV ANAND.\n",

The worst example of first timer direction, I can actually point out the flaws where the director could have improved this movie to another level. 1. The Director failed to create the Curiosity in the viewers in the first half of the movie about the so called 'Project' the boys really want to go for 2. The sequence of the Tiger was pathetic, one could easily make out the screen color difference in the two separate shots 3. Why would the boys want to stay in the Forest another night without any reason when they already started off back to their jeep as they easily reached in a while from Jeep to Temple 4. The shots where 'Sunny' gets scared of nothing, where did his friends go away all of a sudden when they were all together in the previous shot. 5. In the same sequence, First Shot appears to be the evening time, Second Shot is they are sitting near the bon-fire, Third shot from a distance again appears to be the evening time without anything dark around, how bad it could be 6. The 'Dummy Images' part in the morning was unbelievably poor 7. and the climax, the two friends just vanished and the hero is alive and well without any scratch the next day he comes back to the forest to discover that his friends might have jumped the cliff over, give me a break!I would really suggest Jimmy not to do just any movies comes his way, be thoughtful man and don't experiment on your career. To be very honest, the performance of other two friends of Sunny was much more realistic and convincing than him.\n",

In the movie, Sundar Sehgal (Krishan Kumar) was an all rounder , who wanted to become a great cricketer like his father. As he was moving ahead towards his goal, then a girl, Sheetal (Shilpa Shirodkar) comes in his life. Her entry & the professional rivalry with a fellow mate, Gautam. Sagar turns everything upside down. He lost his mother, killed his own lover, Sheetal for which he was imprisoned. Mamta (Shilpa Shirodkar, double role ) who resembles Sheetal was the daughter of Jailer (Kiran Kumar) . She tries and succeeds in finding the real truth behind the conspiracy with the help of Onkar ( Asrani ). In the concluding part of the movie, we come to know that Sagar had conspired everything. He was the person behind Sheetal's denial of marriage proposal and killing her. Knowing the truth, Sundar's spirit leaves his body. I give 7 out of 10 for this flick. The movie had some unnecessary characters in it but Kishan k and his acting was outstanding. And again - Sonu, Udit Narayan have given few awesome songs which one will listen again and again in their life. The double role from the actress was outstanding.

            "Director Rohit Shetty started his popular Golmaal series in the year 2006 and presented the second movie of this series titled as Golmaal Returns in 2008. The movie was a big hit on the box office. However its plot was by no means original. Gomlaal Returns is actually a remake of an old Bollywood comedy - Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar (1973).Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar (today's breaking news) is the story of Sunil (Kiran Kumar) and his ever-suspicious wife - Geeta (Raadha Saluja) who thinks that her husband is a flirt. One night Sunil unwillingly gets stuck up with a stranger lady and could return to his home the next morning only. Considering his wife's skeptical nature, he hesitates to tell her the truth and instead, cooks a story with the help of his friend Amit (Asraani) to serve to Geeta to convince her regarding his absence from home for that night. The story contains a fake friend of his named by him as Champak Bhumiya and his fictitious address where he claims to have spent that night. However the situation takes a very interesting turn when Geeta sends a telegram to that imaginary Champak Bhumiya at the address told to her by Sunil and all hell breaks loose when the telegram reaches its destination which is a genuine address and there is a genuine Champak Bhumiya (Paintal) residing at that address. These developments result in a lot of confusion, misunderstandings and laughs (for the audience). Finally, all's well that ends well.Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar starts hilariously with a henpecked husband and his nagging wife and thereafter the twists and turns coming at regular intervals keep the interest of the viewer alive till the climax. Laughs may not be in plenty but there is no dearth of smiles here. It may not be a great comedy but a satisfactory entertainer for sure. And there is a message for the ever-suspicious wives also (who perceive their husband as regular flirts and skirt-chasers) that such kind of attitude without any concrete basis may prove fatal for the marital bliss of themselves only.This is a low budget movie with a middle class milieu rendered to the story. Technically it's okay as far as the art direction, the cinematography and the editing are concerned. Background score and dialogs are also in line with the comic mood of the movie.Kiran Kumar who perhaps got his true calling in the villainous roles during the eighties and the nineties, had started his career as a hero and this movie is one of those flicks in which he was cast as the hero. He possessed a handsome personality and it's unfortunate that he could not become a successful hero. He has done well here because he has always been a good actor. Raadha Saluja may not appear to be a heroine material to today's viewers considering her ordinary looks but she was a good actress. And frankly, if Mallika Sherawat can be a successful heroine, why couldn't Raadha who was, in many ways, better than Mallika and her likes. Seasoned comedians Asraani and Paintal have generated laughs for the audience, coming true to their reputation in that period. All the other cast members have also done justice to the assigned roles.Shankar Jaikishan's music is strictly okay. Only one song - Mujhe Meri Biwi Se Bachaao remains in the memory after the movie is over. This song, filmed on Kiran Kumar when he is bathing in the bathroom, is very good to listen and very amusing to watch. Decades later, the words of this song were used as the title of a movie starring Nasiruddin Shah and Rekha (released in 2001).Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar badly flopped on the box office whereas its newer version Golmaal Returns proved to be a huge commercial hit. Well, hype and publicity matter more in today's time. While recommending this movie as a decent watch to the entertainment-seekers, I also advise those who have seen Golmaal Returns to contrast these two movies. I am sure that like me, they will also find Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar as better than Golmaal Returns.\n",

            "The first episode focused on the issue of female foeticide in India. The show began with some stories of mothers who struggled to give birth to their girl child. The first guest on the show was Amisha Yagnik from Ahmedabad. Yagnik was forced by her husband and in-laws to abort her female unborn children six times in a span of eight years and further shared her experiences in finally giving birth to a daughter. The second guest, Parveen Khan from Morena, Madhya Pradesh shared the story of her husband disfiguring her face by biting it, when she insisted on giving birth to a female child against his wishes. Another guest, doctor Mitu Khurana from Delhi was asked by her orthopaedic surgeon husband and in-laws to abort her girl twins 20 weeks after conceiving. Her story helped dispel the perception and myth among people that the abhorrent practice of female foeticide is practised only by rural people or those living in small towns or is confined only to lesser educated people.The show claimed that according to 2011 Census, the rate at which the unborn female child is killed amounts to killing off 1,000,000 girls a year and there were 914 girls for every 1,000 boys.The show focuses on sensitive social issues prevalent in India such as female foeticide, child sexual abuse, rape, honour killings, domestic violence, untouchability, alcoholism, and the criminalization of politics. It aims to bring the great achievements of people which often go unnoticed in order to encourage the audience to achieve their goals no matter what comes in between. It also aims to empower citizens with information about their country, and urge them to take action.\n",

            "This movie echoes the theme of another Dilip Kumar starrer under the Chopra banner, Naya Daur (New Road), the theme being the need for capital to respect the contribution of labour and not exploit it. In this movie Dilip Kumar throws in his job when he joins other workers in funeral of a worker killed in an industrial accident, and the management wants to dock their wages. What happens next is that Kumar builds his own mill on the basis of social justice.The romantic element involves the poor textile engineer taken in and virtually adopted as a son by Dilip Kumarwhose daughter, played by Padmini Kolhapure, falls for, while he has fallen for a rich girl.An enjoyable movie because of the strong performance by Kumar, who brings his trademark intensity to the role, and because of the reminder of days when Hindi cinema could produce movies that questioned the status quo, and not just endorsed it, as in the recent crop of movies set among mega-rich NRIs in New York and Canada.\n",

            "Many films in the Hindi film industry have been made about and centred around happy families who lose their happiness. So many that there could be a genre of its own called \"The 'happy-family-destroyed' drama\". Pyar Ka Mandir is a relatively good movie in this category because the values in this family are very strong, and unsurprisingly, the children are those who ruin this happiness. It's a very wide disease in our world: when parents are no longer needed, the children reveal their true characters. But not Mithun Chakraborty's Vijay, who has such an unconditional love for his siblings and his beloved mother that he sacrifices his own happiness for his family and gets jailed. When he comes back, he finds out that his house, \"The Temple of Love\", no longer exists. When he meets his brothers, he is shocked at their attitude towards him and does not manage to meet his mom, who is absent. Then the story of his struggle begins and takes more shape.The film, though generally well narrated, suffers from a very overdone, unrealistic and melodramatic portrayal and very often the development of the story is marred by several unnecessary subplots and many ridiculous jokes with Kader Khan's role of an idiotic and forgetful doctor. Nevertheless, Laxmikant-Pyarelal compose a lovely soundtrack and Kader Khan's dialogues are not bad though a bit over-the-top. Mithun gives a sincere performance. His transformation from a happy-go-lucky guy to a serious and sad man is believable. Nirupa Ray is outstanding as the initially strict and then suffering mother. Madhavi is beautiful though a little too angry as the headstrong and unconditionally loving Radha. Other cast members are good but don't make as much an impact so I won't mention them. There are two consecutive scenes which moved me: the one when Vijay finally meets his mother and finds her in indescribable conditions, and the following scene when Vijay reproaches his ungrateful brothers. Pyar Ka Mandir is not a fantastic film, but it's definitely moving and well-intentioned.\n",

Sanjay Dutt is brilliant as usual as the killer who turns good, then bad and good. Juhi Chawla was the 90s sex symbol and she does OK in this film. Bhanupriya is a south Indian actress who is beautiful for her age. A simple storyline set in a town where gangs like to collect protection money.

            "Manmohan Singh's 'Pehla Pehla Pyar' (a.k.a. First First Love) is pretty much the typical Bollywood fairy tale from the 90s. A naive and spoilt Princess Sapna (Tabu) runs away from her mansion, which is under the strict supervision of her stepmother and a greedy uncle (Amrish Puri). On the way, she meets a fat aspiring musician (Rishi Kapoor). After some supposed comedic banters they fall in love. Things take a turn once princess Sapna returns to her mansion. Stepmom and evil Uncle have a scheme. Cute Tabu definitely looks and acts the part but her costumes are quite funny. What's even (unintentionally) funnier than her absurd costumes is Rishi Kapoor's dance. His steps and lack of grace is one of the most amusing parts of 'Pehla Pehla Pyar'. Kader Khan provides some nice comic relief and the late Amrish Puri entertains again as a villain. The soundtrack is fairly good (for a 90s Bollywood soundtrack). The songs are upbeat and catchy even though the lyrics exaggerate. Anyway, 'Pehla Pehla Pyar' doesn't offer anything new but it is fun in a campy sort of way and Tabu looks adorable and hot.\n",

            "Bandhe Hath review :Released a few months before Amitabh Bachchan became a sensation with Zanjeer (1973), Bandhe Hath is one of his lesser known films with OP Ralhan helming it (producer/actor/ ghost director) and Mumtaz as his co-star.The plot revolves around a thief (Bachchan) wanting to turn a new leaf and assuming the identity of his doppelganger writer (Double role) who dies in an unfortunate incident. Posing as the writer, Amitabh falls in love with the dancer Mumtaz until his past comes to haunt him in form of a tough cop (Ajit) on his trail.OP Ralhan's execution was not too bad but the major issue here was lack of chemistry between Amitabh and Mumtaz. By early '70s, Mumu was an established star and Bachchan, a newbie with multiple flops in his kitty, looked stiff in front of her. His performance was quite good, mind you, but his scenes with the gorgeous Mumu lacked spark!!Bandhe Hath was rejected by the audience in the first run but once Zanjeer released, it picked up business in some centres and did much better in re-runs. Amitabh's fans must watch it (in case they haven't) for experiencing the time when he wasn't \"Big B\" yet!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "We rented this movie on the spur of the moment as we hardly ever watch any pre-Sholay Amitabh films. This film is interesting because one can see the seeds of the all-too-famous \"angry young man\" character, however, this time that rebellious nature is channeled against parental authority. Amitabh plays a passionate poet (a la Kabhi Kabhi) who has no intention of basking in his poetic grandeur and whose lawyer father keeps insisting that he find a professional job. One day while walking through the streets he hears his poem being sung by Jaya Bhaduri's \"kotewalli\" character and is immediately mesmerized by her passion. He goes to tell her of his appreciation but masks the fact that he is the original poet of the song. She dislikes his tongue-in-cheek bad-mouthing of the poet and so starts an unlikely courtship. Amitabh's father is angered that his son would try to ruin his social standing by frequenting such a place but Amitabh quite resolutely argues for the freedom of love devoid of social chains. Jaya's mother (Nadira) is also angered by the growing relationship between the two because the very nature of a \"kotewali\" entails projecting an air of aloofness and temptation which can never be attained. What angers her more is the fact that Jaya keeps refusing the invitation of a very rich and powerful nawab.What could have been a typical young-lovers-whose-parents-don't-understand love story is undercut by the intelligence through which Amitabh is able to articulate his love for Jaya, avoiding stock characterizations of the parental figures, and the investigative/courtroom angle represented by Raza Murad. Never before have I seen him in such a powerful role and it's a sad feeling considering the poor roles he was offered later in life. Murad's intelligent lawyer who spends his entire day in his room reading whatever he can get his hands on is the epitome of the ideal lawyer-one who fights for the cause of truth, and in this case, on Jaya's behalf when she is framed for a murder she didn't commit.Who the original killer is, the motive for this murder, and the ties which links all these characters together is developed and brought to light with breath-taking pacing and suspense. In fact, instead of having the motives for the murder displayed in a heated courtroom battle, it is instead told through the use of pen drawings and water-colour paintings with Murad's voiceover. A truly stunning work of cinematic creativity. Coupled with the intelligent script, excellent camera framing and editing, and characterizations, Ek Nazar is a must see for Amitabh fans who grew up watching the \"angry young man\" and want to see his delicate acting prowess.\n",

            "Ehsaas (feeling) is the story of a widower - Ravi (Sunil Shetty) who could not fulfil his dream to become an ace athlete but now wants his son - Rohan (Master Mayank Tandon) to fulfil that and get everything in his life which he (the father) could not get. For this purpose, he behaves with him like a strict disciplinarian without caring for the fact that his harsh attitude is taking his little son mentally away from him. The child, Rohan has started disliking his father and a rift has propped between the father and the son which is not known to the loving father. A divorcée lady, Antara (Neha) lives in the neighbourhood of Ravi with her mother (Kiran Kher) and though she has a liking in her heart for Ravi (in addition to her affection for little Rohan), she does not approve of the highly strict approach of his towards Rohan. Ravi is training Rohan for a race and arranging all the requisite facilities and equipments for him despite his limited earnings and financial resources. Ravi's dream of seeing his son winning the race is shattered with an accident of Rohan. Firstly, Ravi is misunderstood by both his son as well as Antara. However Rohan realizes his father's love for him and he reciprocates it by participating in the race despite his injury. He is not able to win the race but the heart of his proud father. The ending scene unites Ravi and Antara also when both of them realize their love for each other and the pain they would feel if distanced from each other.Ehsaas is the movie of Mahesh Manjrekar whose maiden directorial venture - Vaastav (1999) was a box office hit and fetched best actor awards for Sanjay Dutt. After that formula-based movie, Mahesh Manjrekar directed some low budget but down-to-earth, realistic and touching movies. Ehsaas is one of them. It was not a box office grosser. However this simple movie is touching and lovable. The father-son relationship is the premise of the movie and the coconut like character of the father (hard when looked from outside but very soft inside) is heart-conquering. By my own experience, I know that a loser always wants his progeny to be a winner in his / her life and that's how I am able to relate to the character and the story. No loving father wants his son / daughter to come across the losses, deprivations and frustrations that he has undergone in his life.The movie emphatically underscores this fact that despite the love for the child and a desire for the betterment of his / her life, the parents have to understand child psychology and mould their own approach and behaviour according to the situation and try to avoid hurting the feelings of the little one. A child may not be mature enough to understand your intentions but you should be mature enough to understand his feelings. Military-like discipline is good for long run but demonstrating your love and affection for the child is equally important. Understand him / her, lest he / she should misunderstand you.Through the indirect and unspoken love of Ravi and Antara for each other, the director has demonstrates the human aspect of life with finesse. Saying 'I love you' is not required (it appears stupid also for mature people) but it's better if the sentiment is conveyed through gestures at least. Ravi feels his love for Antara when she is about to depart for US, thinking that Ravi will always remain ignorant of her feelings. The happy ending tells that small joys are always scattered around us which can be turned into big ones by ourselves.The climax in which Rohan participates in the race despite being physically unfit, is quite impressive and touching. The director has kept the movie realistic by showing that injured Rohan is not able to win or complete it though he could have gone for a filmy climax by showing him as winning it. I admire his better sense which has kept this movie down-to-earth and reliable.The production value of this low budget and simple movie is bound to be modest. However technically, the movie is good. The cinematographer has captured the real life of the countryside of Goa (where the story is set) and the natural beauty prevailing there fantastically. Editing is also good though the length of the ending scene could have been curtailed.Whatever may be people's opinion about Sunil Shetty, I have always been his admirer. He has delivered a very impressive performance in the role of the father who dreams big for his son but hides his true love from him and allows his strict and disciplinarian form only to appear before him. Master Mayank as the little son is equally impressive who finally comes to realize his father's love for him and then demonstrates to him that his love for the father is in no way any less. Neha, Kiran Kher, Shivaji Satam, Sanjay Narvekar, Rakhi Sawant etc. all have quite done admirably to support the father-son duo.Anand Raj Anand's music is good. In my opinion, Yeh Kaisa Ehsaah Hai sung by Sonu Nigam and Sunidhi Chauhan is the best from the album. However the other songs are also good to listen (and feel if you pay attention to the lyrics). The songs of this movie were not chartbusters but listening to them provides a soothing experience to the listener's heart.Ehsaas is an out and out simple movie sans all the formulae viz. romance, comedy, action etc. Hence this sentimental movie is not for those who like to see larger than life characters and situations on the screen.It's for sentimental people like me. I recommend this a decade old underrated movie to the viewers liking emotional family dramas and willing to learn something about fostering of the children.\n",

            "David Dhawan is known as the king of comedy because of his superhit comedy films from the 90s and 2000s but he actually started in the 1980s. David started with stereotypical action films which failed to work at the box office. Taaquatwar(1989) was his debut but he failed to make a successfully Masala potboiler. He directed other films which also flopped till Swarg(1990) his first hit. Dhawan wanted to cast action hero Sunny Deol in another one of his typical action films, Deol was ready and the film finished and released in 1990. What sucked for Deol and Dhawan was that this film flopped at the box office as well. Sunny took a lot of money from this film and David never signed him after this film.Aag Ka Gola(1990) is a typical action film where Sunny Deol plays a thief with a good heart. He always managed to successfully rob people but after one major robbery, he surrenders. He watches the mother of a child die and he remembers his devastating childhood. After leaving prison, Sunny wants to do something good in life but Prem Chopra(his old boss) won't let him slip off and Shakti Kapoor still suspects him to be a robber. Sunny starts working as a mechanic in a garage and he falls in love with Dimple Kapadia, both get married and have a son. Now, Sunny becomes a cop and he decides to destroy Prem Chopra who is still after him. The film goes on and on after which the climax happens. The end is typical where Sunny Deol dies and his son Deol also becomes an honest cop like him.The movie may be a typical action film but the handling by David is definitely up the mark. Many scenes are well handled, Sunny turning a new leaf, the comedy scenes in the garage, Sunny's frustration and Shakti's suspicion on Sunny. What backfires is a few parts like the forced romance between Sunny and Dimple, and a few songs which drag the film. The major flaw is how can Deol suddenly become a cop, but the on goings are well handled and the climatic battle is decent. Therefore, the direction by David Dhawan is actually decent.Sunny Deol does a good job but he was raw before Ghayal(1990), this film's failure must have disappointed him but Ghayal came and resurrected his flagging career. As usual Sunny does a good job with expressions and the action is a delight to watch. Dimple Kapadia is good even if her role only requires her to romance Sunny Deol. Her chemistry with Deol is good and she doesn't overact at any point. Prem Chopra is typecast as the main villain, he has done several roles like this before. Shakti Kapoor for once plays a positive role and he does a decent job, he doesn't ham. The rest provide decent support the film required.On the whole, Aag Ka Gola is a decent action film even if it's typical. The film may have flopped but that doesn't mean it was bad. The film isn't a masterpiece but it provides many decent moments and Dhawan handles the film quite well.\n",

Dino Morea didn't really have much of a role, so he was overlooked. Sanjay Suri had a bigger role, and he did a decent job. There are so many extraneous scenes that don't contribute anything to the movie. Oh, and the songs are awful. That is where the fast-forward button comes in handy.

            "It's quite saddening that among the overhyped pictures of the 1950s, many of which were, indeed wonderful, this extraordinary and unusual film went totally unnoticed. The film is in many ways ahead of its times in both story and execution. First it, it is based on a true story - adapted from the fifteenth-century travelogues of Russian merchant Afanasy Nikitin, whose character is the protagonist in this film. Secondly, being a co-production between India and USSR, way before the Alibabas and the Ajoobas, this one really showed with pure authenticity how these two cultures meet and how this sociocultural contact shapes up the behaviour of the people involved. Even beyond the idea of a scripted motion picture, just watching how the actors from such wildly distinct cultures work together is fascinating.The beauty of Pardesi lies in that it brings people together and celebrates humanity, which knows no language or boundaries. This is not to infer criticism on social identities and cultural differences, which are actually embraced here just as much. That's exactly the point of this film, the uniqueness of each cultural group does not come at the cost of the other. There isn't any attempt to suggest that equality means making everyone look or sound the same; on the contrary, true diversity is the desired state, and it is portrayed here with sheer honour. India is presented through an explorer's point of view, and Nikitin's story picks up when he meets and saves the life of a young Indian woman by the name of Champa. He is welcomed by her parents in their home, and a love story ensues, one that sadly and naturally can't be realised.The film was shot twice in two identical versions with mild alternations, where the Russian one (Journey Beyond the Three Seas; colourised today) digs deeper into his journey even before Nikitin reaches India (making its runtime longer by almost an hour). The last scene for instance in the Russian version is omitted from the Indian one, which is a shame considering how beautiful and meaningful it is. Sadly, the film is much less captivating as his stay in Champa's house is over, although the many familiar faces make for an interesting watch. Among the film's biggest flaws is the perfect communication between Nikitin and the Indian characters in what clearly should be cross-linguistic interaction. The film shows the characters to have no struggle speaking to foreign interlocutors as if they all speak one common language, which strains credulity.Nikitin, the man who likes travelling the world and meeting new people, is played by the Soviet actor Oleg Strizhenov in an excellent performance. Nargis is equally as good as Champa, infusing her character with vigor and poignancy. Padmini, an actress who is arguably one of the best dancers of Indian cinema, does exactly what one of the characters utters as she is dancing: speak through the gestures of her dance. Smaller appearances are offered by famous character actors including Prithviraj Kapoor, Achala Sachdev, Mamohan Krishan, and Balraj Sahni. Pardesi is an interesting film that deserves better familiarity among at least Indian audiences. It is not a great film, given its limitations and shortcomings, but it is a strong adventure with an unusual subject which I wish was tackled more. Definitely worth a watch.\n",

He was a film-Maker, who brought out the immense cultural diversity to the screen. \"Geet Gaya Pattharrone\" is a classic in Indian movies, that few have heard of. The movie, starred his daughter Rajshree, whose life in films was cut short by matrimony and she moved abroad after couple of more movies. One of them with Raj Kapoor called \"Around The World\". This movie was a debut for Jitendra, in a role that looked like he was on sedative! as compared to his later movies where he was the \"jumping jack!\" of Indian movies. Rajshree, was more a great dancer (born to dance)than an actress. The title song with the background of a beautiful melody and dance is a treat for the senses. There are some enchanting melodies so much so the movie DVD must be a treasure to own. This movie certainly was an embodiment of the dedication that the old filmmakers had towards their craft and the cast was selected based on talent. Rajshree, single-handedly opened the Indian fashion to the Western World. She was one of the classiest actress of the times and one has to see the movie to appreciate it.

            "I was pleasantly surprised and impressed to see a lead actress play such a strong role in an action-adventure movie of the 50s. Just a couple of weeks ago I was watching 'Kohinoor', another film of the 50s that falls in the same genre, where the heroine had a very clichéd damsel in distress. In 'Baaz' (falcon) where the heroine plays the title role, she is brave, strong, sensual, a skilled fighter and a good leader throughout the whole film. Even after she falls in love with the prince, she isn't 'tamed'. Then again, I shouldn't be so surprised as the female lead has always been a strong component of the one and only Guru Dutt's films.Speaking of the film, 'Baaz' is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However, some may feel that it's a little too anti-Portuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace, it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint, especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant (but it's funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies) and the choreography is mostly dazzling (for the fight scenes and the dances).Geeta Bali effortlessly pulls off Baaz/Nisha. Next to her firm screen presence, she fights, dances and of course acts very well. The charismatic Guru Dutt looks and acts like a prince and has the right chemistry with his heroine. Kuldip Kaur is over the top but funny at times. K.N. Singh is the evil general. Ruby Mayer is good too.'Baaz' is a great classic adventure film that can easily be enjoyed with the family around. This genre seems to be lost in the recent trend of Indian cinema. But hey, the classics are always there for us to revisit.\n",

            "I was amazed by this movie. I won't say too much to give away thought but this movie shows how ambition can become obsession. With the Indian film industry and the mob as a background, it also shows the struggle of those who want to make it big in the industry. It is Bollywood's best thriller so far! Full of suspense and great performances! I think Mahima Chaudhry is the only actress today who's done nothing but good work (and who's still struggling with success). Her movies are really full of surprises (and she also gives pleasantly surprising performances. It's a pity and a real shame on Bollywood that the film didn't succeed! India's best thriller has gone unnoticed! The only other Indian thriller that I'll put on the same shelf is Teen Deewarein. But there's still hope for this one and hopefully people will watch this movie otherwise they really don't know what they're missing.\n",

I decided later that it must be relatives of someone on the film as the one review is exactly what is on the DVD box. The movie was quite good however. It was very confusing at first as it did not explain what was going on until a good 4th of the way through the movie. I almost gave up on it, but then was glad I didn't. It is about a cop who becomes a criminal to destroy crime. My disk was very poor quality but there were enough explosions to satisfy any action type person. The romance was a little thin but the dancing to Ganash was awesome. The movie is about revenge and also forgiveness.\n",

One scene where Inspector Satyaprakash (Ashutosh Rana) is showing incense stick (Agarbatti) in his police station, like a typical common man, to the map of his area, the handcuff, arms and by mistake to the wanted list pictures, then tries to correct his mistake is nice one. One dialogue by him \"SARKARI SAMPATTI TABHI TAK TUMHARI HAI JAB TAK TUM ISKA ISTEMAL NAHI KARTE \" is also very good. I was expecting such type of scenes and dialogues from this political satire movie but became disappointed. Performance wise Ashutosh Rana is impressive. Rajpal Yadav is fair. Director Mr. Rajpal Yadav fails badly to execute an interesting plot. Unnecessary use of camera panning (Turning left right) in scenes irritates a lot. Camera work is bad especially while pans. It is blur and jerky. Directing a play and movie, is different thing. If one wants to adopt a play then he should must watch \"WAQT\" Starring Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopda and \"Oh My God\" starring Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal. These two movies are the classic examples of play adaption. Music and lyric are good and according to mood of film. It paces up the movie. Climax is so boring and clumsy that you start praying for end of the movie. Production value is more than it was required. Huge crowd, huge sets, avoidable expensive equipments are not meant for an experimental cinema. After all, it is a boring movie.\n",

Isha Koppikar was such a good actress and here too she tries to deliver a smooth piece of seductive hot image with a vicious personality as a killer. But apparently she fails to even come close to the performance delivered by Sharon Stone. Like say the interrogation room scene from both the movies. Manoj Bajpai although disappoints the most as we never expected such a lame movie from his banner. The entire movie is almost predictable. Some plots, here and there are not the same as the English movie. Songs are mostly bullshit. Its painful to see good actors, like the leads in this movie, to land up in once or a while shitty roles like these. It may click some movie halls in the sub-urban crowd for the so called steamy scenes which too were very hardly seen.

            "This movie is based on a novel of the same name by Bakim Chandra Chaterjee. This novel was penned a century after the events actually happened. Notwithstanding its literary significance, the novel has overtones of Hindu revivalism and attitude of co-existence with the British rule which is a major departure from the actual incidents of this movement. There are official records documented by British officers of at least three incidents where the Muslims and Hindus together fought against the East India Company. The actually rebellion, on which this movie is based, was a united Hindu-Muslim revolt against the British known as the Fakir Sanyasi Rebellion which engulfed most districts of northern and eastern undivided Bengal during the early part of the British colonial rule in India (1767-1800). This rebellion was led by a Muslim Fakir, Majnu Shah and a Hindu Sanyasi, Bhawani Pathak, a fact that is totally ignored in this movie.\n",

            "Jawani Diwani was a landmark comedy primarily because of RD Burman's fast, pounding and melodious score. RD Burman was such a genius; his musical legacy will live on forever. When his music combined with the voices of either Kishore or Asha (or both), the result was electrifying. A case in point is this movie.Kishore gives the start with the energetic and beautifully sung \"Samne Kaun Aya\". He later also executes the title song \"Yeh Jawani\" in his unique comic style (Kishore was said to have the unique ability to put himself right in the shoes of the actor for whom he was doing the singing). However, it is the combination of Kishore with Asha on \"Aa Jane Ja\" that creates one of the most memorable songs of Indian cinema. The picturization of the song is perfect, there is a sense of mystery in both the setting, the voice and the music. This one song will keep on ringing in your ears long after hearing it and, to my knowledge, is being remixed now over and over again by so many.In so far the plot is concerned, this is the simple story of boy (Randhir Kapoor) meets girl (Jaya Badhuri) at school, with the usual problems with parents. However, the acting is great. A special note goes to the great Satyen Kappu who gives, in my opinion, his most comical performance ever (as the DJ friend of Randhir Kapoor) in two scene-stealing pieces: first, when he impersonates Randhir Kapoor's father to meet the boy's teacher, and later when he meets Jaya's father.In short, you have here everything that a great Indian movie is made of: a good story, very good acting and excellent music.\n",

Although full of great stars, this film does tend to get a little typical in places, but you won't notice that as you'll be too busy enjoying yourself! The story is basically about two brothers (Dharmendra and Rishi Kapoor) being separated at birth. Thier father is killed by the notorious bandit Black Cobra (Amjad Khan). Dharmendra loses his memory, Rishi Kapoor is raised by a pickpocket theif, and the mother spends her time searching for them. The film sees great laughs and plots throughout (especially with Dharmendra and Zeenat Aman), the younger son is first reunited with his mother, then comes Dharmendra, and the only reason for this is that they are all after one thing - a golden deity saped like a chariot. Both the sons are unaware they are actually in their real mother's home. Dharmendra wants to steal it for Zeenat Aman, whilst Rishi wants to steal it for wealth. Through a considerable amount of laughter you'd want to press rewind on your vcr set and see it all again!\n",

            "Released originally in Kannada in 2015 -- and you just have to see how original this concoction of gaudy construction is -- Luv U Alia now comes in a Hindi version to prove what film lovers already know. Bad commercial films in any language are equally bad.There are no redeeming qualities in this banal, cheerless, sloppy, clumsy and distinctly dumb rom-com about a shifty marriage counsellor Kiran (Chandan Kumar) who gets the hots for a girl named Alia (Sangeetha Chauhan) only to realise that her father Ravi (V Ravichandran) whom Kiran suspects of being a slimeball with a stethoscope, is actually an angel in a doctor's coat.Whoever thought this spindly rom-com would actually work needs to be honoured for optimism.The second half of the abominably sickening, over-sweetened and corny confection has Kiran winning over his future father-in-law by pretending to be a nurse, a female nurse, let me hasten to clarify. Ha ha. What follows is clunky comments on broken marriages conducted by a director who has serious problems escaping the multi-coloured toys of his childhood that seem to have chased his filmmaking aspirations into adulthood.The film looks like a cross between a 8-year old child's drawing-book image of a lavish lifestyle and a 20-something year old's most outlandish porn fantasy.One of the film's highpoints is the hero in drag pretending to seduce his girlfriend's father. If this strikes you as distastefully incestuous, then be warned. Good taste is not a strong quality in this colourful romp.The sets and locations are as garish as Lego buildings constructed by a child who favours red green and purples.If Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge fell on its head and suffered serious injuries, this film could be the end-result. The performances are beyond atrocious. Everyone has the licence to act goofily without fear of repercussions.In the second-half, the long-missing Bhumika Chawla who once tolerated Salman Khan's weird hairstyle in Tere Naam, shows up to tolerate the hero's weird.everything!

            "As a US resident, I had never heard of this film (the title means \"Strange Night\") before I saw the very high user rating it had on IMDb - mainly, I suppose, from Asian viewers. I found the DVD on Netflix and ordered it with an open mind. I was very impressed by it. In this review I want to tell other US residents without a background in Indian cinema studies why they might want to watch it and what to expect. (By the way, please don't believe the blurb which focuses on a man thinking a woman looks like his wife. This happens, but it's by no means the focus of the film.)This film is not exactly in the realistic style. In its general structure, it is maybe more like a Puccini opera or a work from the classical Greek theatre. My reference to Puccini is not meant to emphasize the musical elements of the film. (There are basically five songs, some of which are sung by the characters with joy and pride while, in counterpoint, we watch fate and malice prepare different outcomes.) Mainly I mean that the dialogue is more central, and the meanings of the sentences more important, than in the modern realistic western film tradition which judges the film on how well the actors reproduce the actions of real people in the situation. The characters speak to get their positions out there, rather than (mainly) to shove the narrative arc of the story down some tricky path. But there is an arc.At the beginning of the film, the \"cold open\" as we now call it, we are introduced to Baldev, a warm-hearted guy, working as a watchman in charge of some bungalows, willing to fetch everyone's purchases from the market, even though the bags get mixed up and his friend teases him as a fool for letting himself be used by everyone. Baldev loves Gopa from afar, too bashful to speak to her... it is a warm-hearted, rom-comish scene. At length he proposes and sings of his happiness.Then the opening titles come - and then we are somewhere else, much later, with a grimmer tone. Baldev is nowhere to be seen. Honestly, I thought for a while that through some convention of Indian cinema the first part was an independent short subject, or maybe an ad for some other movie. But that wasn't correct. Baldev turns up later, in changed circumstances.We are at a \"rest house\", or palatial hostel, occupied by the disabled owner; his devoted servant, Ramdas; and his granddaughter, Rama, played by the same actress as Gopa in the earlier segment. The building and its family treasures are to be sold at auction to satisfy the debts owed to cruel and wealthy Mr. Madan. But he announces that he will forgive the debt if Rama will marry him. The grandfather won't have it, but Rama is unwilling to have him turned out... The exploitation of women by cruel men, and of the poor by the rich, are themes of the rest of the movie. We also told of choices which the poor must make - whether to sacrifice their lives to preserve or rescue others, whether to take revenge, and how to live.An elderly rich man, Mr. Rai, and his young wife, Prema, arrive for the now-canceled auction. The weather is threatening, and they are invited to stay over. A vagabond artist also seeks shelter from the storm. Later others arrive. We hear more of their lives, and the consequences of the choices they have made, or haven't had. Ultimately a last set of choices gets made.When the movie was over, I felt lucky and clever at the same time. Lucky, in that the opportunity now exists to see movies made fifty years ago on the other side of the world. Clever, in that I had the good sense to reason that very high ratings on IMDb mean something and might provide the opportunity to enjoy something that I would never have thought of on my own. I would watch this again. The songs are really beautiful, especially against the remembered backdrop of the portions of the movie in which they were sung.\n",

            "Although Raj Khosla was known as the master of suspense in Indian Cinema (e.g. \"Kala Pani\",\"Who Kaun Thi\", \"Mera Saaya\") he also had an occasional try in romantic movies. And when he did, the result was usually another masterpiece, as is this movie.Briefly, the story revolves around Manoj Kumar's meeting, love, then sacrifice for the heroine played by Asha Parekh. Nothing extraordinary, you would think. But this is an extraordinary movie, indeed. Manoj Kumar, Asha Parekh and Pran's acting are superb and the compositions of music director Ravi are nothing short of breathtaking.On the musical side, Rafi really outshines everybody here with his melodious finale song \"Naseeb Mein\". His first two songs in this movie, namely \"Bhari Duniya\" and \"Raha Gardishon\", are certainly gems. But there is something in \"Naseeb Mein\" that does it for me. This is an immortal, unparalleled and sublime love song by Rafi at his peak. Lata is also excellent in \"Lo Aa Gaaee\", but its Rafi's unique voice that keeps resounding in your head long after watching the movie.In a nutshell, \"Do Badan\" is a real gem of the 60's. Do not miss it, especially given the fact that nowadays movies aren't made like that anymore...\n",

            "Known as Guru Dutt's final offering as a producer, Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi is generally a nice and enjoyable picture. The story, taking place in the editorial department of a leading newspaper, starts well but loses its freshness and becomes a bit typical towards the end, and maybe it just seems dated today. Mala Sinha plays Amita, the managing director of her late father's company who wishes to entail his legacy of printing a reliable paper based on truth and fairness. The entire concept involving the daily life of people at the offices of the newspaper press, and the values people work with is actually very well presented. It is the triangular love story that follows which is a bit tiresome and kind of uninspiring to me, and sadly at some point it takes over the far more interesting proceedings involving the newspaper, which are more socially relevant. In this regard, a great start which provides a wonderful commentary succumbs to commercial constraints.In its favour it can be said that the film benefits from an almost uniformly well-written script and fantastic dialogue. The songs are very good but they are not very suitable and some of them come in overly close proximities in the movie, dragging the narrative. The acting is very good. Mala Sinha, of the most skilled actresses of those times, successfully creates a tough screen persona of a strong and decisive woman with a soft inside. Dharmendra plays the young, idealistic and stubborn young man yet again, and he does it well. Tanuja is bubbly and effective in a role that I think the film would have been better without. Towards the end the film grows increasingly intense and melodramatic and I did not like the tragic ending. But the bottom line is that Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi is a highly watchable movie from Hindi cinema's golden era and it's a worthy effort, particularly for those who enjoy watching Guru Dutt's cinema.\n",

Mithunda being younger and physically in way better shape than these guys seeing that his movies were not doing so well in major cities but very successful in smaller territories and theatres even in the cities; and if they could be made cheaper could be very profitable for all involved moved to Ooty in Bangalore.He Purchased a chain of hotels there,moved there with his family and worked with mostly the same cast and crews to make cheap but not necessarily bad action-thriller movies.Shapath is the best of them!Trust me I've seen all of them.The main plot deals with the mystery regarding the killing of local politicians by the cities gangsters to keep their bought and paid for politician in power.It's very intricately plotted since we don't know till the very end who's the boss(course it's kind of guessable)but the fun is in watching Dada and Jackie solve the puzzle together and kick some serious ass along the way.The action sequences are very,very well done.Specially the climax where it's just one long sequence running for around 25 minutes and it's some serious carnage including cars blasting,limbs tearing,3-4 guys jumping in the air after getting kicked and bursting through glass walls.Kudos to action director Rambo.One of the best things about the movie is it's solid supporting cast with nobody hamming or phoning it in.Kader Khan,Gulshan Grover,Salim Ghouse,Ranjeet(my favourite)and Raza Murad are the bad guys; what a line-up.Achyut podtar in a rare positive role was surprising.And Shakti Kapoor & Guddi Maruti were wonderful as the comic relief's.

            "Sangdil is a pretty loose adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, especially in the first half. Once it gets to the second half, it is much more faithful to the novel, and even includes elements that many other adaptations have left out. The Jane and Rochester characters (called Kamla and Shankar) are childhood sweethearts separated by Shankar's mother, who acts as Aunt Reed. Kamla/Jane is still an orphan, taken in by her father's friends, who are Rochester's/Shankar's parents, and they have stolen Kamla's properties and lands (although for some reason this fact is never addressed, even when Kamla and Shankar get together). Kamla refers to them as aunt and uncle, the uncle treats her kindly and regrets stealing her lands, but the aunt treats her cruelly. When the uncle dies, the aunt decides to send Kamla to the orphanage, to separate her and Shankar. On the way to the orphanage, accompanied by the Mr Brocklehurst character, Kamla throws herself out the carriage (about the only rebellious and spunky thing she does as a child), and is found by ascetics who take her to a temple devoted to the worship of the Hindu god Shankar; where she grows up to become a priestess in the temple. Meanwhile, Shankar, the man, is forced by his mother to marry the Bertha character. After several years apart, Kamla and her temple go to Shankar's lands to perform in a harvest ceremony--Shankar is supposed to be away, but ends up coming home at the last minute with a group of friends, including the Blanche Ingram character (I don't remember what she's called in the film). Shankar doesn't recognize Kamla at first, but she knows him. From the time they meet, it does follow the Jane Eyre story more closely--there's Shankar getting thrown from his horse on his first meeting Kamla again, the fire in Shankar's bedroom, the wedding aborted by Bertha's brother, the gypsy scene (only in this version, Shankar poses as an ascetic astrologer) etc. When the wedding goes south, Kamla flees back to the temple and tries to forget him, so there's no St John character. After Kamla and Shankar meet again, Kamla is struggling with her feelings for him, because as a priestess, she should give up worldly ties, especially with the opposite sex. So it's not just his marriage to Bertha (although she of course doesn't know about Bertha) or their different stations that keep them apart, but her religion plays a large part as well. What I did think was interesting, is that Shankar still accuses Kamla of cruelty and hardness because her faith does not allow her to shack up with him despite his wife--and at the end when they finally do get together, Kamla repeatedly asks forgiveness for \"deserting him\" because of that faith. This is one of the few adaptations of Bronte's novel which has kept in the religious/spirituality aspect of Jane's character, and showed how important her faith and those values were to her; which also explains why she chooses to leave Rochester. Without that aspect of her character, I don't think her reasoning is fully explained, and so I was glad to finally see a version which kept that in. Sangdil was an interesting movie, although there were some things I didn't like. There wasn't a great deal of chemistry between the lead actors, and both Kamla and Shankar were very monotone. The actress playing Kamla/Jane as a child was pathetic, she simply didn't react most of the time to anything, whether it was the aunt being cruel, or her supposedly happy; she simply had little reaction, and she certainly wasn't angry or rebellious as Jane was supposed to be as a child. But the actress playing Kamla/Jane as an adult was pretty good, and as I've said, I liked that they addressed the spirituality part of Jane's nature more than any other version. It's also one of the first and few versions to have the gypsy scene. The actress playing Bertha falls into the same trap as almost every other actress playing her, and goes excessively over the top, and her madness seems to consist mostly of hysterical laughter, which sounded rather like a cross between a hyena and a baboon. The DVD I saw suffers a bit from poor quality, and the picture and sound weren't the best. If you're a completist like me who has to see every version of Jane Eyre you can, this version is definitely worth tracking down.\n",

            "A magnificent movie despite some unrealistic sequences. This has all the ingredients of a good movie but what I liked the most is that it has some social values; i.e. a doctor's prime duty should be to serve humanity & destitute but just not earning money. Manoj Kumar is excellent as doctor. Mala Sinha as Phoolwa is amazing on occasions but most of the times she is loud & over. David and Kanhaiyalal have done well. Others have supported brilliantly. No surprise it was adjudged the Best Movie at Filmfare Awards in 1966 and it also got five other nominations; Best Actress – Mala Sinha, Best Supporting Actress - Shashikala, Best Singer - Lata Mangeshkar, Best Lyricist - Indivar and Best Music - Kalyanji Anandji who have delivered beautiful songs such as; 1) Unche Himalay Ke Neeche 2) Kankariya Maar Ke Jagaya, 3) Ik Tu Jo Mila Sari Duniya, 4) O Tu Raat Khadi Thi Chhat, 5) Ek Tu Na Mila Sari Duniya, 6) Chand Si Mehbooba Ho Meri and 7) Main To Ek Khwab Hun Is. A must watch for all Hindi movie buffs.\n",

            "Masterji is a comedy film starring Rajesh Khanna in the title role and Sridevi's comic timing was explored for the first time in Hindi Cinema in this film. Sridevi had done many films in Tamil before this but she never got to star in a movie where she could display her comic side.This laugh riot is fully based on confrontations and difference in point of view of the lead characters in various matters.This film was released during school reopening time of that year and end of vacations.So many people flocked to theaters to see this family entertainer and resulted the film being a big hit of the year.Khanna had 11 releases in 1985 and 8 were hits. Khanna proved his versatility by attempting this film. 1985 saw Khanna prove again that as an actor he could do films of different genres with ease. Bhagyaraj starred in title role in Tamil opposite Urvasi and had written and directed the same in Tamil. After its success in Tamil, he wanted the Superstar himself to essay this role in Hindi and so wrote the screenplay but asked Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao to direct the Hindi version.\n",

            "Nasir Hussain is known for making family films with long lost brothers, lost families due to circumstances created by the villain and his henchmen. They are known for the illogical action sequences but have a good story. Nasir Hussian is a veteran director known for his super hit films like Yadoon Ki Baarat but Mr.Hussina, your power won't last through the 80's, 90's if you make such melodramatic action films which will work latest in the 70's. This was Hussian's and Deol's second film together after Manzil Manzil which flopped. Sadly, this movie is also declared a flop. The story is nothing new, it is a typical Hussian movie where problems arise because of the bad people, but Deol takes revenge and clears his dad's name from murder. Pretty typical and this is getting old now. Honestly, Manzil Manzil was a flop but I liked it, this movie was a bit of a letdown, yet the suspenses effect is good. Still, Nasir Hussian's journey ends here and he will be no longer making any films.\n",

Zeenat Aman is also a chorni who flirts with both Kishen and Kanhaiyya for her own hidden agenda.Bombay 405 Miles is a complete masala entertainer which was director Brij Sadanah's fortè. From Victoria No 203 (1972) to Chori Mera Kaam (1975), all his successful films were about hidden wealth and bunch of thieves out to get it. Logic be damned, they were all fun to watch and Bombay 405.. was no different.Zeenat Aman looked absolutely gorgeous and her flirtatious moments with Vinod and Shatru are the films highlight. Pran Saahab had an interesting role of a blackmailer who just dials any random number from telephone directory and warns the receiver of the call that he knows their \"raaz\". Haha! Amjad Khan was super duper as the main villain characterised by his playing with toy marbles.Overall, Bombay 405 Miles is an entertaining movie though it didnt do well commercially.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "Political satires are frequently produced in Bollywood, and most of them (Miss Tanakpur Hazir Ho (2015) being an example) are worth a good watch. But, this one here is an amateur concoction which lacks good writing.Tukaram (Shreya Talpade) and his wife Sunanda (Manjari Fadnis) are a farmer couple from the state of Maharashtra who have come to Uttar Pradesh with the intention of taking back the land which is rightfully theirs. The land which they claim to have inherited from their forefathers is where the Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, now sits. This revelation puts the whole country in a tizzy as politicians and policemen shift in their seats and scramble to get to the root of Tukaram's alleged claim. The story then employs a comical style as the duo knock the doors of the high court.The story is less of a satire and more of a political farce created just to vent the ire regarding the difficulties faced by farmers due to crony commercialization of land. The primary subject of the film being exploration of corruption in land deals around India, the film takes a dig at politicians - both sitting and opposing - who are known to exercise nepotism to help industrialists grab lands from poor farmers who are then left with the only option of suicide. However, the silly premise which the film bases its whole mountainous topic on is hardly entertaining. It reeks of unimaginative writing, with no care given to research.With a contemptible twist towards the end, the film faintly brushes on the history of Indian monuments and preaches about the demerits of industrialization which is often cited as a cause for development in India. Talpade is pitiful in this drama as he tries to look appealing in his avatar as a Maratha-faithful farmer. Fadnis should take acting lessons and improve her ability to control her expressions, which are not always helping. Supporting cast is fine, but they are not directed well.Lastly, the title of the film is straightaway misleading. If people are thinking that it talks only about a farmer claiming to own Taj Mahal, then they will only be satisfied for about 5 minutes. Rest is pure contrived nonsense. Overall, this could be a light-hearted watch for a family only because of the theme it explores, but make sure you leave your logical thinking capability at home.BOTTOM LINE: Ajit Sinha's \"Wah Taj\" is a film that is something totally different than what its title hints at. It is an amateur film about land sharks and the curse of industrialization. Watch it on TV if it airs.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n",

            "This movie is actually not as bas as some people make it out to be. You should not forget in which time this movie was made, the 80s. Okay so the cast is huge (Jeetu-Sri/ dharm-poonam/ anil kimmi and the villains and comedians) but it is not as huge as THE BURNING TRAIN (Dharmendra, hema, Jeetendra, Neeut Singh, Vinod Khanna, Parveen Babi, Navin Nischal, Simmi Garewal, Vinod Mehra, Padmini Kapila, Danny Denzongpa, Ranjeet, Sujeet Kumar and many more) which was a much better film. Jeetendra and Sridevi were THE stars of the film. Actually the film had started during Anil's TEZAAB days but released actually after MR India and Anil was not pleased that Sridevi was not opposite him in the movie and did not want to complete the movie. A few extra scenes were wrtiiten especially for him featuring La Devi (now His Bhabhi). These were the days when Anil had some point to prove : either trying (unsuccesfully of course) to replace Amitabh bachchan (who the hell can ever replace GOD???), He had a beef with Sanjay Dutt and Sunny Deol as well. And after Awaargi en Deewaane Mastane where Govinda upstages him 100 percent even Govindsa was on his blacklist. Anyhow, the movie is worth a watch, its what we call CAMP\n",

Well, there IS indeed some kind of mystery here, like: \"Where did it (the mystery) go?\" It's just your usual, ordinary (for a thriller) story, with a few (wanna-be) twists; though, I must say, it wasn't really THAT badly done. (Which is why I rated it 5 out of 10) (Well, at least they tried, gotta give them that...) But, if you have watched a few Indian (aka 'Bollywood') movies of this kind, you know how the story goes and what to expect. Compared to some others it's actually not so terrible, but, just the same, it's not really great either.One of the good things about it is that there's few songs. (At least from what I remember...^^) But it's nothing worth wasting your time with. Unless you're a Dino Morea-fan and like to see him without his shirt. ^^ Concerning the actors and actresses, I think they tried to do/did the best with what they got (as a script - ... - they DO get one, don't they??!). And at that, they did okay. Though none of them impressed me. Who knows what this movie might have been with a better script... But, then again, it might have lost it's 'Bollywood movie'-charm.

            "Danny Dengzopa's directorial debut featuring the superstar Rajesh Khanna and Kim (whom he later married). This film is one of the best Hindi horror films. Apparently it has no haunted faces and fictitious haunted stuff but it provides an edge-of-the-seat entertainment to its viewers. The protagonist has been haunted by her aunt who killed her mother and was sent to mental asylum. Rajesh Khanna is a psychologist who treats her and eventually falls in love with her. I will not speak a word after this about its story. It is a must see for people whose favorite genre in movies is horror. It has an enthralling suspense and will make you more and more engrossed as the story will progress.Commenting on the technical points of the movie, it has no flaws. The director, cinematographer and art director has done complete justice to their work. Music by R.D. Burman is enchanting. Lata Mangeshkar's haunting melodies have made the songs memorable. Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyrics were fine.I would rate it as 9.8/10 because it has the ability to entertain young as well as middle-aged viewers in terms of horror story.\n",

            "'Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche' was a sort of new experiment in the domain of Horror. The flick created vibes when it was released in 1972. I grew up hearing stories about this movie and most of the people who watched it, recommended it. The film was sensational and involves a simple plot which unfolds itself to be one of the best plots. The characters are more than believable and have performed to their best limits. Surendra Kumar as Rajvansh has continuously excelled in his performance throughout the film. Shobna as Anjali has performed to her diabolic best. Imtiaz Khan as Anand has a considerable part in the movie, which he has done justice to. Finally, we have Satyen Kappu playing cunning 'Mama ji', who is a wolf in lamb's skin.The story begins with Rajvansh, who has come to a graveyard to pay homage to his deceased wife. On the way he finds a girl in trouble. The girl is being chased and manhandled by some roughnecks. Rajvansh saves the girl and it turns out that her name is Anjali. Rajvansh takes Anjali to his house, so as to make her feel comfortable. At night Anjali and Rajvansh are unable to hold their emotions and make love. In the morning, Rajvansh promises Anjali that he will marry her. Anjali has only one relative i.e. Mama ji, who is cunning as a fox, shrewd as a jackal and greedy as a monkey. After few scenes, Rajvansh and Anjali get married and begin spending their good times at Rajvansh's grand bungalow. Rajvansh is a very wealthy man. He has a big estate and was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Besides, he also spends his time looking for herbs and plants in forest and keeps experimenting in his lab. We can make out that his experiment involves raising the dead.Time goes by and Rajvansh begins to realize that Anjali and Mama ji are exploiting his wealth. Mama ji is a man of vices. He visits brothels, is a drunkard and spends most of his time gambling with crooks. He frequently needs money to fulfill his alcohol urges and wants to milk Rajvansh for this. Anjali on the other hand keeps fulfilling Mama ji's demands. Rajvansh is frustrated and keeps himself away from Anjali. One day, Rajvansh saves a beautiful girl, who turns out to be a teacher at a local school. Meena (Pooja) is a beautiful and sober girl, who respects Rajvansh for his good behavior and ethics. Meena realizes that Anjali and Rajvansh share a sour relationship. A few days later, Rajvansh is shown experimenting in his laboratory, when a fuming chemical spills on the table and somehow mixes with drinking water in the jug. Rajvansh accidentally drinks some water and is paralyzed. During this time Rajvansh realizes the selfishness of his wife and selflessness of Meena. Meena looks after Rajvansh while Anjali sits idling away her time and avoids contact with Rajvansh. Mama ji realizes that Rajvansh is now no more than a crippled horse and should hence be murdered. Anjali discusses this plan with her ex-boyfriend Anand, who agrees to take part in the scheme for the sake of love. Anand poses himself as a doctor and pretends as if he is a versatile medic and promises Rajvansh of fast recovery. One night Anand injects a highly potent poison into Rajvansh's body. Rajvansh dies after some struggle and Anand, Anjali and Mama ji bury the corpse '2 feet under the ground' (hence the name 'Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche'). Finally they come home only to realize that the keys to the safe are still in Rajvansh's pocket. Anand and Anjali rush to Rajvansh's grave and dig out the corpse for keys. However, the keys are not there. The keys are later found in Mama ji's pocket, but he doesn't how he got them there. Enraged, Anand beats up Mama ji, and drives him out of the house. The next day Mama ji sends some vagabonds to take care of Anand. After a good fight, Anand is able to subdue the goons, and they run away.It is at this point the horror begins. Anjali begins to see Rajvansh's corpse walking out at night. She hears his voice. She soon finds out that Rajvansh has become a zombie and is still alive. She gets the idea that Rajvansh won't stop, unless he has taken revenge from those who killed him. A few days later, Mama ji dies after falling off a high cliff. It seems he was scared to death after seeing the zombie, and tumbled down as he lost his balance. Anand doesn't believe on Anjali, when she tells him about the zombie. However, he soon witnesses the presence of a ghoulish entity at close range. Something is lurking in the dark, looking for the victims.So what is so special about this movie? As we can see the plot is very simple, but what makes this movie worth watching is the creepy atmosphere it holds within. The movie has a hypnotic quality, that forces the viewer to get engaged with the story way too deeply. The shooting locations are spooky, the graveyard is eerie, the zombie is gruesome, even the darkness spread across Rajvansh's bungalow is sepulchral and most of the horror inducing sequences are truly shocking. The motive of a horror movie is to give shocks with entertainment. Since the plot is simple here, one is easily able to concentrate on the storyline, and as there are several scenes that make you jump off your seat, the movie is fairly crawly as well. One should watch this movie, and believe me, this is a serious stuff and a must watch flick for the horror buffs.\n",

They plot together to ruin Sameer's and Asha's love to get them for themselves with crazy and ridiculous plots that wouldn't work in real life if one had a million dollars. So they ruin the two lives of people just to get with them even though Asha does not love Raj and Sameer does not love Simran.

            "The movie starts out with Hanuman having received his tuition of the Sun God and Hanuman asking the Sun God for a return-favour so as to pay him back for the tuition he received. The Sun God being estranged with his own son, Shani (Saturn), asks Hanuman to bring him out of the continuous anger and into 'the light'. This is followed by some traditional knocking down of doors etc which leads to a fight and finally with the son coming to his senses due to Hanuman 'knocking' some sense into him. After this, Hanuman is sent back to earth so as to visit his mother, Anjani and he's duty-bound by his mother to go help Sugriv (the monkey-king) whose wive has been stolen by his bigger brother Bali (with a little help from Raven). On his way to find help defeating Bali, he's instilled with the love of Ram like he was in his youth (when he was a animal-friend of Ram) by the whole of the Devic folks living in the Himalayas's with Shiva and Parvati. The wonderful song: Bhajle Ram inspires Hanuman to seek out Ram again and soon he encounters them in. After deceiving them first in his guise as a rishi he gages their insight in the dharmic laws and afterwards prostrates himself to the endless glory of Ram. The story takes a faster pace from this moment on, where the role of Bajrangbali is reduced to that of Ram's messenger and fiercest fighter and Ram takes the main-spotlights away from Bajrangbali. It's only at the specific parts after the Lanka-kand, that Bajrangbali, gets his own 'mischievous' nature back and performs his 'lila'. Things missed in this 180 minute marvel are the stories about the patal-encounters which are recounted in yet another movie (title: Hanuman Vijay) where his relations with Makri, Makar-Dhwaj and all the others are given more depth. All in all a wonderful tribute to Hanuman and a wonderful starter for anyone interested in Hindu mythology and specifically the 'lila' of Hanuman.\n",

            "V.K. Prakash's Phir Kabhi is a dramatic feature which tells the love story of senior citizens, Hari Singh and his teen sweetheart Ganga. A recently-widowed Hari receives a letter from Ganga in which she invites him to take part in a school reunion party with all their past fellows. This sequence, although a tad clichéd, is very nicely done and is filled with nostalgic-laden memories presented through several flashbacks into their past lives as students. There also begins a renewed relationship between Hari and Ganga. Hari is surprised to know that Ganga has never been married, and the two start exchanging letters and even meeting from time to time.Phir Kabhi's concept is rather interesting and is well presented. The script is for the most part good, and the narrative is extremely subtle. Director V.K. Prakash effectively directs the film and gives it an engaging feel, although the film has its loopholes, sadly. One example is the fact that Hari's daughter in-law disapproves of this relationship and he quietly accepts it like one of those disciplined mamma's boys. I mean, come on, why would any middle-aged man do what his daughter in-law demanded from him, and who is she to give him any orders in the first place? That was quite pathetic and unconvincing and almost ruined the entire film for me.Where the movie easily makes up for any of its flaws is in the performances. Mithun Chakraborty is excellent as Hari and he looks incredibly authentic in a role that gives him full scope to showcase his great acting skills. It's almost impossible to believe it is actually the one who played the Disco Dancer Jimmy and the action hero of so many flicks. Note the scene right after the death of his wife, when he cannot find his glasses and mistakenly calls his wife. Just see his deep devastation when he suddenly recollects that she is actually no more. Dimple Kapadia is also well cast to support Chakraborty and she delivers a restrained performance. Gulshan Grover is very good in his role, and the rest of the cast lend adequate support.Phir Kabhi is an interesting film and in spite of its flaws, does leave a mark. The performances, particularly that of Chakraborty, easily make it a watchable feature.\n",

It is light classic entertainment for some leisure time.The movie was released when Rajesh Khanna ruled Bollywood as the Super Star. Had it been released a couple of years ago before Rajesh Khanna became a sensation, the movie would have done more business on the circuit, still..... it did good on the box office.The song \"Mujhe teri Mohabbat ka Sahara ......\" is beautifully filmed in the lush green and picturesque Kashmir valley. Mohan Kumar did great piece of direction to make the song and movie a success. Needless to mention, if Saddhana had been paired with Rajesh Khanna, the movie must have been a block buster. It is strange that Saadhana being a renowned and charismatic actress, only appeared once in \"Dil Daulat aur Duniya\" with the Super Star of that era.\n",

            "After watching such movies as Boot Polish and Jagte Raho, produced by the great Raj Kapoor, I could not miss Ab Dilli Dur Nahin. The premise was very interesting, and the film is quite good, but not as good as expected. The film imparts the journey of Ratan, a little kid who goes on foot to Delhi (Dilli) to save his father from death. His mother died of a snake bite and soon afterwards his father was charged with murder and convicted to death penalty for no fault of his own. After the father is sent to Delhi to await his death sentence, the kid meets a petty thief who confirms that at the time of the murder he saw his father sleeping near his wife's grave. That's when his journey to meet the Indian prime minister of the time, Jawaharlal Nehru and prove his father's innocence begins. And he has many obstacles to overcome.Generally a watchable movie telling the story of hope and struggle, Ab Dilli Dur Nahin was a rather experimental film at the time, and the one who fearlessly invested his money in this project was none other than the great Raj Kapoor. This is actually one of the least famous films he produced. The film's title itself, which is more of a slogan, made me go and watch it. Though it is definitely worth the watch, it's not flawless. I liked the beginning a lot, and I found the portrayal of the family and the couple very convincing and moving. This portion of the film shows how people, despite financial difficulties and hardships, were happy with what they had. Unfortunately the death of the female heroine happens too soon and it's a sad view, and the following proceedings only add to the tragedy.The film's songs are lovely, but they are so many that at times they just drag the narrative. The director does try to portray the story realistically, but at times the film gets a bit melodramatic and the main conflicts as well as the villains make it look more of a fairy tale. As far as acting is concerned, the film's main protagonist is the kid Master Romi, and he does reasonably well but never well enough. The supporting child actors do much better, for what it's worth. Motilal does very well in his role, while Soluchana Latkar is excellent in her brief appearance. Anwar Hussain makes for an ordinary villain. The film's ending is very sugarcoated and is easy to predict. I thought the movie would have worked better as a children's movie, but it was far too serious. Ab Dilli Dur Nahin may not be a great film, but it has a good concept and it is an altogether appreciable effort.\n",

            "Govinda and Karisma are very charming in this romantic tale. With their charts against them, the young lovers (Govinda and Karisma) are not permitted to marry. But they will not accept this fate. They run off into the night, finding themselves at the den of an evil sage who is trying to coerce the handsome Lord of the Snakes (Nitish Bharadwaj, more recently known for his mega-series roles as Krishna in Mahabharata and Vishnu in VishnuPuran)into giving him a gem he needs to make the nectar which will give him immortality. The rub: it can only happen on this one night of the full moon -- which comes only once ever 25 years -- and the arrival of the young lovers and their defense of the Lord of the Snakes (NagRaj -resplendent in a black sequined body suit when in human form) has angered the sage, who then turns Karisma to stone for 25 years and causes the demise of Govinda. NagRaj saves the day by proclaiming that Govinda will be reborn, still with love in his heart for Karisma, and 25 years hence they will find each other again -- and only in his presence will she be able to speak and move (but not mention his former existence). Will the lovers ever be together? Will Karisma become a real woman again? Will the evil sage get his due? Don't miss this great tale!\n",

            "This movie has a simple story line.Ram Chand (Amitabh Bachchan) is elder brother of Ravi Chand (Anil Dhawan). Ram is moderately educated where Ravi is highly educated. They work in the same office where Ram is Peon and Ravi is Boss.This is one of the early movies of Amitabh Bachchan and he is sensible and sensitive in underplaying this demanding role. Tanuja plays role of a lively girl with ease. Looks like its in genes - her daughter Kajol has delighted us in many such roles she played. Even Anil Dhawan (does any one remember him?) has played his role with dignity.Apart from this you can't say much for or against it. The simple story line also means that the much of glitter and glamour is missing (except for again what Tanuja provides). That explains why the movie was not a commercial success, but again it is not bad experience to watch it.\n",

This is a lost and found formula movie with some good songs by Naushad for a change in a Rajesh Khanna movie and no Kishore Kumar songs in the movie. The movie at times is melodramatic with loud dialouges and loud acting but is tolerable because both the actors Raaj Kumar and Rajesh Khanna have their style of acting. Jeetendra is washed away between them. Amjad Khan also has a big double role and looks huge and terrifying. Waheeda Rehman is there too. An entertainer which was an average success may be due to the fact that the theme was very common by then.

Nonetheless, it is an interesting watch and delivers good laughs.Jr. NTR:: Performance wise, strictly OK considering the fact that \"original\" NTRs blood runs in his veins. And yes, his dancing skills deserve special mention - very supple & fluid.Mohan Babu:: Initially, you search for Satyanarayana in the character but as you go along the tide you feel his performance is equally impressive, if not better.Priyamani:: Manages to effective evoke the sympathy of the audience with her \"miss-goody-two-shoes\" performance and her soft expressions. You are glued to her until Mamta Mohandas appears on the screen.Mamta Mohandas:: Now she is one heavy-weight if I might use the expression for every time she appears in the frame she sets it ablaze. Bessotted - completely!Khusboo:: No meat in the character.Naresh:: Good to see after a long hiatus and well suited for the role of Narada.Rest of the star cast is adequate.The art department and the CGI deserves nothing short of standing ovation. And same should be said for the concept of resurrecting the \"orignal NTR\".

            "Raaste Kaa Pathar review :One of Amitabh Bachchan pre-Zanjeer flops; Raaste Kaa Pathar had an interesting and oh-so-bold concept for the '70s. Amitabh played an executive in a modelling agency who lets his boss hire out his flat for their private affairs in order to further his career. One day, his super boss (Prem Chopra) asks for the keys to his house. Only Bachchan doesn't know that Chopra intends to take his lady love (Neeta Khayani) there..There was a parallel track of Amitabh's jobless writer friend played by Shatrughan Sinha whose wife (Laxmi Chhaya) is forced to sell herself for a living in order to run the house.Of the cast, Amitabh Bachchan had the central role and he nailed it. The sexy Laxmi Chhaya outshone the lead Neeta Khayani even in a smaller role. Shatrughan didn't suit the loser character he played. Prem Chopra was his usual. Satyen Kappu's wig was hideous to say the least..At concept level, Raaste Kaa Pathar was too bold for the '70s which was the prime reason the film fared miserably at the box office. However, the same plot wowed the millennium audience when director Anurag Basu borrowed it for Life In A Metro (2007). A classic example of oft repeated filmi adage that what doesnt work today may work tomorrow!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.\n",

            "Story: The overall theme is nothing new, but could have been written into a good story. However as it turns out the story is completely idiotic and many details are painfully illogical.Dances: Physical Training (PT) scenes are portrayed in an amusing manner. For a few minutes you can enjoy them as 'what are they doing?' In any classical sense bad.Songs: A couple of songs were above average.Acting: Overall below average. Jetendra was fine, but Leena Chandavarkar was not so good. I have seen some good acting from her in other movies. Here, she looks as if she just cannot act. Just as an example, in at least one scene she glances directly into camera while delivering a dialog. An actor cannot do that, unless they are addressing the audience.Action sequence: Fight scenes were pathetic. Would have been fine for a kid's movie.Comedy: Excruciatingly painful and misplaced intermittently throughout the film. Apparently the producer/directors must have been taught that comedy scenes are (were in 60s) compulsory in any good Hindi flick. So they forcefully added comedy scenes that had no relevance to the main story. Mehmood, for instance, was an outstanding comedian in his time. Unfortunately, he was used in extremely ludicrous ways in many Hindi films and 'Humjoli' is no exception. Just like the fight scenes, the comedy is suitable for kids under age of 8.Overall Rating: 5. This includes 2 points purely for the nostalgic value you get from watching a 1970s movie. So, if you are a younger generation, you might consider this film as a '3' or lower. Even though I rated it so low, I did not think I made a mistake in watching it. I still wish to continue watching more 1950-1979 movies - again, for the nostalgic attribute.\n",

            "Deepshika has come a long way since she made her debut. It's been a long struggle for an actress who previously had no connection to the film industry and with 'Yeh Dooriyan' she proves how far she's come. Here she assumes multiple roles behind the camera as director, producer, writer, costume designer and plays the lead actress. She also chooses an interesting theme that is considered controversial in India, that of a successful independent divorcée with two children being in a relationship with and wanting to marry a younger man. Deepshika's treatment of the theme is sincere and well addressed well. It is especially stressed out brilliantly in the final sequence. Clearly this woman has put a lot of effort into the film.However, 'Yeh Dooriyan' has plenty of faults. I can understand that Deepshika wanted the film to appeal to the masses but the writing tends to adhere to clichés. Most of the dialogue is substandard. The pacing is also uneven. The songs are below average (a few are quite dreadful) and they appear randomly, visualized like MTV videos. Keshav Arora is another weak link. His acting, especially when he confronts Simi after his mother's departure, is very poor. The rest of the cast are space-fillers.The one to keep her head up high is the gorgeous Deepshika as the leading lady. Finally she has created a role for herself that exposes her talent as an actress to the fullest and she does a remarkable job. She is the main reason to watch 'Yeh Dooriyan'. If only her script was tighter and she didn't follow Bollywood conventions, the film could have been something solid. But hey, now that she's demonstrated what an effortless performer she is, better luck next time. I'll be looking forward to her next ventures.\n",

            "India has stepped in to the animated world which is ruled by Japanese anime and American Disney or Pixar. And they have made quite a splendid effort. The story might not go down well with every one but it's important to know that the story is not scripted. The movie is based on Ramayana, at least what follows after Lord Ram comes back to his kingdom. Lord Ram symbolizes the ideal king, ideal husband and so on. Sita is the ideal wife, mother and so on. What this story tells us is about their ideal children, Luv and Kush. The story in itself is so beautiful that the movie had to be splendid. Animation might not be as powerful or realistic as the Americans do,but it's beautiful. It has a very sweet message in the end about brotherhood. It will help if you get to know the story of Ramayana before hand so that you realize what is actually going on and what has led to this story. It's a fantastic effort. Highly recommended.\n",

He had became really chubby and desperately needed to lose weight. God knows what made him think that he could survive in the film industry looking fat as ever and that too as the hero of a movie. Rishi was utterly unbelievable as an undercover cop. The only reason I watched that crap was for Sridevi. She was great as a psychiatrist wrongfully accused of a murder. But what's more ridiculous is the fact that she herself believes that she committed the murder while in fact she was innocent. She did her best to rise above a stupid script though. The first half was great as it was filled with suspense. But the second half was sluggishly long and once the identity of the killer is revealed, you wanna laugh!!! the movie throws a lot of red herrings at you, but at the end you feel they were not worth it!!!The songs are quite hummable. 'Hakka Inna Yelo\" and \"La lai la lai\" deserve special mention. Overall, give KSKJ a miss!!!\n",

            "If \"Sadiyaan\"'s only attraction was new faces Luv Sinha and Ferena Wazeir, it wouldn't lure many film-goers into the cinema. But, a triumvirate of talents make it a worthwhile enterprise: Hema Malini, Rekha, and Rishi Kapoor. Fortunately, enough screen time is given to these veterans, who persuade one to overlook the newcomers' tepid performances.The film begins in tumultuous times: it is 1947, and Amritsar is the roiling scene of sectarian violence. As India is rent asunder into two countries, corpse-laden trains ply between Amritsar and Lahore, as Hindus and Muslims slaughter each other in horrific numbers. Sikh Rajveer Singh and his wife Amrit (Rishi Kapoor and Rekha) flee their Lahore home in what overnight has become Muslim Pakistan and take refuge in the abandoned Amritsar haveli of a Muslim family that has, likewise, taken flight from Hindu India. They discover a toddler in the debris of the mansion, and try to look for his family. When they realize all the Muslims in the area have died or gone across the border, they raise the child with all love and tenderness. Their own son had been killed, and they rejoice at this second chance at parenthood.The first time Rekha appears on screen, her eyes are shut, and her luxuriant false eyelashes make one think twin moths have alighted on that gorgeous face. My heart sank, because over the years, Rekha has taken to gilding the lily. She possesses an enviable amount of talent, but her screen makeup and wardrobe have become more and more rococo. One wishes she would simply wipe off the excess makeup, dispense with unnecessary baubles, and let the sheer incandescence of her talent and her substantial natural beauty shine through. God knows she has enough of both. But that was just a momentary stumble, for once the story and the actress get going, there isn't a chance to notice things like false eyelashes and the overly fussy tendrils framing those legendary features.Rekha's Amrit is a paragon of maternal love. But her mother act refrains from becoming cloying. When her adoptive son falls in love with a Muslim girl, and her family refuses to accept a non-Muslim son-in-law, Amrit decides to come clean. Placing her son's happiness above her maternal instincts, she reveals that not only is he NOT her son, the boy is Muslim, as well. When the prospective in-laws accuse her of concocting a story for their acquiescence, her husband and she set about looking for any living relatives of their son in Pakistan.For years, both sides had thought it impossible for anyone to have survived the bloodbath of the Partition, but miraculously, Amrit and Rajveer's search turns up the boy's parents (Hema Malini and Javed Sheikh), patricians who number among Lahore's elite. The girl's family cannot believe their luck, and immediately agree to the match. When the birth parents show up for the wedding and announce that they will take their son and his bride with them to Pakistan, Amrit and Rajveer are tested anew. Director Raj Kanwar recognizes his young leads couldn't possibly shoulder the film, and gives the stalwarts plenty of time and screen space to take the story forward, and they don't disappoint.The film belongs to Rekha, with Rishi Kapoor gallantly abetting his two leading ladies. Hema Malini gets less screen time, but dazzles as the elegant, aristocratic Benazir who is reunited with the son she'd feared dead. Shatrughan Sinha, new actor Luv Sinha's father, was never known for his looks. Against popular wisdom, he sought a career in film, graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India. At a time when Hindi film heroes were fair and handsome, his dark unconventional looks and chutzpah set him apart. His dialogue delivery and flamboyance made him the go-to villain, and later on, a surprisingly successful leading man. While I wish Luv Sinha the best in his chosen profession, I would be remiss not to point out that he lacks the looks or—and more's the pity—the talent to make one take notice of him. His Ishaan is callow in the extreme, and his puny physique and unimpressive dialogue delivery don't help. Had he been paired with a beautiful, capable actress, his shortcomings would have been glaringly obvious. Luckily his co-star, like him, is neither good-looking nor talented. Rekha is a wonder to behold, and I wish her screen outings were more frequent. When there is a good story and a good role, she goes at both with a gusto that is awesome to watch. She looks terrific, too, and over the years of 1947 to 1961 doesn't age by even a single day. I loved her simple but artsy wardrobe, and her great grace and dignity in the face of a tremendous sacrifice. Rishi Kapoor has gone from cherubic leading man to excellent character actor. In fact this transition has let the actor inside emerge. His turns in \"Luck By Chance\" and \"Fanaa\" were a treat to watch. Here, despite not having as showy a role as Rekha, he effectively conveys the anxiety and pain of a parent who might lose his only child. He chivalrously allows some grey to peek through in his beard over the time span of the film, while screen wife Rekha remains impervious to the passage of the years. Hema Malini at sixty-two is possibly more beautiful now than she ever was as the Dreamgirl of Hindi cinema. Her Benazir is dignified yet passionate, and oh-so-elegant in her Pakistani shalwaar-kameez and pearls. They truly don't make them like Hema Malini and Rekha anymore: one leaves the cinema with that thought and the fervent wish these ladies get the opportunity to show their mettle in more films. Come on, filmmakers, that's not too much to ask for, is it?\n",

The story becomes interesting as Manisha's popularity begins to sink and she loses the status of being India's pop culture icon. It is interesting to see how her whole world simultaneously comes crashing down. Her lack of ability to draw enormous crowds along with her break-up with Aryan tears her apart. It is nice to see how Manisha gathers up courage to protect Preeti, her new professional and romantic rival, from being used like she was by Aryan. However, the awful ending completely ruins the film! What was an admirable struggle for justice and self-respect ended in a disheartening act that shows hopelessness and weakness.

            "New releases directed by respected veterans of Hindi film industry always put me in a serious dilemma of choosing the right words. Since at one end I got to see their latest projects (despite a limited release) expecting something extra-ordinary justifying their cult image but on the other, have to review them impartially too pointing towards their major shortcomings without getting influenced by the nostalgic factor associated with their reputed names.However the situation becomes worse when you get to see a downright trashy film from the man behind much appreciated projects such as JAANE BHI DO YAARON, KABHI HAAN KABHI NA, KYA KEHNA and the life teaching serial NUKKAD, forcibly making you think about skipping the review to avoid the severe harsh assessment deserved by the awful project. Honestly I wasn't expecting Kundan Shah's latest film P SE PM TAK to be that bad and this eventually puts me in the same tough situation as previously experienced while reviewing the last films of Dev Anand and Subhash Ghai.Interestingly when it comes to the old-timer experts of our Hindi film industry still working in the present scenario, we are unable to find personalities like Clint Eastwood who amazingly manages to deliver great films even in his eighth decade of life celebrating the spirit of cinema. May be it's our different working patterns, questionable system or other social (personal) factors that might be the cause behind such repeated failures. Yet the truth remains that here we have seldom seen a director playing a long consistent innings till the last phase of his life churning out cinematic gems.Returning to Kundan Shan and his P SE PM TAK, where P stands for 'prostitute' as per the film's impractical storyline, it can easily be rated as one of the most tacky and annoying black satires that fails to grab your attention right from its first scene. Revolving around a bold girl's journey from a brothel to the major political stage becoming the Chief Minister (the post of PM is only used as a reference in the end), the film refuses to talk logic and remains mediocre in execution with all uninteresting sequences coming one after another with many terribly written dialogues muted more than 15 times by the censors with a beep. A badly conceived film based on a weird subject, its neither a comedy nor any satire with the most irritating factor remaining its background score that keeps screaming loudly in almost every scene unnecessarily.Having a quite poor script progression and a distasteful style of narration, the film features an otherwise beautiful girl Meenakshi Dixit in the lead, trying hard to deliver a noteworthy performance in vain, looking unconvincing throughout in the given role. Plus its really painful to see the entire known supporting cast acting as amateurs including Bharat Jadhav, Aanjjan Srivastav, Deepak Shirke, Mushtaq Khan, Yashpal Sharma and the lesser known face Indrajeet Soni. Interestingly the ugly get-up of the minister also reminded me of a similar one tried by Kamal Hassan in his film MAYOR SAAB.The below average songs inserted at regular intervals just for the sake of it keep irritating you constantly and then the post interval inclusion of an absurd idea of a corpse made active again (speaking, walking and even dancing) through a remote control and some electronic gadgets fitted in the body by an eccentric scientist, makes you look at the screen with an unbelievably shocking amazement and jaws dropped. Perhaps director Kundan Shah is still somewhere stuck in the fascination of using a corpse as an entertaining prop in the storyline since JAANE BHI DO YAARON released three decades back. But here the particular senseless sequences with all forced humour turn out be a big disappointing let-down from the experienced director unarguably.Summing up, frankly this is not what we expected from the 'once creative genius' Kundan Shah. And it's actually quite disturbing to admit that a film like P SE PM TAK will now get included in the filmography of the same person who will also be remembered as the vision behind JAANE BHI DO YAARON, one of the first five cult black comedies of our Hindi Cinema. Unfortunately a fact that is sure going to confuse many students in the future studying the hugely contradicting body of work of the well-known director.\n",

Joy Mukherjee looked handsome and done full justice to his role Asha Parekh was expert in such roles and did her role very well. Rajender Nath The Comedy King was great in the role of \"Dimfu\" he was simply great in the picnic scene and also when he speak wrong English. All the songs are great Title song, \"Lakhon Hain Nigah Mein\" and \"Aankhon Se Jo Utri Hai Dil Mein\" are the best among the lot.The beautiful locations of Kashmir are a treat to watch. There is a scene in the movie when Joy tells Asha that there is nobody to wait for him so why would he come and then Asha asks him \" Agar Koi Intzar Karne Wala Hota to Kaya Aap Aate?\" I mean that is called Love. That was the beautiful feeling of love where words were enough to express and no need of body moments. These days where love means lust you will never find such beautiful feeling again.

But, even before this Dutt gave some of his worst films like Jeena Marna Tera Sang(1992) which flopped, though Aatish which came later in 1993 was a hit, Dutt was criticized for his typical role. And, between 1991-1993, he gave a few blockbusters and before 1991, in year 1990, Khatarnak was released. The film is nothing new, which Dutt film have we not seen with drugs involved, when hasn't there been any gun fights, when hasn't there been any boring songs though the stars one stand out. The film is an age old gangster action film and the drug scenes are copied from Scarface. Though, the film is still a hit, not a super hit. It manages to entertain, it gives one of Dutt's finiest typical gangster performances. There are no patches and the film is well edited, though it slows down when Farha gets widowed and Dutt's change from a gangster to a good man is slow paced. But, the re entry back to the crime world and the last 30-40 mins of extraordinary action is well shown. Bharat Rangachary impresses with his fine direction and the acting is top noch. But, if Dutt does even more good movies like this, he might not make it through even this decade. Dutt is no gangster, his gangster image is typical and he mostly uses his guns and has no expression. He needs to actually start acting and not shooting yet his role as Suraj is awesome, his ice cold killer role is good but he needs to find different roles, he's too typical. The film is pretty good and I recommend it. Though, again the reason it didn't get a 8 or a 9 out of 10 is because it is a typical movie where Dutt changes from being bad to being good!\n",

He fantasizes about Kamana aka Kammo aka Gulabo (Shradha Das) but ends up marrying the girl-next-door Lakshmi (Kulraj Randhawa).Even after marriage, he still fantasizes about Kammo. Rather the whole Luckypur is behind Kammo, but what was so special about Kammo I could not figure out. Lucky has excuses of 'Hath Tang hai' always for not meeting Lakshmi's needs. Another character is Sunny Paji (Ravi Kissen), brother of Kammo and Dabangg of Luckypur with whom Billo (Madhavi Sharma) is madly in love. Then an accident leads Lucky to believe that his wife is dead. Instead of mourning her death, he falls into Kammo's arms. Turns out, he is not that lucky.The film is a total mess from start to end. The writers tried to add a lot of vulgar dialogues in between as it's the latest trend since Grand Masti's success. The film takes off to a different level in stupidity after the accident plot wist. Another annoying factor of the movie was that the supporting cast was too weak and the character development was very poor. There is a character named Sexy Baba in the film played by Sanjay Mishra who is a complete disaster and will annoy you with his screen presence. There is nothing much to talk about the acting performance of the lead actor Eijaz Khan or the other casts. The movie is a complete failure even for those who enjoy vulgar jokes and trashy dialogues.The film was touted to be a romantic-comedy but but there was neither comedy nor romance.\n",

            "Somebody said that Indian cinema is getting 'bold' with every passing day. Well that's not the correct word. Indian cinema is getting 'sleazy' with every alternate film and very soon 'soft porn' will be a new genre in film directories. Fun is just an addition to this list. Sex, skin and smooches (or to put it more starkly sleaze, flab and tongue-twisters) are stored in galore for the viewer in Fun. Fun boasts to be the first Indian film to be based on the theme of husband swapping and we pray this should be the last film as well. The director does take his theme seriously and makes sure that each lady in the film swaps her husband. Natasha (Payal Rohatgi), an outgoing upper society girl is married to a criminal lawyer, Aryan (Siddharth Koirala). She not only proposes and plans husband swapping for her two friends but also stealthily devices the same game with her husband and another woman Megha (Hina Rehman), plus herself indulges into adultery. All this happens in the first half where the director makes all efforts to highlight every possible sordid detail in the film. And like all skin flicks, this one too shifts towards the who-dun-it path in the second half when suddenly Megha is murdered. However the change of track from erotica to thriller doesn't affect the skin exposure quotient of the film. Apart from what the film shows; what's more appalling is how it shows. At no point, the happenings on the scene can be tagged as sensual. Its outright cheesy and downright gross! No matter to whatever extent the actresses expose, A 'Payal Rohatgi' can never be a Bipasha Basu A 'Hina Rehman' can never be a Lara Dutta But yes Fun can (surely) be dangerous (to mental health). The cinematographer of the film is completely focused on his target and never does he miss any opportunity of capturing the cleavages and belly buttons of the female form on screen. The background score composer, in an attempt to generate sensual overtones to punctuate the skin fest on screen, ends up creating 'ooh' and 'aah' sounds that appear more as if endorsements of 'Iodex' and 'Hajmola'. If the director even had a tinge of aesthetic touch in the execution of his scenes and if he could balance the sex and suspense elements (he completely goes overboard with the former) in his film, he could have gained a slight leniency in his movie rating (though it still wouldn't have been more than an additional half star). Only two words for Siddharth Koirala -'Quit Bollywood'! Aryan Vaid is lackluster. Payal Rohatgi appears bland even in her mugged up dialogue recitation. The other unmentionables of the cast are involved only in unmentionable activities of the film. No pun but Fun has no fun. Neither is Fun, funny. In fact Fun makes fun of itself.\n",

            "A film, slickly directed by Chetan Anand and produced by Dev Anand's Navketan. A very good entertainer with very good music by Sachin Dev Burman. After having given music for a classic like \"Devdas\" in 1955, Burman da proved his versatality as he came up trumps with his musical score in this light hearted entertainer in 1956. Kishore Kumar's \"Ai meri topi palat ke aa\" and \" Dene wala jab bhi deta, poora chhapad phaad ke deta\" are lovely light numbers. So are the two duets by Kishore and Asha Bhosle, \"Aji aaj koi na hamen chhediyo\" and \"Woh dekhen to unki inayat, na dekhen to rona kya\"! Kishore's \"Dukhi man mere, sun mera kehna\" remains one of his best numbers ever. Dev Anand gave a good performance, while Sheila Ramani was a perfect foil to him.\n",

The movie has good music by Laxmikant Pyarelal and some numbers were very popular then and still are. Rajesh Khanna is good in the movie and is in various characters all rolled into one. He looks great in action scenes also. Zeenat Aman looks good and performs well. This is a revenge drama told in a different style but as suggested if one is not careful - he would not understand. It is of course a must watch for Rajesh Khanna fans as he shows his skills in all - action, comedy, romance and drama.\n",

            "Aaj Ki Awaz review :Inspired from the Hollywood film Death Wish (1974), Aaj Ki Awaz had Raj Babbar and Smita Patil in lead roles with Nana Patekar debuting as the main villain. In a rare instance, Alok Nath known for his sanskari roles, played a rapist goon here.Raj Babbar turns vigilante after his sister is brutally gang raped by goons who work for Nana Patekar. Smita Patil plays a lawyer who tries to get him justice.The film ran in to Censor trouble and the gory gang rape scene (filmed on Roshni) had to be re-edited before release. Still, it was quite explicit for that time and evoked considerable criticism. Raj Babbar's performance was deservedly appreciated and Nana Patekar left a mighty impression even in a small role. It was the beginning of his long and successful innings in Hindi cinema.I think this was first proper Bollywood adaptation of Deathwish and after its success, Hindi remakes ki line lag gayi...Andhaa Kaanoon (1983), Awaaz (1984), Paapi Pet Ka Sawaal Hai (1984), Paththar (1985), Balidaan (1985), Mera Jawab (1985), Bhavani Junction (1985), Jaan Ki Baazi (1985), Indrajeet (1991) and so many more.

The main lead (sumit Nijhawan) should first learn acting before trying into movies. He has no expression and his dialogue delivery is very poor. The actress (Mona Wasu) looks old and should try doing grandmother roles instead of lead actress.

            "Sunil Shetty was not a good actor till he got films like Anth, Gopi Kishen, Dilwale even flops like Takkar improved his acting but continued his flop streak. In his first films like Balwaan, he stood out like a sore thumb and only did the action with great energy, though the film was a hit, it didn't give him much. In my opinion, this actor does have many flops in his career, but it is in these flops, he builds his character, he builds his acting skills. He works hard and even if he doesn't succeed, he is one step closer to success always. Through his half a dozen flops, he has improved as an actor, he has shown his true skills, he has not provided absurd performances as he did in parts of his journey. He is one actor who succeeds even after failing.Vishwasghaat is one such movie where Shetty gets to show his skills again but fails to succeed at the box office. Though the movie was a flop, he displayed his true core skills from raw breath taking action to brilliant drama. This movie is more of a thriller at the start but slowly slowly, it becomes a typical Sunil Shetty action fare like his 5 other flops from 1995 which just did nothing but drop Shetty's career. Though Shetty rebuilt himself in 1996 with the violent action hit Rakshak, he kept getting flops like Shastra and Ek Tha Raja. In 1997, Shetty revived his career with blockbuster war film Border and hit Bhai. Though nonsense action films like Judge Mujrim and Prithvi brought him down. Dhaal was a bad film though the concept of delivering a message was a good idea. Coming back to Vishwaaaghaat, this is truly forgotten film. Though the film has one good twist with Anumpam Kher being a dynamic character, it doesn't have much to offer. Sunil Shetty is wasted in a role he has played a million times. Yes he does his part, he does what is needed, but he fails to show the emotions, the sorrow, the pain in him when he says I can't tolerate injustice. But as an action hero, he excels. Though he fails in the emotional and romantic department, he gives a better performance than his earlier craps movies like Raghuveer, Gadaaar and the flop film with Akshay Kumar Hum Hain Bemisaal. From each of his flops, he improves as an actor and this is his proof of improvement. Anjali Jathar is as beautiful as they come, but her being angry and making a scene in public is childish and a pain in the head. This is not the way you get a guy to be interested in you when he is worried about thugs after you and himself STUPID GIRL. Anumpum Kher excels as the true villain and the impostor of posing as a good father. The other villains like Kiran Kumar are garbage and provide weak support. They do nothing but shout and then get killed by Shetty. The story of this film is good to a limit, the typical action fare is the same thing but still fun to watch. The romance angle seems forced on how can a man fall in love with a girl in such a short time. But, the movie is from 1996 so this is forgiven. On the whole, Vishwaasghaat is a wooden as they come. But i give it a 4/10 for the awesome action and twist and some good songs and performances and dialogs. The Final Verdict: Sunil Shetty is a good actor though wasted in this film, sign if improvement is always there.\n",

With talents like Mahima and Rekha you would expect at least something decent. The camera seems to focus more on Mahima's boobs. Why did Butala make her look so cheap? Her outfits were downright trashy (inconsistent with her character). The dialogues are so awful (many of which are stolen from American sitcoms), the plot has no focus and characters are poorly written. There wasn't much Rekha and Mahima could do except refuse the film (which they should have). They didn't seem interested in their respective roles. Kim Sharma needs to take acting lessons and Vasundhara Das hams beyond belied. Ashmit Patel should be banned from cinema. Except for the title songs, the rest leave your mind immediately. But even though the title song has some nice beats it is utterly forgettable like the movie (which in fact is best forgotten). Avoid at all costs. Or watch it to learn how to not make a bad film.\n",

Chandrakant (Old Jeetendra) marries a rich girl (played by Moushami Chatterjee) but they have no house to live and jeetu has no job either. However he gets some job and soon establishes a huge business. Later he gets no time for his wife and son Ravikant (Young Jeetendra)and eventually Moushami dies of illness. This is Pyaasa Sawana all about. They had money, riches, son, love but still could not spend splendid moments with each other. Then a leap of 20 years Ravikant marries Reena Roy after falling in love with her and history repeats itself. Watch out what happens with this couple??? Will they have the same destiny as his parents had?I would rate this movie as 9.6/10. It is a must see if you believe in love, affection, spending moments of love together and destiny. Soundtrack by Laxmikant Pyarelal is superb. Each song has some entertainment to give. Be it \"MEGHA RE MEGHA\" an excellent melodious number by Lata and Suresh Wadkar, \"O MERE CHAMAK CHHALO\" a romantic funny number by Asha and Kishore and \"TERE SAATH HAI JO MUJHE KYA KAMI HAI ANDHERON MEIN BHI MIL RAHI ROSHNI HAI\" a Lata's solo number which conveys emotions of married life is also worth listening.

The atmosphere of an upper-class Muslim home is captured very well, and the performances of Mala Sinha and Nirupa as young mothers of different faiths are good. While Shashi Kapoor as the illegitimate Muslim son adopted into the Hindu family is okay, it's also fascinating to see Rajindra Kumar in a minor role as and even more fanatic Hindu. There's little suspense in the story (the only question really is if Shashi will live or die after he finds out he was born a Muslim) but the first half and the message of communal harmony are handled quite well. It's certainly a Yash Chopra film --social issues disguised in a romance, and still effective today.\n",

When Anil demands that she stay at home and look after the kid she files for divorce. A few years later Anil remarries, this time with a young and principled Radhika who is all willing to be a mother to his six-year-old son. That's when Kamini appears in their life. Her approach has changed and she understands her mistake upon meeting her little son.This is the basic story of J. Om Prakash's Apnapan, a colourful melodrama involving relationships and social norms of those times. The film is not completely convincing and the script has its share of overdone emotions, but it does manage to move you on several occasions. Apnapan is shot quite beautifully, some of the locations are eye-pleasing, and the music is very melodious. Lovers of Hindi cinema and its unrestrained nature would certainly enjoy watching this movie, but otherwise the movie is a tad too melodramatic at points. That said, some scenes are well handled and the dialogues are generally well written. The movie stars Jeetendra as Anil. He is quite okay but is not particularly impressive. Sulakshana Pandit is beautiful and lovely as Radhika. Reena Roy is a bit too aggressive in the first portions of the film while playing the noisy wife, but she gets far better in the film's second half, although the transformation itself is not very well done. As a woman who realises her mistake and turns into a tormented mother longing for her son, Roy is credible and exudes warmth. Apnapan could have been better, but as a Hindi movie of its sort, it is quite enjoyable and at times moving.\n",

This film will mainly relate to the youth, who are just starting off their college life and also those still in the last few years of school. It's a very feel good movie with lots of humour and amazing music. Big fan of the title track by Remo and Chalo chalte hai Mexico sung by Shaan. Today even high budget movies are quite bad and the music is quite average. This movie seems much refreshing and better in comparison. Even the locations are beautiful. The climax you may not enjoy so much, I thought it was terrible. I didn't like that angle, the theme of the movie takes a full deep turn.

            "Dharmendra and Jeetendra play childhood friends, but that gets tested when Garam Dharam learns that jumping Jack ( Jeetendra) is a criminal - or is he? Watch this fairly entertaining potboiler that has the usual dooshum, dooshum (fights), romance and songs, but what really stood out was Amjad Khan's performance. He's a villain but a funny one. The main villain is Kader Khan, who also wrote the dialogue. Asrani is hilarious as Khan's assistant who repeats everything he says.\n",

            "In this documentary, film-maker Damon Gameau becomes his own guinea pig and spends 60 days eating healthy foods with added sugar. Before this process, he had eradicated sugar from his diet so the contrast is even more pronounced. Over the course of the 60 days he puts on considerable weight, experiences mood swings and notices a drop in overall motivation.What I found so alarming about this film was that it didn't play things easy and simply expose the dangers of excessive sugar intake. Gameau doesn't consume any junk food whatsoever, such as fizzy juice, sweets or ice cream, he instead purely sticks to food marketed as healthy. It's this more than anything that sets off alarm bells because this route seems to most people a route to weight loss and improved physical well-being, yet as the film demonstrates it actually leads to obesity and mental damage. Time and again we are shown the volumes of sugar that is hidden in so-called 'healthy' foods and it makes you pause for thought. What comes out loud and clear is that sugar is clearly a socially acceptable form of addiction and the sugar industry have been instrumental in minimising public information on the dangers their product presents. It's very interesting to note that over the course of his 60 day experiment Gameau eats no more calories than he did previously, yet he puts on almost a stone in weight. One of the key lessons, therefore, is that there are calories and there are calories, i.e. sugar calories affect the body decidedly differently to the way protein and carb ones do.The approach taken by the film is very much of the fun and informative variety. Sometimes the humour doesn't work so well but in the main this approach is good in that it is very accessible. After all, this is a film that you would want children to watch and learn from. There are a couple of star cameos with Hugh Jackman giving us a brief history lesson about man's relationship with sugar and Stephen Fry pops up to explain some of the science behind it. On the whole, I found this to be an excellent wake-up call about a subject I had hitherto given minimal thought to. There is a lot of very valuable information in this film that could be genuinely life changing if applied to your day to day life, and I reckon that is as good a recommendation as anyone could need.\n",

            "American novelist Brian Garfield wrote a popular novel'Death Wish' in 1972 which was adapted for a Hollywood movie of the same title and also for a TV series. The theme of this story contains the activities of somebody who has lost a lot in the hands of the criminals and thus developed a death wish in his heart. He wants to die but instead of dying in the normal way, he wants to die in his bid to eliminate as many criminals as he can. This story has inspired many novels and movies in India. Aakhiri Adaalat(1988) also seems to have been inspired by Death Wish only because it shows a group of public-spirited people who are aggrieved in their personal lives because of the criminals roaming about the society. Fostering death wish in their hearts, such people now fearlessly go after the criminals and eliminate them, terming it as the justice of their court(Adaalat).Aakhiri Adaalat(the final court) starts with a gang of hardcore criminals who have taken the city to ransom by their law-breaking activities. This gang consists of Girija Shankar(Paresh Rawal), Shiv Saran(Gulshan Grover), Bansidhar(Sarat Saxena), Mahaveer Shah(Girdhar), Raghunathan(Roopesh Kumar) etc. alongwith their henchmen. Honest and dutiful cop Inspector Amar(Vinod Khanna) is after them but his style of functioning is not liked by his seniors like the Deputy Superintendent of Police(Shafi Inaamdaar) and the Commissioner of Police(Sudhir Dalvi). The DSP himself is sold out in the hands of these criminals and helps them in different ways. Amar lives with his widow mother(Sushama Seth). Nitin Sinha(Jackie Shroff) is Amar's fast friend who lives with his widow mother Mrs. Sinha(Seema Dev). Nitin loves Nisha(Sonam) who is the daughter of Barrister Shankar Sharma(Vinod Mehra) who apparently does not like the affair of his daughter with Nitin. Amar and Barrister Sharma are also not on good terms because the criminals caught by Amar with a lot of effort are acquitted by the court due to the efforts of Barrister Sharma who pleads for them. To keep a vigil on Amar as well as to restrain his enthusiasm, the DSP gives him an assistant in the form of Sub-Inspector Reema(Dimple). However within a span of time, Amar and Reema fall in love.Suddenly a killing spree starts in the city against the criminals. The killer wears a specific leather jacket and a specific helmet covering his whole face and he arrives on a motorbike to take on the outlaws. Many criminals including some of the high profile gangsters mentioned above are killed by the biker. Since the identity of the killer is not known, it is also not clear whether it is the same person every time or just the get-up is the same used by different people on different occasions. Amar alongwith Reema is after this mysterious murderer but all his efforts go in vain. And the tragedy is that Amar himself comes under the suspicion of being this mysterious helmet-wearing biker who kills the criminals. First Reema suspects him because a similar leather jacket and a similar helmet is found in a closet of his bedroom, then after knowing the fact from Reema, Amar's mother also accuses him to be this mysterious killer. A disheartened and demoralized Amar who now feels as completely lonely in the world, leaves his own house. He gets suspended also by his department.To wash the stain of being the killer himself from his name, Amar investigates the things in his personal capacity and gradually some new and startling facts come to the fore. Amar comes to know now that the killer is not a single individual but there is a full-fledged organization populated by public-spirited people who hate crime and criminals. Different members of this group wear the publicized get-up of the killer, use the bikes and eliminate the criminals because they are disenchanted with the reigning judicial system which appears more to be in favour of the criminals than the law-abiding citizens. The reason behind this disenchantment and their rebellious attitude towards the society and the law is that they had not got justice from the same when they were aggrieved.They call their organization their own court in which they themselves play the roles of judge, jury and executioner together for the criminals who deserve the strictest punishment as per their philosophy of justice. They have lost their desire to live and it's the death wish in their hearts that has made them daredevil.On the other side, now only one gangster - Girija Shankar is left among his group because all others have been killed by the jacket and helmet wearing biker. He decides to use the myth of the helmet-wearing biker-killer now well-set in the public-psyche to his advantage. He starts killing the innocents while wearing that get-up and riding a bike, thus maligning the image of that mysterious-killer in public. Now the members of this unusual society have to prove that they do not kill innocents and some oversmart criminal is killing the innocents while hiding his true identity behind the get-up known to be belonging to them. They seek Amar's help in this regard though Amar considers it his duty to arrest them and handover to the law. In the end, the villain, i.e., Girija Shankar is caught by Amar with the help of the corrupt DSP(who has had a change of heart). However what the court established by the system and the law of the land decides for this self-designated court, remains a question which the filmmaker does not answer.The corrupt and ineffective judicial system of India in which the proceedings move at a snail's pace with no hope for justice for the victims, does not recognize such parallel courts or clandestine societies running a crusade against crime. But they may be welcome by the aggrieved and victimized underdog if they do emerge in India also the way they had emerged in many other countries long long back.\n",

            "Andha Yuddh (1987) narrates the tale of two such used ones only out of whom one is an outlaw and the other one is a cop. Both realize quite late that the war being blindly carried out by them is actually not theirs and they are not aware of the real motives of the masterminds behind as well. Andha Yudhh (blind war) starts with the murder of the chief minister of the state. The killer – Raaja (Raj Babbar) is running away from the police when he gets shelter in a home holding the only person available there at that time as captive who is a handicapped girl – Saroj (Pallavi Joshi). Dutiful cop – Suhaas Daandekar (Nana Patekar) is chasing him and now seeing that he has held the handicapped girl as captive in his bid to escape from there, he works out different plans to catch him. He seeks the help of a doctor (K.K. Raina) and a nurse - Maadhuri Paande (Divya Rana) in this regard. The nurse enters the household under the pretext of administering the essential medicine to the handicapped girl and tries to give a sedative to Raaja but fails. All the family members of Saroj alongwith the cops, i.e, Suhaas and his subordinates plus the press reporters are witnessing the high tension drama involving two sides with different motives – a cat and mouse game, putting it straight. On the other hand, an emotional interaction goes on between Saroj and Raaja inside the house. Saroj who herself is highly depressed because of her crippled condition and a bleak future, asks many questions from Raaja taking him down his memory lane containing several painful incidents that took place in his childhood and youth. She puts up certain ethical questions before him and they share a lot, despite Saroj still fearing Raaja and Raaja still not relying upon her sympathies towards him. Raaja has been led to commit this murder through a brainwashing of him, making him believe that he would be serving a noble cause by doing it. Gradually Raaja realizes that he has been misguided and used to carry out that evil deed by someone who has been benefited from that. Saroj asks him to surrender to the law but Raaja has some different intentions. He seeks clear path from the cops to escape from there with Saroj by threatening to kill her. Before that he gets her clad in a red sari. Suhaas follows them and kills Raaja upon getting the first opportunity to nail him. Before that Raaja has conveyed to Saroj the name of the person who got the CM murdered through him and Saroj conveys the same to Suhaas. Now Suhaas also realizes that himself was in a blind war with Raaja and his position is no better than that of Raaja. In fact, both have been pawns in the hands of the real chess player, making moves from both the sides. This realization of Suhaas paves the way for the finale of this movie.Andha Yuddh is a very impressive movie with no songs or regular Bollywood formulae like romance, comedy or fight. It is an out and out realistic intense drama which keeps the viewer hooked. The viewer seldom realizes that the regular entertainment factors are absent in this movie because already there is so much to keep him tied to his chair. The plight of Raaja and his exploitation moves the viewer deep within.Through the character of Raaja, the filmmaker has emphatically underscored this fact that man is nothing but the product of his experiences. One can give back to the society only what he has got from it in the first place. When the society itself turns an innocent into a criminal, what can he repay to it ? Producer Neeta Sharma herself has written the story of this movie which is damn good and brought on the screen by the director Dayaal Nihalani with a high degree of proficiency. The movie is engrossing right from the word go to the very finish and provides enough food for thought that can be utilized by the thinking viewers to make a better society.The final act of Suhaas appears to have been created to please the front-benchers and not in line with the mood of the movie. I fail to understand when the filmmaker did not give a damn for the tried and tested formulae for creating the major part of the movie, then why the hell did he go for an utterly Bollywoodish finale ? If he wanted to make a formula-studded commercial movie, then he could have made the whole movie in that style only.The highlight of this movie is the performances. Nana Patekar as the no-nonsense dutiful cop on one hand and Raj Babbar as the misguided outlaw on the other, have delivered towering performances. I especially admire Raj Babbar who showed his mettle in the difficult role of the hero who appears as the villain. Then we have Pallavi Joshi whose talent never got justice from Bollywood. She has done superbly in the meaty role of the handicapped girl whom we can consider the heroine of the movie also. Divya Rana as the nurse has also done exceedingly well.The director has done the rightest thing by keeping the movie free from songs. The background score prepared by Ajit Varman is highly admirable. Technically the movie is excellent with the realistic settings and praiseworthy camera work. Andha Yuddh is a movie which entertains though it is not meant to entertain. Instead it is meant to provoke thoughts in the audience. Let's not allow ourselves to be used by the selfish ones who might be willing to exploit our precious time and energy for their vested interests. Let's utilize our wisdom and strength for positive and desirable objectives, preserving them from the blind wars that might be imposed on us.\n",

This movie had been remade as ANGOOR with Sanjeev Guam and Devan Varma and also as BADE MIYA CHHOTE MIYA with Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda. Two set of twins are separated at birth and grow up unaware of each other and take each others place. Tanuja as Kishores love interest is OK. Kishore Kumar is restraint bur good as always and Asit Sen is, well Asit Sen. Though Angoor is also fun and BADE MIYA CHHOTE MIYA has Govinda and Amitabh Bachchan along with Ramyah and Madhuri Dixit this version is also worth seeing. The music is nothing special. The performances are routine and nothing extraordinary. The direction is OK. Still the film is worth a watch mainly due to Kishore Kumar and Tanuja\n",

            "I was 'Audiographer' or 'Sound Designer' for Loot Maar. This film's announcement boasted as the first Bollywood film to have 5 top villains of that time, in it. Popular film tabloid 'Screen' carried the announcement with pictures of Amjad Khan, Prem Chopra, Ranjit, Kader Khan and Shakti Kapoor. The film was produced at the Mehboob studios at Bandra, Mumbai. Mehboob studios has always been Mr. Dev Anand's favorite working place. He feels totally at home there. Mehboob studio has had permanent make-up room and the dress-room for Mr. Dev Anand, right from start. Now that he has made his own office premise called 'Anand Recording', he dresses up there before leaving for a shoot. A team of foreign visual effects generators was called to, create a sequence of camera traveling through universe before finally zooming in to the Earth. Film starts with this sequence. This was done in room of hotel Sun n Sand. The outdoor shoot of Loot Maar was done in the outskirts of Simla. We had made a set there too, that was constructed on an accessible road. So, it seemed like a real house. Entire shooting was done in winter. It was not very comfortable working on snow for more than 40 days. 'Jan Chhaye Mera Jadoo', became the biggest hit song of this film. It was sung by Asha Bhosle and was shot on Simple Kapadia. Another good number was 'Piya Hum Saat Mulk Ka Pani', shot on Dev Anand and Mehmood. Mehmood too had a interesting cameo in the film. This was Tina Munim's second film for Navketan, after 'Des Pardes'. Rakhee has been Mr. Anand's favorite actress. They have worked together in many films. Post production, like dubbing and sound effects of the film were done at Ketnav recording studio, belonging to Dev's brother Mr. Vijay Anand. The film was dubbed on a film 'rock n roll' machine. Mr. Dev Anand was very excited about the back-ground music of this film. The film was premiered at the Eros cinema in Mumbai.\n",

            "Vineet Khetrapal's 'Satrangee Parachute' could have worked as an enjoyable children's film had it not been for the terrorist track. It starts off well introducing us to a slice of life in a small town. It centres around a spirited adventurous little boy, Pappu, and his desire to learn about life outside Nainital and to tell his friends about it. The innocence of the children is beautifully displayed and the small town life is presented with a dose of humour. Khetrapal has also selected a beautiful location for the Nainital setting. The young cast, who play Pappu (Siddhartha Sanghani) and his friends, perform alright except that their dialogue delivery appears theatrical and rehearsed rather than natural. Zakir Hussain is very good as Pappu's father and Rupali Ganguly is superb. Kay Kay Menon and Rajpal Yadav provide fine support.'Santrangee Parachute' rapidly heads downhill after the terrorist angle is introduced. The movie resorts to violence and clichés (for example, portraying all the terrorists as Muslims). Moreover this subplot isn't developed at all.In the end, it's a forgettably okay fair that had potential of being more. Not too bad for a one-time watch with the family...\n",

            "Naukari (1954) : Brief Review -Bimal Roy's Comic and Tragic take on Horrors of Unemployment. Naukari is deservingly termed as Bimal Roy's one of most sensitive film because i feel this film doesn't have typical drama we see in other bollywood films. Especially, there is no happy ending which makes a big difference when you consider its release period. The film shows horrors of unemployment and it doesn't hesitate to keep it utterly horrible. Many films of that time have turned upside down just to please audience and let them leave with with happiness after the the film but Naukari was one of the big contradiction to that traditional filmmaking. The film is about the dreams and aspirations of the educated youth getting shattered as they struggle in the city for employment, in the ensuing years after India attained independence. Ratan Kumar Choudhary played by Kishore Kumar portrays that realistic and helpless struggler with immense honesty. Sheila Ramani as Ratan's love interest Seema also delivers an honest performance and even though it doesn't have much varieties, the character plays an important role in the climax. Bimal Roy had already made heartening film like Do Bigha Zameen (1953) which had very serious tone to it but with Naukari Bimal da brings that much needed comic touch. He crafts all the situations with his brilliant vision and execute it in proper cinematic manners. Watch out for that Letter burning scene which looks so ordinary when it happens but in next 5 minutes you know how important that ordinary scene was for the storyline. Naukari is also one of those rare films to have offbeat and peculiar combination of Comedy and Tragedy. Overall, Naukari is a hard film to watch for youth audience but it deserves to be watched by every single aspiring youngster to learn the most important message of their age. Don't forget this was just before Raj Kapoor's sensational blockbuster 'Shree 420'.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.\n",

            "Feroz Khan has always facinated me.Although he was a dashing looking man who had oodles of style and less of acting talent I really admired the movies he made.Feroz Khan can easily be said as the most stylish filmmaker this side of pacific.The movies which he made generally revolved around sex,violence and some great music.Still he would show these elements with such style that his fans still have fond memorie of the movies he made.His most famous movie as a film-maker has been Qurbaani,yet his other movies also carry the typical Feroz Khan stamp with much success.Last year when I was bed-ridden following an operation I decided to watch 'Apradh', the movie from where The Feroz phenomena began. Ram(Feroz Khan) is a dashing Formula-1 race driver(Karthikeyan is still trying to be one) and is in Europe to take part in the world championship.He is India's hope at the race.He meets a thief Meena(Mumtaz) by chance.Meena is on a move after stealing a Rs. 15 lakh necklace(2,00,000 U.S. dollars in those days according to the jeweller).Meena hides the necklace in Ram's attire in a moment of fear.Meena keeps getting back to Ram in search of the necklace as her bosses want the necklace.When Ram comes to know about the whole thing he not only rescues Meena from the gang but falls in love with her as well.In the meantime he manages to win the Formula-One race as well(Indians are still dreaming that one day some Indian will actually do this). After winning the race Ram decides to return to India.A stranger gives him a bottle which supposedly contains medicines which are meant for his elder brother Harnam.However the bottle contains diamonds and Ram is taken by the police. On being released and returning to India Ram feels that he will live a simple life and would not induge in any criminal activities.He marries Meena and they live happily till Harnam(Prem Chopra) comes to them.Diamonds and Meena create a misunderstanding between the brothers.To make matters worse one f Harnam's men breaks away from him and swears to kill Ram.After having lived the life of a criminal for long Harnam finally dies while protecting Ram from the bullets being fired from his own men. In 1993 when I watched Baazigar,I could not stop praising Abbas-Mustan for shooting a motorcar race in a hindi movie.Last year when I watched Apradh I was shocked to see that the hero of the movie is shown as a Formula One race driver.Clearly the story of Apradh written by Akhtar-Ul-Iman was way ahead of its time.It was aided by a tight screenplay and good dailogues.Another plus point of the movie is its good music.the songs 'Tum Mile Pyaar se...' and 'Hamaare Sivah..' are popular to this day.kalyanji-anandji formed a dream team with Feroz Khan starting with Apradh.Surprisingly they use Kishore(instead of Feroz's favourite Mukesh) as the voice of Feroz Khan which yields good results.Technically the film is brilliant.The cinematography,sound recording,action sequences,editing and above all the locations are absolutely fabulous. Feroz Khan looks his dashing best in Apradh.Although Feroz became a popular star in early star but he was famous for his supporting roles.This pushed him to become a filmmaker so that he gets a good lead role.Feroz acts quite well and fits in easily to the role of Formula One Race driver.Mumtaz also looks good and acts decently.The film has some bad acting by the side villains specially the actors who played the gang members of Mumtaz. However if there is one performance which lingers on even after the movie is over it is that of Prem Chopra's.Apradh is arguably Prem Chopra's best performance till date.In a role which gave him ample opportunity to be that bad guy yet be human and have emotions for his younger brother even till the end Chopra gives a sterling performance.Starting from Apradh was another Feroz Khan tradition that was followed in all F.K.International movies.The tradition was that the other lead actor would die in the end and will have a more power packed role as compared to Feroz himself.Whether it is Prem nath in Dharmatma,Vinod Khanna in Qurbaani,Anil kapoor in Jaanbaaz or Vinod Khanna in Dayavan,all followed this trend.It is quite surprising that Feroz never casted Prem Chopra after the success of Apradh. To say the obvious,Apradh belongs to Feroz Khan the filmmaker.His work as a producer is evident from the high class production balues of the movie.But it is his work as a director which really impresses.The western influence is very visible throghout the movie.Foreign locales,cabarets,gangsters and the murder of the lady in bath-tub show that Feroz was highly influenced by English movies.But Feroz surprised me the way he handled the emotional scenes and the bonding between the brothers.He is totally in form even while handling the most Hindustani emotion.The icing on the cake however is the way in which he has shot the Car Race.It is said that he shot the famous Nuremberg Car Race(Germany) with the aid of a prince from the royal family of the Leopolds.I am still waiting for any Indian director to show a car race similar to this one in a Hindi movie. Apradh when released in 1972 was a hit and it started the trend of Feroz Khan's stylised Hindi movies.Pros : Feroz Khan,Prem Chopra and car raceCons : : Overacting by some side villainsPlot : Good - Original and a good plotCast Performance : Good - Overall goodSoundtrack : Good - Except a fewCamera Effects : Very good - One of the bestWatch this movie with : Family\n",

The actors do a good job, especially the two step-sisters with their neither irritating nor over the top constant trifling quarrels and the best friend Raj with his charming and friendly manners. The lead actress manages to pull off a decent Cindarella. Unfortunately, her Prince, despite his good looks, wasn't convincing in his acting and his swimming abilities? He surely wouldn't win a gold medal for that.Throughout the film it was painful to witness Cindarella and her Prince, both aspiring WRITERS, texting each other...r u serious?

            "The central conflict of Sudarshan Thapa's directorial movie is love. Pair, who has got the pressure of marriage from family, does the false marriage which creates problem, is the crisis of the movie. Strong music, landscape shot of cinematography and development of relation between characters is the powerful peak. Hence, the weak point of 'PREEM GEET' is screenplay.Due to the weak screenplay main character is not established. Who lead the story (Protagonist) that is not defined. With the vague of counter idea, central conflict has the problem. Without growth of crisis, director has create crisis in rush. After the climax, crisis has disturbed the resolution.The real hero of PremGeet is Cinematographer Rajesh Shrestha. It is the first time in Nepali movie, which exposed Himalayas of Mustang that has not been framed before. Beautiful serenity of nature has been captured perfectly. We feel breathtaking after his eye-catching and meaningful shots. The next hero is Arjun Pokharel which music composition is influential. But, it has lack of cinematic language. It seems like radio drama, where can listen dialogues in every shot. Acting of Pradip, Pooja and Saroj Khanal is good feature\n",

            "Jeevan Dhaara is the story of Sangeeta Shrivastav, a young, smart and decisive girl. Sangeeta is the sole breadwinner of her extended family, which includes a helpless mother, an unemployed, alcoholic brother, a widowed sister, a sister in-law, and three kids, one of whom is blind. Sangeeta is already 25, she is in daily struggles with her life and she is longing for the day on which she will tie the knot. However, she knows that circumstances force her to remain unmarried and take care of the family, which was abandoned by her father. Sangeeta is the true man in the house and she is known for her tough and no-nonsense attitude with the members of the family, particularly with the kids. She is strict and uncompromising, but everyone knows that beneath this heavy mask lies a very vulnerable and kind soul. She sacrifices her own happiness by letting any incidental chances to get married and form her own family pass by. Jeevan Dhaara is quite authentic in its depiction, though the pacing is a bit slow from time to time and I would delete a few unnecessary scenes. The writing is good but at times it has a bit depressing mood to it, though it has its occasional joyful moments. The film's main sub-plot with Sangeeta's friend Kalpana, played by Simple Kapadia and her affair with her mother's lover is quite effective. Rama Rao Tanineni's direction is pretty good, and the music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal is appropriate. The acting is good. Jeevan Dhaara is Rekha's film all the way, and she is thoroughly compelling and moving as she always is, though this is clearly not one of her best parts. She manages to draw the audience's sympathy even though her character is quite unlikable. Raj Babbar is average as her alcoholic brother, and Amol Palekar is fantastic as usual.Jeevan Dhaara is a nice dramatic feature, it is simple, issue-based, and though I wouldn't call it a particularly great film, it is interesting and watchable mainly due to Rekha's beautiful portrayal.\n",

            "The best thing about this movie is it's cast. Each and every actor is a perfect fit for the character. Another good point is that you feel involved in the movie as if you are yourself a part of the family. The film is a situational comedy and is good in the first half but the comedy and situations look forced in the second half.*****Spoilers ahead**** I didn't get the logic of Pratap's staying in a guest house with Alka when he leaves the room at 6 in the morning and can come back only at 11:30pm in the night. So basically they are getting only 6.5 hours together and which is the exact same amount of time they used to get together at the family home. And who leaves his newly wedded wife at a strange hotel/ guest house the whole day, that too in days without the cell phone? On top of that Pratap tells her not to step out of the room. So she is supposed to remain locked in a strange room with no source of entertainment and nobody to talk to for the whole day and for what??? ****End of Spoilers* The music was also not good. Not even a single song. Music was atleast tolerable but lyrics were pathetic. But still the movie is worth a watch if you don't try to find any logic. Not for meaningful cinema watchers but for those who watch movies for the feel good factor.\n",

            "This review will be fun for me, if not for you, so please indulge me. Like so many Indian films, it could go on and on ...Do Kaliyaan was the first Indian film I had ever seen, back in 1968. No, I've not seen it again since then, but it left such a huge impression. I was freshly relocated to Kenya, which had a substantial Indian community and therefore a good supply of Indian films. My friends wanted to try something \"new\", so we went to the cinema.Wow! What an assault on the senses, in all ways. For one thing, the colours -- apparently all primary. The running time -- endless. The music, the songs, the dancing, at seemingly random intervals. The plot line -- all possible emotions one after another. Kids. More music. Being real about it, from my distant memory of this film, I thought it would *never* end.But I came to knew and appreciate a certain formula for Indian cinema, and up to this day, somehow I compare every film from there in my head with Do Kaliyaan, and if it were possible, yes, I would definitely watch it again.Thanks for reading!\n",

            "K. Pappu's 'Izzat Ki Roti' (aka 'Bread of Honour') is just another typical Bollywood masala (spice) flick from the early 90s. It's got all the ingredients for such cheesy movies. It's no classic (duh!) but corny entertainment. Now I had the remote control to fast-forward the more ridiculous sequences like the long dishum-dishum fight scenes. Now I probably wouldn't have considered watching this if it weren't for the supercute Juhi Chawla. She's very much cast as the typical heroine but her natural charisma, beauty and flair for comedy easily make her stand out. Meanwhile Farha fails to do much with a non-challenging thankless role. Rishi Kapoor is plain boring while Sunny Deol does surprisingly well in some of the comedic sequences (especially when he dresses in drag). With the exception of \"Keh De Khul Ke Keh De Duniyawalon Se\", the songs are fairly forgettable but Rishi Kapoor's atrocious dancing always provides some unintentional comic relief while Juhi Chawla gets to display some of her dancing skills with energy and grace. 'Izzat Ki Roti' is as forgettable as they come but it's certainly not the worst of its kind.\n",

            "\"Pratighaat\" portrays a city that is terrified of a mobster named Kali who is under the shelter of police and politics. No one can stand against his fury. A young lady fights for this against her family's will and job. On this backdrop, the film tries to raise a voice on patriotism and politics.The story is pretty exaggerated and is full of gore and violence. But the story stands for symbolism to the increasing violence, crimes in the city for which the film deserves an attention. Well, I won't say the film goes for a suitable answer by the end; but the story telling is quite remarkable in the film and the treatment is surprisingly different from the 80s movies.The film has a rawness and keeps you disturbed for most of the time. Perhaps the content won't be suitable to be watched with family. It manages to grip and comes close to an intense thriller. The special mention needs to go to the powerful performances given by Sujata Mehta and Rohini Hattangadi in their central roles. Besides, it would be unfair not to mention Nana Patekar in his earlier yet one of his best performances. Most of his dialogues make a satire to the current politics. Despite a non salable cast, the film manages to grip. Overall, the film raises the voices against the increasing crime and violence in the country and hints the unwillingness of the law and order to terminate it.Anyway, I have a reservation for this movie; and it's the lack of reality to the story which views the story in a fairy land where only a single mobster has the power to terrify the whole city with his fury. Perhaps the law and order of a city at present may not be that lame as portrayed in the film. Had the story been a bit real to life, \"Pratighaat\" would have been a remarkable film to be remembered for years. For a general watch, the film is gripping, intense and disturbing that you may not want to miss.Rating: 2 stars out of 4\n",

            "I watched Kalaakaar as a kid and I quite liked it. I knew I wouldn't really enjoy it as much today but I still decided to give it a try. Today I see it as another Hindi melodrama which is generally poorly scripted and directed, but I think it does have its moments. This is the story of Ravi Kumar, a young street guy who has a noticeable singing talent. When a young rich woman named Radha hears him singing one of the songs she penned, she asks her dad to help him. This marks the beginning of a successful career for Ravi, and more importantly a relationship between him and Radha, who are already deeply in love with each other. But problems arise soon, when Ravi is already at the top of his career; Radha is surprised by Ravi's sudden change in attitude as he is continuously ignoring her in every possible way. This comes to a peak when he does not acknowledge her contribution towards his success upon getting an award. Those who have watched Hindi films of this sort could successfully predict what this is all about.Kalaakaar starts quite well and the first half is fairly interesting. The second half, however, is very poor and it presents a certain twist that people today would compare to films like Kal Ho Naa Ho. The script is quite poor and the ending is particularly abysmal, being overly tragic and hard to believe. The leading role of Ravi is played by Kunal Goswami, who is hardly known today. He is very average in this film, although it's good that they did not cast some old guy to play a young achiever. Sridevi on the other hand is the film's saving grace where casting is concerned. She is very pretty and rises above the script with a convincing performance, doing pretty well even in the most terrible sequences. Well, and to the main reason this film is ever mentioned today, which is of course the music by Kalyanji-Anandji. \"Neele Neele Ambar Par\", brilliantly performed by Kishore Kumar, is the most memorable, and it is quite nostalgic for me. Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes, and the film itself is not recommended.\n",

            "Manmohan Desai started his career doing serious films but slowly ventured into masala films. This film released in 1972 fresh after the success of Sacha Jhutha(1970) which is also mentioned in the film. The film stars Randhir Kapoor in the lead role, and Rekha alongwith Shatrughan Sinha. The story is of long lost brothers, who separate in the initial reels after a catastrophe. Perhaps this was one of the earlier films to show a family that gets lost, which became a trademark of MDK films later like Amar Akbar Anthony, Suhaag, Mard.etc In the film Randhir plays a simpleton who goes to Mumbai to search his friend whose father helped his father when the separation happened. Randhir saves Rekha(In MDK's NASEEB he had a similar scene) from getting raped by thugs, soon they befriend each other Shatrughan Sinha plays a negative role, he is a leader of a gang who put Randhir's friend in trouble, he is the brother of Laxman who was taken away by a thief to make him like him. The film also has a get up formula wherein Randhir dresses as Louis Dsouza from Goa!!! All formulas which became a trademark of MDK.Direction is good Music by RD Burman was fab, Ghum Hai Kisi Ke became famous, other songs too are good, mostly sung by Kishore KumarRandhir Kapoor does a good job, looking suitably goofy for the role, though he couldn't make it really as big as Rishi Kapoor or other Kapoors yet he left a mark especially in this film. There is a scene where he dresses up like his father Raj Kapoor and there is a tribute to him. Rekha who looks different compared to today does a good job Shatrughan Sinha is terrific in a negative role, something he started his career with. The rest are all good in their roles.\n",

Finally the two-timing daddy is attacked by a criminal type and the step-bruddas must align forces to bash up all the baddies and save their daddy.The plot or lack thereof mainly provides an excuse for staging lots of elaborate songs and fights, done in a reasonably stylish way.

            "Sunil Shetty debuted with low budget films like Balwaan and continued with action films like Anth and Dilwale. However, his typical action films starting flop post 1994 and he didn't get a hit till Border(1997). Rakshak and Krishna were his only average runners from 1996 and that was only because of the superhit music.1997 was a different year for Sunil Shetty because he had critically and commercially acclaimed hits like Border and Bhai. However, the typical action potboilers still stayed because films like Judge Mujrim and Dhaal existed. This didn't let Shetty succeed fully but his fans still liked his typical action films. I am a fan of his too which is why I don't mind watching his typical movies but I prefer his critically acclaimed films like Border more than his typical films.Dhaal: The Battle of Law Against Law brings a hard hitting and correct issue of the corruption in India. The concept of how the criminals survive and escape prison because of bribed lawyers is good. However, the handling is quite mediocre at times making the movie succeed partially. The police risk their lives to catch criminals and these black coated lawyers just turn the whole case around making the cops frustrated. This is a typical issue for a Bollywood movie to exploit but the handling of the issue is good in certain parts. In fact, the well handled parts are the reasons why this film is worth watching.Direction by Sameer Malkan is superb in parts, mediocre is parts. He handles many scenes well but some scenes falter and the pace of the film isn't well maintained. Vinod Khanna's entry is well handled but the scenes between him and his wife Gautami are boring and slow the pace of the film, Sunil Shetty's entry is okay but the main story is completely sidelined because of the forced comedy. However, the scenes like Sunil outsmarting Danny in the court, most Amrish Puri scenes, Vinod Khanna getting framed, Sunil Shetty's arrest, and the enmity between Shetty and Khanna in prison are well handled. However, the climax is typical and could've been much better. Overall, his direction is somewhat decent yet could be better.Vinod Khanna does a terrific job as the frustrated cop, his anger is well acted. This is one actor who can play a hero's role even if he is overweight and old. Sunil Shetty hams and irritates initially but as the movie progresses, he does a decent job. He doesn't irritate with his crying or shrieking act like he used to in his films earlier. He is decent in the court scene and his action as usual is a delight to watch. Gautami does a fairly decent job as Khanna's wife, Anjali Jathar does an average job as the heroine, her role is short. Danny is good as the villain, his dynamic change is filmy though, Amrish Puri does good as the main villain but his dialogues are cheesy. The rest provide decent support.Music is OK but some of the songs weren't needed, they just slow down the film. The copied version of Macarena is the best song, the other songs are average. Action is well choreographed and is one of the highlights of the film. Editing is decent but some scenes could've been better edited.On the whole, Dhaal is an average Sunil Shetty flick which works perfectly in parts only. The film could've been better. The film isn't bad but it isn't anything memorable. The film is a decent timepass flick which will be enjoyed by Shetty's fans. Being a Sunil Shetty fan, I didn't mind watching the film though this isn't even as good as some of his better films like Border. Even Gopi Kishan(1994) was better than this, it was a better handled film. Sameer Malkan's own Main Khiladi Tu Anari(1994) and the flop Divya Shakti(1993) were better films than this. Yes, the film was a box office flop.\n",

Reena Roy marries Sunil Dutt on his return back to India.Overall the movie has a lot of Bollywood \"template\" like scenes (such as the one that gets Sunil Dutt married to Reena Roy) but it touches upon some important issues such as the NRI return back to India syndrome.

            "There was a time when horror films and comedy films were in the lower category when it came to mainstream cinema, but things have changed incredibly that we see that they are in the A list now and like Hollywood, filmmakers are combining both the elements together and are dishing out horror comedies. Abhinetri is one such film, but surprisingly it is not cheeky like most of its counterparts. The screenplay ensures that we get what we paid forentertainment.Krishna Kumar (Prabhudeva) is a 34 year old working in a advertising agency in Mumbai. He is desperate to shed his single status and get married to any girl as long as she is modern and has the right figure. As luck would have it a dying grandmother gets him married to a village girl Devi (Tamannah). Krishna despises Devi and keeps his marriage a secret from his colleagues. One day, he changes his mind and takes her to an award function sponsored by his company and Devi undergoes a dramatic transformation. She becomes a different woman, wears minis, dances, speaks flawless English and flirts around. Back home, she becomes the village girl, wears sari, speaks nothing but telugu and does not remember that she has been out. Krishna soon finds out through his neighbors that an aspiring actress called Ruby killed herself in the very house he is staying. It is clear Devi is possessed by Ruby. Ruby makes a deal with Krishna, he should let her use Devi's body to fulfill her starry ambitions and she would leave him and Devi alone. Krishna reluctantly agrees with a promise that Ruby should leave Devi's body the moment the first film is released.Ruby agrees, but soon we learn that she has other plans..Tamannah is spot on with both the characters, she effectively changes her body language for both the characters. The scenes where she threatens Prabhudeva and her dance sequence at the award show showcase her acting abilities which has surprisingly evolved over a decade. A Special mention is the scene where she sees herself for the first time on the screen at the premiere..her expressions speak volumesPrabhudeva is excellent when it comes to comic timing and the mandatory item song with Amy Jackson proves he is still the best of dancing stars around.even though the quality bar is dipping. Sonu Sood is good, carries off what little is expected of him. Music by Sajid wajid has more of a north flavor even though the film was originally shot in south. The songs are bad, but the music is good.Screenplay and direction by Vijay are excellent and lifts what could have turned into a mundane film to a well executed comic thriller\n",

            "Jangal Mein Mangal (merrymaking in a forest or to be exact, a deserted place) is an entertaining movie which is an underrated and forgotten entertainer of the seventies.Jangal Mein Mangal (1972) is a movie set completely in a forest (practically at Periyaar wildlife sanctuary, Thekkadi, Kerala) where two different groups of students reach a common Govt. guest house. One group contains all male students led by a strict disciplinarian - (retd.) Colonel M.K. Das (Pran) and the other one contains all female students led by equally strict disciplinarian - Professor Laxmi (Sonia Saahni). Quite naturally, romantic and comic encounters are there between the two groups as well as between their male-female leader duo. But the rom-com is intermixed with a crime-thriller also containing smuggling and murder tracks. After losing one beloved member from each group, the male-female groups are able to unmask the culprits.Jangal Mein Mangal starts very interestingly with animation pictures alongwith which the credits appear on the screen. And the entertainment starts immediately after the credits end, with the entry of the caretaker of the Govt. guest house (Paintal) who welcomes the female group. Promptly thereafter the female group comes across the male group and the colourful interactions take the viewer into their grip.Since there are two groups of students shown, the movie contains a plethora of characters. Pran is all-pervasive, for quite surprisingly and interestingly, he has been given a double role. Alongwith the leader of the male group - Colonel M.K. Das, he has played the role of a student in his group too, named Raghu. Though young romantic pair of Kiran Kumar and Reena Roy is there, in my opinion, the script is the hero in this movie and not any character. There are many twists and turns in the movie which does not bore the viewer at any place. The horror, suspense and thrill has been kept intact for the ending reels and the major part of the movie has been dedicated to the rom-com, containing teasings, games and songs. The scene in which love sprouts between Colonel Das and Professor Laxmi tickles all the romantic hearts.On the flip side, the villains seem to be outdated and over the top. Some characters are just like caricatures and some sequences (especially the sequence of the boys disguising themselves as girls and mingling with the girls) are not reliable. However since they serve the purpose of comedy, the director can be excused for them. Overall, the direction of Rajendra Bhatia is strictly okay and the script seems to be better than the direction. The murders in the final reels seem to be unnecessarily imposed on the story and they could have been avoided. The revelation of the identity of the murderer (who has been shown as scaring the forest-guests by masquerading as a ghost) does not spring any surprise which is the weakness of the direction.Shankar-Jaikishan with the help of amusing lyrics of Hasrat and Neeraj, have composed hilarious music for the movie which is in perfect sync with the mood of the movie. Kishore's romantic song - Tum Kitni Khoobsurat Ho, Ye Mere Dil Se Poochho is definitely the best song of the album. However Aye Baag Ki Kaliyon Sharam Karo & Aawaara Bhanwaron Sharam Karo are a treat to watch on the screen. Other songs are also good. I personally like Kal Ki Na Karo Baat sung by Kishore Da very much.Pran has got the maximum footage in his double role and this villain of yesteryears has excelled like anything. He has won the audience's heart with two different kinds of performances in two entirely different roles - one of an old man and one of a young man. The complete youth brigade of the movie (Kiran Kumar, Narendra Nath, Reena Roy, Meena T., Jayshree T. and likewise) alongwith Sonia Saahni have done pretty well. Paintal is also good. Meena Roy (played the role of a nun accompanying the girls' group), Chandrashekhar and Bharat Kapoor have also done satisfactorily. The baddies are disappointing. However a legendary actor like Balraj Saahni has been wasted in the role of an imprisoned Christian priest who is also the father of the nun.Jangal Mein Mangal is a long forgotten movie which provides wholesome entertainment in the style of Bollywood during the seventies. It's a spicy masala flick which is a treat for a typical Bollywood movie viewer. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all the entertainment-seekers. Come on, join the characters of the movie in Jangal (forest) and go for Mangal (enjoyment) with them.\n",

The story takes you logically to the final point and then it's all over, with the young boy gurning with intense emotion at the camera.Boy and sister find themselves reduced to poverty when their mother dies, but they find protection with a kindly hermit and a rich \"dancer\" with a past. The boy is working very hard to provide a meagre subsistence but then the sister (a young Nanda) goes blind causing a few more problems! The plot is expertly followed veering between a competent drama to laughable melodrama, but the interpolative music by Desai and Vyas more than make up for it. Lata sang only a few of the numbers - personally I missed her amazing voice, although Geeta Dutt did a fine job even if singing for the young boy. Favourite bits: the Girdhari hymn sung by Lata; the final plea Meri Aan Bhagwan sung by Geeta.An interesting and nice little film but teaching seemingly endless unassuming self-sacrifice when you have nothing will be eventually rewarded in improbable ways.\n",

            "This movie is a remake of an old Hindi Hit and Rajesh Khanna is playing the lead role. The movie is a tear jerker and is a good social drama. The movie has average music of Bappi Lahiri- but the supportive cast fails in delivering to the standards of Super Star Rajesh Khanna. Chunky Pande, Neelam and Dipika do not come close to the performance of Rajesh Khanna and seem a miscast. The direction and editing of the movie is okay, story is good and Rajesh Khanna's performance is excellent. However, it fails to get the support from the other cast members who do not look convincing at all. It is a must see for Rajesh Khanna fans and for people who like to see good family drama. It is a msut for Rajesh Khanna fans as he is superb in his role.\n",

            "Sunny Deol is one of Bollywood's action heroes but he too has acted in some of the worst action movies ever. Some of his films did extremely good at the b.o while others were runaway hits whilst others just flopped. It was some of those hits like Ghayal(1990), Narsimha(1991), Vishnu Devaa(1991), and Vishwatma(1992 that gave him the successes he needed in the early 90s.Mainly Ghayal got him that tremendous acclaim his career needed after the average 1980s period. However, the 90s too proved to be a time where Deol has his biggest successes whilst his not so successful films too. 1991 saw the release of many Sunny Deol films from which only Vishnu Deva, Narsminha succeeded. Films like Yodha,Shankara, and Veerta flopped. Veerta was one such film that turned out to be a dud for a Sunny Deol film. The film had the perfect formula for a hit Sunny Deol film but the film completely failed in parts and got letdown by several things.The plot is nothing great, it is about Mangal who comes to the city to visit his best friend. Mangal gets taunted and mocked for his poor English and typical villager style attitude. However, he soon learns the tricks of the city and becomes clever. With the help of his best friend, Mangal gets appointed as a responsible person in the factory. However, after a drastic step to frame Mangal of the murder of a crime he didn't commit, Mangal takes revenge and saves his friend from the villains.For a change, Deol doesn't only fight and fight without any reason. He provides some decent laughs and uses his clever instincts to trick and trap the villains. After all villagers aren't taken for granted, they too have brains. This is well shown in the film. However, what sucks is the editing again. Some scenes aren't well explained, the tempo of the film is bad in parts and it fails to create the entertainment other films of this type create. Moreover, the film drags and drags for a while until the interval point where the killers make their move.Direction by Shibu Mitra is decent, he makes a good film with good moments just like his hit film Paap Ki Duniya. If only he handled the film better in certain parts of the film, things would have been better.Performances are good, Mangal's friend makes a decent performance for a smart and kind friend. Sunny Deol as Mangal carries his innocent but clever village act quite well, his comic scenes are a delight. Jaya Pradha's role is not well edited as it becomes hard to presume who is her hero Mangal or his friend in the second half of the film but she does a good job. Prem Chopra is typecast yet he does a decent job as the cunning villain.Music is quite average but the Baily O Baily friendship song is quite decent, its catchy for a 90s song too.On the whole, Veerta is one of those films which were decent but somehow they became flops. Can't believe people liked Narsimha more than this. That was a violent crap film whilst this was a decent film.\n",

Most of these have made their point, very successfully. Unfortunately Sanshodhan was tepid. It had the feel of a TV film (Doordarshan) and one whose content unravelled as the film was being shot. Considering the overall story of the masses taking law into their own hands and asserting themselves is something Indian cinema has seen many great examples of, some from Mr Nihalani himself, this movie proved to be a weak infusion of already overdone plots in Indian cinema.\n",

            "If you are looking for action sequences and songs this is not the film for you. Only one song without an accompanying dance, and some brief dances without songs. Instead, this is more of a philosophical motion picture that makes you think throughout, for a change of pace. And if you don't know much about Buddhism, you will after viewing Trishagni. It is a love story at heart and yet the questions that are posed are just as important. We are given rules to follow in life and yet how can we say that our interpretations of them are always correct. The main characters of Nirvan and Ethi are wonderfully portrayed, as are the two monks who give lessons and at the same time are learning themselves each day. Although set in the past(the costume design is a big plus), the debates that are raised are eternal. The number of films using the desert as a backdrop are few, and each one is always benefited by it. For the ideas put in motion, the location scenery and the acting this movie is well worth watching. Not recommended for families though. Running time on this DVD is six minutes shy of two hours which is short for a film produced in India. The picture quality is fair, and full screen. A remastered edition would of course be preferred. Be warned about reading the plot summary on the DVD back cover and at other websites as they contain spoilers. Lastly, for those who require the optional English subtitles, you will have to be a speed reader at times!\n",

            "One of Bimal Roy's underrated works, Prem Patra is a soft love story against the back drop of the medical profession. Kavita Kapoor (a luminous Sadhana) and Arun Kumar (a very charming Shashi Kapoor) develop a liking for each other while finishing up their medical studies. A misunderstanding related to anonymous letters to Kavita causes Arun to be falsely accused and suspended from the college. A severely disillusioned Arun agrees to marry the illiterate daughter Tara (Seema Deo) of his landlord in lieu of a loan to finish his studies abroad.Arun, wanting to know his fiancée better, starts corresponding with her through letters. These are answered by Kavita, who happens to be Tara's cousin. Getting to know each other better through those letters, Kavita and Arun fall in love again. Tara, meanwhile starts liking Sudhir, one of Kavita's potential suitors. A mishap and some medical miracles later, everyone gets a happily ever after.The movie has a lot of filler scenes, particularly some featuring Rajendranath enacting the buffoon. Some things are conveniently coincidental, like Tara and Kavita's relationship. Still the movie is a great watch for some very strong supporting performances by Chand Usmani and for the ethereally beautiful Sadhana who is lovely as the slightly aloof, slightly heartbroken and infinitely vulnerable Kavita.The music, though not on par with the earlier Bimal Da chart busters has gems like \"Do Aankhiyan Jhuki Jhuki si\" , \"Yeh Mere andhere ujale na hote\" and the lyrical \"Sawan ki raaton mein\".\n",

            "After blockbuster Khalnayak(1993), Dutt went to jail for arms smuggling and all his films from 1993-1997 were flops except Aatish. Zamana Se Kya Darna is another routine film which follows the same aspects of other bollywood movies. Its like this, Bolly films that can't copy Holly copy other Bolly films. This movie too comes across spereation of family because of villains, become wealthy over time, long lost family members meet near the climax. The film is basically something which has been repeated for centuries. The screenplay is definitely not original(still not that bad), the climax was one of the only good parts of the film because it solves the problems that have been annoying to Dutt. It's not nice to always call even the not so good movies bad, but this movie is not in that position. It can be rather reffered to as an average flick. However, some scenes like Shakti's becoming cunning and knowning the truth is really weird. But, the film does not slow down and Dutt at the end beats up the bad people. The film is definitely not worth watching because it bores until the twist point but if your a die hard fan of Dutt and you don't complain as often as many people do, it's a movie for you. However, it is an average film that flopped during the time.\n",

            "Another fun Ramsay Brothers Indian horror flick! This one features a spectacularly fun monster, a sort of \"mummy\" made from the stitched back together bits of a dismembered would-be rapist, powered by the blood of an Evil Tantric Sorceror, and stowed away in the basement of a rural palace turned \"guest house\". The film has all the usual distractions one has to expect from an Indian flick, song and dance numbers, comedic subplots, uneven action sequences,etc. But it makes up for most of that with an atmospheric setting, lots of cobwebs and stormy nights, and--of course--there's a murderous MUMMY buried in the basement just waiting for a chance to stagger about inflicting grievous harm on everyone in range. Did I mention that the Mummy-monster also has magical Tantric powers and it's forehead throbs whenever it uses them? Great fun!! Particularly interesting for fans of Mario Bava, since this flick uses similar lighting techniques, lots of green and orange and blue gels against walls to produce a visually rich, if sometimes odd, horror flavor.\n",

            "Aamir Khan starrer recently released movie - Talaash has received mixed response from both the viewers and the reviewers. Some appreciated it for the well-knitted script, high emotional quotient and performances whereas some found themselves as cheated due to the presence of a supernatural element in the supposed earthly mystery. In my review, I have mentioned that the climax of Talaash reminded me of a very old Bollywood movie - Ek Paheli (1971). Today I am reviewing that only.The story of Ek Paheli (a puzzle) starts with the arrival of Sudhir (Feroz Khan) at Goa. He has returned from London after the demise of his father. Now to properly settle down in Goa, he decides to throw a party to introduce himself properly in the business and social milieu of Goa and also decides to refurnish his ancestral house afresh. Being a music-lover, he approaches a curio shop and picks up an old piano to purchase which appears to him as an attractive antique piece. There he happens to come across Maria (Tanuja) who tells him that she is very fond of that piano but being poor, cannot afford it. Sudhir gets attracted to her and allows her to correct a defective key of the piano by visiting his residence. He is also willing to invite her to the party being thrown by him at his residence but suddenly she vanishes from his house in quite a mysterious fashion when he is talking to his employee and confidante - Rocky (Rajendra Naath). In the party, a female guest is allowed to play the piano who falls dead in between of that act.Shortly thereafter, Maria visits Sudhir again at his residence. Sudhir feels himself as attracted to her but she is seen as attracted more to that piano that Sudhir has purchased. She likes playing it. The old servant of the house, John (Bipin Gupta) does not approve of Sudhir's life style and there happens a spat between the master and the servant. Shortly thereafter, John is found as dead. Since apparently John has been murdered, police inspector (Sanjeev Kumar) starts his investigation. Gradually it comes to fore that someone is actually after the life of Sudhir. The needle of suspicion in this regard points towards Shankarlaal (Madan Puri) who is Sudhir's late father's ex-business partner and his greedy sight is on Sudhir's wealth. Sudhir starts his own investigation too alongside police but quite mysteriously he crosses paths with Maria every now and then. He also meets with an accident in between. Maria plays a vital role in saving him from the evil designs of Shankarlaal and his accomplice, Rosy (Aruna Irani) also. Sudhir feels himself as in love with Maria but does not know anything about her. The mystery is finally unravelled when Sudhir approaches the missionary school which Maria has been a student of.The movie is suspense-filled and when I watched it first around two decades back on Zee TV, it proved to be quite engrossing for me because what got revealed in the end was something I could not imagine even in the wildest of my dreams. And the same thing happened in Talaash also which took me instantly down my memory lane and enabled me to contrast Talaash with Ek Paheli. All the same, Ek Paheli is a nice timepass not only for the mystery fans but also for the audience of the routine formula-based flicks which contain romance, songs, comedy, conspiracies of the villain and action. The first scene itself catches attention of the viewer who finds himself / herself as hooked for the next two and a quarter hours, trying to solve Ek Paheli (a puzzle) known as Maria in the movie. In Talaash, all the questions have been answered in the end but in Ek Paheli, the mystery of the death of the party guest has not been explained properly anywhere throughout the movie as to who did it as well as why and how.The role of Tanuja is the heart and soul of this movie. She looks not only very beautiful and a Goa-ni girl from every angle but she has performed also very well. Her gestures and mannerisms add to the mystery of the movie and keep the viewer engrossed. Dashing hero Feroz Khan has done well. His character has been developed in such a way that it fails to win any sympathy of the audience which is clearly the fault of the script-writer. All others are perfect in their respective roles.Technically the movie is okay. The beauty of Goa is visible in different scenes of this coloured movie. Since the interest of the audience is maintained continuously, the length also appears to be in order. Background score is also according to the mood of the movie.Usha Khanna has prepared good songs for this movie with the help of the lyrics of Asad Bhopali. The title track - Main Ek Paheli Hoon (sung by Suman Kalyanpur) and Mera Tumhaara Saath To Sadiyon Ka Saath Hai (a duet of Mohammed Rafi and Suman Kalyanpur) are ear-soothing quality songs. Aansoo Ki Ek Boond Hoon Main is also impressive which is again Suman Kalyanpur's solo.Though the script, the characters and the milieu of Talaash are entirely different from those of Ek Paheli but the spectators who see both these movies can contrast them for similarities in the basic grains. The intriguing thing about these two movies that came to my notice is that the way the long explanation in the end through flash-back in Talaash has been found as boring by many viewers, the similarly boring explanation through flash-back is there in Ek Paheli too. If we consider the quality of the screenplay, the direction and the performances; then definitely this more than four decades old movie is a couple of notches below Talaash. Nevertheless it's an interesting movie.\n",

The dialogues, screenplay were hurriedly written and could have been made better. Bappi Lahiri's music is not jarring. Shabna Azmi puts in a good performance but Shatrughan Sinha screams his way in the movie and looks a misfit.

            "Sudhendu Roy's Uphaar is one wonderful film relating the story of Minoo, a young village girl who is still a little kid by heart. Minoo is a highly mischievous prankster, and her parents get daily complaints from villagers who keep grumbling about her inappropriate behaviour. Soon her parents marry her against her will to a young student named Anoop, who previously instantly fell for her in spite of her childishness. The film follows Minoo's life as a young bride, her lack of acclimation to her new surroundings where she still refuses to grow up, and ultimately her coming-of-age and maturation.Based on Rabindranath Tagore's short story Samapti, Uphaar is a brilliant little film. It is very authentic and at points reminds one of some of Shyam Benegal's then-future pictures. Sudhendu Roy directs it with a lot of heart. He captures the spirit of the small village and keeps everything simple and real, yet without ever making it look overly banal. There isn't a single dull moment in the film and I personally was kept on the edge of my seat throughout the show. The sequences showing Minoo's sudden realisation of having fallen in love and her subsequent regrets and pain are the film's best.The more I watch Jaya Bhaduri in different movies, the more I appreciate her abilities. I think she was probably the best actress of those years in mainstream Hindi cinema. She was professionally trained in acting, and while her skills are evident, she is just such a gifted natural talent (as previously evidenced in Satyajit Ray's Mahangar in which she acted when she was still a teenager). She is superb in this movie. Everything about her is real, spontaneous and genuine, and here she plays the spoilt brat with great conviction. Her character's transformation and coming-of-age are brilliantly played.Apart from Bhaduri, who clearly owns this show, the supporting cast is in top form. The one who impressed me the most is Kamini Kaushal, who is outstanding as the weary mother in-law. Swarup Dutt is very fine as the patient, soft-spoken and kindhearted husband. For me Uphaar was a very enjoyable film. Sudhendu Roy is better known as an art director for many popular movies. This film was his first directorial venture and sadly he did not go on to direct that many movies and stuck to his main job. Anyway, Uphaar is a worthy film and a little-known gem which is highly recommended.\n",

The story just followes one pattern, his parents got killed he goes to a temple, he is adopted by a priest and he grows up being a macho man looking for his parents killers. When he finds them, he starts killing them one by one. The movie is really nothing new, it is a story we have heard millions of times and the comedy is bogus. If there is anything that stands out, it is acting and action. The two A's of this movie is outstanding. Sunny Deol proves himself by putting more effort into his wodden acting from the 80's and his action is incredible. Aditya Pancholi is a newcomer and in his third movie, he doesn't disaapoint. Neelam is a good actress and her comic timings are good. Sangeeta Bijlani is always average, the only thing good about her is her sleveless clothes making her look good. Sunny's action is remarkable, it is just too good. His expression is nice.Overall: An average campy movie from the early 90's\n",

            "Only Nana Patekar's dialogues.The movie didn't have a story, songs, and creativity at all.Absurd movie in total which has no interest or engagement plan.Not more than a part of an ordinary drama.I think the writer didn't convey the message at all.\n",

            "I watched this film and thought some may say the film's subject has been repeated before felt it was a decent attempt from Govinda considering he made it on a low budget with no really big stars or big publicity.Personally i do not see why many critics and people complain about the subject being old. Look at films like Hum Saath Saath Hain, Dil to Pagal Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Haven't the subjects they been based on been repeated before? So why complain about Sukh when even directors like Yash Chopra, Karan Johar have picked themes that have been before? Beats me.Anyway, what could have help this film is a better director. Govinda's brother Kirti Kumar (actual name Kirti Ahuja) directed this film and he has not been able to capture the magic he had in Hatya. Hatya remains his best film and this film doesn't change that. Unfortunately he fails as the director to infuse some life in the script.Govinda does a good job. At least he has tried something different and to be fair he does do a good job. There is a certain honesty and sincerity about his performance especially towards the end. The only thing i say is he should get himself into shape. A fitter Govinda is much better even if the films are not doing well.Preeti Jaganani is o.k, she looked comfortable opposite Govinda despite the age difference. They do share good chemistry and i hope they star together in better films and with Govinda trimmed down. Chunky Pandey isn't that bad but the chemistry and spark between him and Govinda is not as great as it was in Aankhen. Aarti from my view wasn't great but not bad either, i didn't really have any complaints of her character or performance.The film shows how sometimes the simplest of men can become greedy for money in today's world and how trust and love is important for a successful marriage.I don't think the film isn't really a film for teenagers or young adults. It is more aimed at the elderly and couples in their 30s and mid to late 20s from my view but i might be wrong.The film is worth a watch for Govinda and the message it is portraying. A decent attempt by Govinda but direction would have made it even better.My Rating- 6/10\n",

I will recommend this movie only to those people who wants to take revenge on their in-laws or friends or wants to do a soft kill of their enemy. Take them to this movie, i am sure they will die instantly. I am sure when the director took this movie, he took only his relatives into consideration who have acted in this movie, nothing else. Had he taken the audiences, he would have at least pumped in some story/plot something to vaguely remind us that we do have brain. But alas, this fellow has completely ignored all this logical sensibility's. The best ever thing that happened in the movie is the climax, i laughed, laughed and laughed. Can you imagine someone planting a bomb on a Foot ball and thats going blast and kill all the spectators, instead of moving the spectators, the hero gives a rousing speech, to the people of India, his friend, friends father and his lover then kicks the ball into the air, where the bomb harmlessly blasts and everyone is saved. Wah Wah. What a plot, what a climax. You will laugh your heads off. Stay clear out of this movie. Never to be watched not even on trailers.\n",

            "'Don Muthuswami' is a subject, which would've clicked all the way in the 80's and 90's, but in 2008 not sure. The film is a remake of the Stallone hit 'Oscar', but our real concern is that does the film entertain. To answer that simply - Mithun can never be doubted. The film is does entertain and the film is truly funny at times and the credit goes to 3-time National Award Winner. He is the life of the film and minus him the film would've fallen flat. 'Don Muthuswami' has some really funny moments and has a trump card: Mithun, but otherwise its a routine fare with a lot noise and action running throughout. To sum up, A fairly decent entertainer!Performances: As mentioned earlier, Mithun is the life of Don Muthuswami. Rohit Roy is terrific. Hrishita bhatt is alright. Mohit Raina is fare. Shakti Kapoor, Vishal Kotian, Rakesh Bedi and Dilip Joshi are funny in their roles. Others are adequate.on the whole 'Don Muthuswami' aka Sir Muthuswami is the only trump card the venture has to offer.\n",

            "This is the second Bollywood movie I've seen (the first being \"Sharabi\"), and I enjoyed this a lot more. The following plot points were given in Netflix's summary, and thereby cannot be considered spoilers. Vishal (Dharmendra) and Aruna (Sharmila Tagore) are very much in love. However, when Aruna finds out that she is going blind, she marries her elderly employer (Ashok Kumar) so that she won't be a burden to Vichal, who already has to take care of his handicapped mother (Achala Sachdev). Deven Verma provides comic relief.The first act of this film is a bit overly melodramatic. It takes a western viewer a while to get used to the in-your-face close-ups and other staples of old-school Bollywood cinema. However, the acting is very good. Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore are good as two young lovers. Ashok Kumar is quite good as a magazine executive with a heart of gold. However, the best actor does not show up until the beginning of the second act: Leena Chandavarkar as Kumar's daughter. She acts evenly with her whole body, and the fact that she's easy on the eyes doesn't hurt her performance. She simply has the best chemistry with all of her co- stars, especially with Sharmila Tagore. In their scenes together, the unique chemistry that develops when two women the same age take on the roles of mother and daughter is captured brilliantly. Chandavarkar's scenes with Dharmendra are also very good. Even when the script becomes overly misogynistic, Chandavarkar's presence is stronger than her male counterparts. Also, the woman who plays the friend of Aruna in a small role is very good and sexy, but I couldn't find her name.Even though I'm praising the acting, why am I only calling the movie decent? The story. For starters, characters have a habit of appearing out of nowhere in scenes, particularly Kumar's character. Also, a lot of times the plot is like a soap opera. Sometimes the action depends on events so nonsensical that they ruin the mood. All of this would be tolerable, however, if it wasn't for the dénouement. Without giving anything away, this movie's dénouement breaks the original mood of the film so severely that the last fifteen minutes just become annoying. Everything else about the movie was very good, but the dénouement was so awful that it almost ruined the movie for me.\n",

            "This movie is one of the early works which brought Rishi Kapoor & Neetu Singh as a hit pair in the 1970's.The story revolves around Rishi Kapoor, who is conceived as a bad person, while the fact is he is kind but being misunderstood by others. He falls in love with Moushumi Chaterjee, and gets rejected by her family, who gets her married to somebody else. He then falls in love with Neetu Singh after so many hate and fights between the two of them. The rest should be seen to avoid spoiling the surprise elements in the film.The movie has some melodious songs like \"O Hansini\", which is still popular till date.Watch it if you like to see the magic of the hit pair Neetu & Rishi.\n",

            "If viewers think that Saudagar(1991) was the only clash of the 2great Kumars,Dilip and Raj,then they should think once more.32 years beforeSubash Ghai's blockbuster,S.S. Vasan casted the 2 stars in his super hit movie Paigham in the year 1959.Although here it has to be mentioned that at that time Dilip Kumar was at the peak of his carrier and Raj Kumar was a rising star and this is evident in the movie where unlike Saudagar(in which both of them had equalroles),here Dilip Kumar is easily the hero of the movie where as Raj Kumar is the supporting actor.Nevertheless,still the movie is a treat to watch for their clash. I watched this movie last year on Star Gold(almost 43 years after its release) and must say that it is really a good movie and has not lost its charm over the years. The movie is a story of 2 brothers (Raj Kumar and Dilip Kumar).While the elder brother Ram(Raj Kumar) is a worker in a mill,the younger brother Ratan(Dilip Kumar) is studying engineering in a different city and also works part-time as a rickshaw puller.He falls in love with the Manju(Vyjanthimala) when she once travels in his rickshaw.After completing his studies Ratan returns to his native place and starts living alongwith his elder brother and hisfamily.The mill owner(Motilal) is impressed by the young engineer and employs him in his mill.Manju also joins the mill and their love story blooms,much to the anger of the mill owner's daughter as she also likes Ratan.The elder brother respects the mill owner and sees him as a Godly figure.However the younger brother Ratan after working for sometime in the mill realises that the mill owner is a shrewd,cruel businessman.He talks to the mill workers and ask them to put their demands to the owner.When the demands are not met he asks them to revolt.Circumstances lead to a confrontation between both the brothers.Raj Kumar throws Ratan out of thehome.However after some tension filled atmosphere both the brothers unite and the mill owner repents his earlier deeds and grant the workers their due. The movie has both social and family value.The concept of an engineer working alongwith the workers and even fighting for their rights again appeared in Yash Chopra's classic ''Kala Pathar'',where Shashi kapoor played the engineer.Even a later Dilip Kumar starrer ''Mazdoor'' had echoes of Paighaam. The story of Paighaam is good and the screenplay gets the viewersinterested.Ramanand Sagar's dailogues carry the right weight and punch and it fetched him the Filmfare Award for the best dailogues in 1959.S.S.vasan's direction is good.The film being a Gemini Production had great production values.Earlier in 1955 Vasan and Gemini had collaborated in making the Dilip Kumar-Dev Anand action hit ''Insaniyat''.However it was after Paighaam that Vasan became a name to reckon with.Interestingly Akhtar Mirza had offered the strory of 1957 social-musical blockbuster ''Naya Daur'' initially to S.S.Vasan alongwith Raj kapoor and it was only when both of them rejected it it went to B.R. Chopra and he made a classic movie out of it.So Paighaam is kind of Vasan's interpretation of a star-stuedded,social,musical and entertaining yet meaningful popular cinema.He succeeds in making Paighaam an amazing movie.C.ramchandra's music is not that great.Still 3 numbers are very good.The bhajan''Ameeron ke parmeshwar..'',the title track''yahi Paigham hamara' and the comic ''kaise Diwali manaayein..' have fine tunes and good lyrics by Pradeep. Now the performances.Dilip Kumar clearly rises above the entire cast and shines in every frame of the movie.His dailogue delivery,expression and body language again prove that he is one of the best actors India has ever seen.As the young engineer who works hard and even fights for the workers rights,Dilip shows his capability as an ace star and actor.His romantic scenes withVyjanthimala are also brilliant.The scene where he teases Vyjanthimala by telling her an imaginary romantic incident with another girl was ''lifted'' by Salim-Javed for Amitabh bachchan and Zeenat Aman in the 1980 hit ''Dostana''.Vyjanthimala also delivers a fine performance.The chemistry which Dilip-Vyjanthi generated on screen was amazing.Paighaam was their 4th consecutive hit in the 4 years,Devdas(1956),Naya Daur(1957) and Madhumati(1958) being other.In this movie the director gives her ample scope to show her acting as well as dancing capabilities.Raj Kumar as the elder brother gives a very controlled performance.He never goes over thetop and matches Dilip's legendary status in the scenes where both of them come together.Motilal as the shrewd(but not a cardboard character) gives a great performance.Although he played a shrewd businessman in Anari (which was the other Big hit of 1959)as well,still he manages to perform this role in a different manner.Johny Walker as the cook gets some good scenes and a famous song(Kaise Diwali manaaye hum Lala,apna to 12 mahine Diwaala) and he does justice to them. An incident relating to the shooting of Paighaam holds curiosity.In a scene where Raj Kumar had to slap Dilip Kumar,it is said that the eccentric Raj actually slapped Dilip hardly.However,Dilip the true professional did not retaliate.If this incident is true then its interesting to note that a very similar incident happened on the sets of Roti,Kapda aur Makaan.In a scene where Manoj Kumar had to slap AmitabhBachchan in a scene Mr. Bharat got too involved in the scene and actually hit the Big b.Big B however followed in the footstep of his idol Dilip Kumar and like a true professional did not retaliate. These co-incidences not-withstanding Paighaam is a movie worth watching for its social values and most importantly for the clash between both the Kumars.\n",

            "The name of this picture is a direct takeoff from James Headly Chase's novel, 'The World is in My Pocket'. At times serious and at times somewhat crazy, this movie has some thrills to satisfy your thrill loving taste buds. The heroes (Shashi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor) are supposed to be skilled trapeze artists and so is villain (Ranjeet). Only Rishi has some romance to do here not Shashi. Yet Shashi is in good form and at his charming best. When he loses both his legs in an accident, kid brother Rishi takes over the task to find the culprits. You need not you to stretch your imagination too far, as per the Hindi movie tradition, good guys win. Tinu Anand's direction looks skilled, being a Satyajit Ray pupil, he should have made some more worthy pictures anyway.Spicy Timepass. 6 out of 10.\n",

            "The title \"Chanel N°5: The Film\" summarizes very well what you get here. These 3 minutes are basically a long perfume commercial without any real reference to the product though. This was made back in 2004, shortly after actress Nicole Kidman's Oscar win and she unites with another of Australia's most known, namely director Baz Luhrmann. Add to that Rodrigo Santoro, whose career after 300 also did not go as well as people may have thought. But back to this one here: The best thing you could say about is that it is very much on the style over substance side. Buthonestly calling the visual as well as the audible side utterly pretentious would be more accurate. Now we see where the millions of dollars people pay for Chanel perfumes are going, namely in the purses of Nicole Kidman and others. If you are a really huge fan of her, then maybe you can check this one out. Otherwise I highly recommend skipping it as I really cannot think of a single reason to see it in terms of production values. Don't be fooled by the rating here on IMDb.

            "\"Dili Ka Thug\" (Trickster of Delhi) is a movie revolving around Kishore (Kumar) who gambles and tricks people to make money. On being confronted by his mother, he decides to find a job and lands one in Mumbai, where he continues wooing Asha (Nutan). Kishore's father and his friend were murdered by a notorious Anantram who now wears a mask to hide his true identity and continues manufacturing spurious medicines and also passes as Nutan's uncle. The firm employing Kishore is run by Anantram and his two henchmen-Sevakram and Bihari. Anantram goes to murder Kishore in the hospital but drops his monocle which makes Iftekhar suspicious-he manages to take Anantram's fingerprints on SohanLal's wallet and figures out the truth. What follows is a dramatic air-borne sequence where Anantram is beaten by Kishore and shot by Nutan. Kishore manages to land the aeroplane after the pilots lose their consciousness...and as they say all's well that ends well.The first half of the movie is slow and would have been a drag but for the presence of the inimitable Kishore Kumar. The director makes up for the first half in the latter half of the movie as the events unfold quickly before the story reaches its climax. One also gets to listen to some very memorable songs-a water ballet \"ye bahar ye sama, ye jhoomti jawaniyan\" and then \"hum to mohabbat karega..\" followed by \"CAT..\" showing Kishore doing his hilarious earth-shaking moves and then the beautiful duet \"ye ratein ye mausam..\" Its like going back in time...only by 49 years and a sad realization that none of the actors who played a pivotal role in the movie are alive but their memory lingers on (other than the singer Asha Bhonsle) (Sanjeev Logani :-))\n",

This movie made by the movie Mogul BR Chopra has Rajesh Khanna playing the role of a man torn between two women. The female leads are played by Vidya Sinha and Shabana Azmi, who do their roles well but the movie centers around Rajesh Khanna and the effect predictions can have. Ultimately predictions are proved wrong and prayer and Karm rule. A good movie made with good intentions and very well presented. The weak link is average music by R D Burman or may be the director did not create situations for a nice song. The lyrics are heavily loaded, however a charming and a good clean movie of the SuperStar.\n",

The strongest & most popular compositions being 'Mitwa Re' with vocals by Kumar Sanu & Alka Yagnik, the title song 'Maa Ki Mamta' & 'Tum Dono Ho Ek Se' by Lata Mangeskar, Hariharan & Sudesh Wadkar and 'Aandhi Hai Jandhi Hai' by Sukhwinder Singh & Hema Sardesai.Worth the watch and guaranteed to keep you entertained till the end!\n",

            "An authentic view of a lower middle class Indian family set in the fifties. Its about a young immature man's (with political ambition) turmoil when forced into arranged marriage. The generation gap between young and old, the jealousies of women in the family, the difference between the domesticated and the rebellious are well depicted. On one side it's a satire on how unprepared young minds are forced into marriage, on the other side how two strangers locked into matrimony slowly discover each other. An obscure movie with a lot of class!\n",

            "Great movie - Naseeruddin shah plays a blackmailer but brings in comedy, sarcasm to his role. Shashi Kapoor is quite handsome and delivers one of the most underrated performances. Raj Kiran , hope he returns back gives a terrific performance and Reena Roy plays one of the best roles, her role is very respectable and very underrated. Story is very good. A watch is recommended and also for the songs. Songs are very soulful and melodious.\n",

            "Dharmendra and Vyjantimala make a good pairing this Hindi film coated with melodrama. It's typical \"first hour is romantic before things get serious\" but it's fun film festered with some good songs such as the title song, first song Dharmendra sings to Vyjantimala. Of course, she gets the chance to display her dancing skills.The story revolves around a missing father, a daughter suspecting it was foul play, and a mix up between two children going to the wrong parents - something Pran, at his villainous self, takes advantage of with the help of his equally villainous mother ( the apple don't fall far from the tree). The films rounds off with a fight scene with Dharmendra taking on the bad guys. A fun 60's Hindi film.\n",
